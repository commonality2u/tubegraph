Guy Spear is an investor known for his deep study and application of [[principles_of_value_investing | value investing]] principles, heavily influenced by legendary investors like [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] and [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Charlie Munger]]. For 25 years, Spear has immersed himself in their teachings, reading every annual letter, report, and studying their growth strategies to not just learn in theory but also practice their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. His journey highlights how dedicated study and specific practices can shape an investment philosophy focused on long-term compounding and personal well-being.

## The "Posy" Study Group

Early in his career, driven by a desire to emulate [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]]'s [[principles_of_value_investing | value investing]] approach, Guy Spear became involved in a group in New York City known as "the Posy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. This group was formed by Whitney Tilson, a "master networker," and brought together five or six individuals fascinated by [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] who wanted to become better investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.

The Posy met regularly, sometimes weekly, in a member's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:46">[02:37:46]</a>. The core activity involved members presenting written stock ideas, which would then be discussed in depth for about 30 to 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:46">[03:57:46]</a>. Notable members included Bill Ackman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. Beyond structured discussions, unstructured interactions where members shared insights and information (e.g., notes from conference calls before transcripts were widely available) were highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:03">[05:01:03]</a>. Spear recognized the group as a powerful tool for success, akin to study groups he had experienced in business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>. The Posy met for two to four years and remains connected through an email chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:04">[03:19:04]</a>.

## Lessons from the Field: The Farmer Mac Story

Guy Spear's early investing career, while backed by a Harvard MBA, was initially marked by fear and a recognition that he "didn't know what I was doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:45">[06:01:45]</a>. His strategy involved studying successful investors like [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] and Tom Russo, then attempting to reverse-engineer their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:35">[06:12:35]</a>.

One significant learning experience involved Farmer Mac. Spear had invested successfully in Freddie Mac, following [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]]'s investment path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:11">[07:16:11]</a>. He then sought similar government-sponsored enterprises, leading him to Farmer Mac, which dealt with farm loans similar to how Freddie Mac handled mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:04">[08:18:04]</a>. He presented Farmer Mac to the Posy, seeing it as the "next Freddie Mac and Fanny May" with significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:32">[09:03:32]</a>.

However, Whitney Tilson informed him that Bill Ackman was taking a massive short position in Farmer Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:07">[09:31:07]</a>. Ackman contacted Spear, explaining he believed the company was "borderline fraudulent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:16">[09:58:16]</a>. Spear visited Ackman's office, where he saw extensive files of public filings that Ackman had meticulously downloaded and analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:31">[10:25:31]</a>. Ackman demonstrated that Farmer Mac's "mortgage-backed securities" were fundamentally different from Freddie Mac's, consisting of a very small number of large business loans rather than a diversified pool of small mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:44">[11:08:44]</a>. This exposed a critical lack of depth in Spear's own analysis, as he had "taken them at their word" without downloading the documents himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:27">[11:00:27]</a>.

Recognizing his oversight, Spear immediately sold his Farmer Mac shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:44">[13:08:44]</a>. A subsequent meeting with Farmer Mac's management, attended by Spear, Bill Ackman, and Whitney Tilson, further confirmed Ackman's assessment when the CEO gave a weak response to Ackman's pointed questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:36">[13:25:36]</a>. This experience taught Spear the crucial lesson of doing thorough, deep analysis, especially when exploring less-trodden investment paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:42">[15:11:42]</a>.

## Shifting Mindset: Beyond "Gordon Gekko"

Spear describes himself as having been a "Gordon Gekko wannabe" in his youth, focused on being rich and powerful on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:07">[28:26:07]</a>. His time at DH Blair, a firm modeled after Stratton Oakmont from "Wolf of Wall Street," highlighted this initial ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:58">[28:36:58]</a>. However, a significant turning point came through attending Tony Robbins seminars and engaging in self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:07">[29:01:07]</a>.

Initially skeptical of Robbins, Spear's participation in a firewalk profoundly shifted his perspective. He realized that "if you have the right psychology and you have the right physiology there are extraordinary things that you can do as a human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:14">[21:53:14]</a>. This experience prompted him to dive into NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) and self-help literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:32">[23:11:32]</a>.

A key "rewiring" for Spear involved overcoming an arrogant attitude that he was smarter than most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:04">[25:10:04]</a>. Inspired by Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People," he realized the importance of remembering and using people's names and engaging in positive, reciprocal interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:05">[26:07:05]</a>. He consciously adopted the practice of writing handwritten thank-you notes daily, even when he didn't genuinely "care" about the recipients at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:41">[31:18:41]</a>. This disciplined action, he found, actually "changed my insides, made me care about them a little more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:40">[33:41:40]</a>. This aligns with the concept of the reticular activating system, where intentionally looking for positives or reasons to appreciate trains the brain to find them, leading to a more grateful and caring disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:04">[34:42:04]</a>.

[[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] himself exemplifies this principle, sending personalized holiday cards to people like Guy Spear, demonstrating a profound understanding of [[the_interplay_between_money_success_and_personal_values | relationship building]] and reciprocity that costs little but yields significant goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. Similarly, Kobe Bryant's practice of remembering small details about people, such as calling a trainer's mom on her birthday or remembering a casual joke, highlights how simple, lightweight actions can have a huge, lasting payoff in personal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:04">[41:14:04]</a>.

## Investment Strategy: Compounding and Avoiding Ruin

Spear views [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | investing]] not as a "fighter pilot" aiming for precision hits, but more like bowling with bumpers: the goal is to "just trying to keep it off the edges" and ensure that even bad misses don't lead to ruinous losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:17">[43:46:17]</a>. This contrasts with the tendency to be overly impressed by apparent "lottery winners" like Google or Jeff Bezos, whose success might be attributed more to randomness (as per Nassim Taleb's "Fooled by Randomness") than replicable strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:07">[44:40:07]</a>. Spear's focus is on setting up his life and [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | investment strategies]] to succeed "well enough no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:53">[45:40:53]</a>.

His dedication to [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_early_entrepreneurial_experiences | Warren Buffett]]'s methods was intense, bordering on desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:47">[47:48:47]</a>. He would obtain annual reports of companies [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Buffett]] had invested in, like Coca-Cola, from years *before* Buffett's investment, to try and read them through Buffett's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:21">[46:25:21]</a>. This immersive practice of "cloning" or "modeling" what successful people do is seen as a fundamentally human way of learning and achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:46">[51:05:46]</a>.

Spear often asks, "What would [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] do in my shoes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:28">[52:13:28]</a>. This mental exercise allows him to tap into the wisdom of his virtual mentor, even without direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:19">[52:04:19]</a>. This is part of what Tony Robbins calls "the technology of success"—a systematic approach to emulating desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:05">[52:37:05]</a>.

Another core principle for Spear, influenced by Monish Pabrai and Jim Collins' "Good to Great," is the "two gas stations across the street" metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:54">[53:01:54]</a>. This illustrates how one business succeeds by implementing small, replicable improvements (e.g., painting the wall, washing windshields) that the competitor across the street could easily copy but fails to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:54">[53:27:54]</a>. Spear realized he was often "the guy on the other side of the road," failing to copy the simple, effective actions of mentors like Monish Pabrai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:26">[54:30:26]</a>. This led to focusing on building "engines" within his business – repeatable, scalable processes, like generating goodwill or managing prospect interactions efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:06:55">[55:06:55]</a>.

Despite periods of underperformance relative to benchmarks like the S&P 500 (e.g., seven or eight years of underperformance within his 25+ year career), Spear maintains his focus on compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. He understands that the investment game is an "infinite game" with no clear end or defined winner/loser, unlike "finite games" like chess or football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. The objective is to stay in the game and compound over the long term, avoiding "implosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Owning [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_early_entrepreneurial_experiences | Berkshire Hathaway]] helps him maintain his internal wiring and stay committed for the long haul, as opposed to an impersonal index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

## Cultivating a Fulfilling Life

Spear advises considering the long-term consequences of actions: "If I do the same contemplated action given the same set of circumstances throughout the rest of my life how's it going to turn out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. He applies this to daily decisions, such as saying no to meetings that deviate from his core focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. This aligns with [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]]'s wisdom of avoiding the "just this once" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

He also encourages asking, "If everybody in the world did this contemplated thing that I'm contemplating on doing what would the world look like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. A world where everyone strives to be like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, he suggests, would be "utterly miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. Instead, he envisions a more beautiful world where individuals pursue their own fulfilling paths, like being a "watchmaker" or a "novelist," rather than always aiming for a grand scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. The key is to find what is personally satisfying and act in accordance with that, recognizing that diverse roles are essential for a healthy ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

For those interested in learning from the [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Buffett]]-[[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Munger]] school of thought, Spear recommends starting with the source: [[the_influence_of_charlie_munger_and_warren_buffett | Buffett]]'s annual letters, transcripts, and recordings of annual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, as well as Charlie Munger's "Poor Charlie's Almanac" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. However, his more crucial advice is to "iterate quickly" with reading material: if a book or essay isn't providing valuable insights or "win after win," put it down and find something else that resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. He famously likens his library to a cocktail party, where one can "mix and mingle and hop from one conversation to the other and if it gets boring you go grab a drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>. This flexible approach ensures that learning remains engaging and personally beneficial.

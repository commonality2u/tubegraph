Conor McGregor captivated audiences with his unique blend of entertainment, success, and mindset, becoming the speaker's favorite athlete at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. His trajectory from an apprentice plumber on welfare to the highest-earning athlete and a global star within six years was "unbelievable to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. While described as "trashy" or an "Irish redneck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>, his charisma, magnetism, and profound self-belief were evident from early on, leading to multiple documentaries about his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## The "Nuts" Mindset
A recurring theme throughout his career is that "special people are nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. McGregor openly admitted to being "a bit nuts," famously stating, "I'm like Vincent van Gogh, I've lost my mind to the game... Every moment, every thought is about this game. I have lost my mind to it and I wouldn't have it any other way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. This highlights a laser-like focus; he cared about nothing but fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Career and Business Ventures
McGregor's rise led to significant business success beyond fighting. He launched his Proper Twelve whiskey brand, which reportedly sold for $600 million, with McGregor himself earning around $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. He also ventured into a suit line, a FAST program, and a recovery spray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### The Power of "Acting As If"
McGregor demonstrated a philosophy of "acting as if" he already possessed wealth and success. After his first UFC knockout, he famously called out Dana White for the $50,000 bonus, declaring "50 G's baby!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Despite being on welfare the week prior, he immediately spent money on a suit, explaining, "I gotta buy the best, I feel like the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. This approach of elevating his lifestyle, wearing tailored suits to business meetings, and surrounding himself with luxury was perceived as building "the set" for his success, enhancing perception and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. He also rejected the "wanting" mentality, stating, "I already have all these things. I already have the championships. I already have all the money. That's why I walked away, I walked this way, I carry myself this way versus wanting is just pointing out that you don't have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

### Rejecting the Frame
McGregor exhibited a powerful ability to reject external narratives or "frames." In an interview, when asked to say something positive about an opponent, he responded, "This is not a therapy session. I am here to hurt this man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This highlights his strong internal conviction and refusal to be swayed by external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. His mastery of words and ability to create memorable, insightful phrases, such as "Precision beats power and timing beats speed," further demonstrated his intentionality and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## The Impact of Success and "Small Losses"
As McGregor achieved massive success, his mindset reportedly shifted, and he began to experience challenges, including losses in fights and legal troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. The mindset that propelled him to success didn't necessarily sustain him once he reached the pinnacle, as the "matter" (his wealth and fame) grew too large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

He articulated this shift by explaining the difference between commitment *during* training and commitment *outside* training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>:
> "In training I was a hundred percent committed... It was outside the training sessions... I was not a hundred percent committed... those little losses... deteriorate the mind, it weakens the mind and doubt started to creep in for the first time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
These "small losses," like eating forbidden food or not waking up on time, accumulated and weakened his mental fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Insights
McGregor's journey provided several insightful takeaways:
*   **"Slow is smooth and smooth is fast"**: A military phrase tattooed on his arm, signifying that clean, aligned, and smooth actions ultimately lead to greater speed and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **The "Reality Distortion Field"**: Similar to Steve Jobs' concept, McGregor's unwavering belief in his victory, even against overwhelming odds, was a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Choosing your feelings**: "At the end of the day, you got to feel some type of way, so why not feel unbeatable? Why not feel untouchable?" This quote served as a daily reminder for the speaker during stressful entrepreneurial times, emphasizing the choice to adopt empowering feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

## Controversial Opinion on Wealth and Media
The speaker expresses a controversial opinion that claims about McGregor's (and other athletes' like Floyd Mayweather's) earnings from fights, often reported as hundreds of millions or billions, are "100 percent fake and it's absolutely not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. Citing former fighter and analyst Chael Sonnen, it's suggested that these figures are often fabricated for promotion, as official pay-per-view numbers are rarely confirmed by the payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Many public net worth figures found online are deemed "so far off it's laughable" and "completely misleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>, with real earnings often complicated by upfront cash, signing bonuses, salaries, and stock options with varying vesting schedules and fluctuating values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Based on this, the speaker predicts McGregor "will file for bankruptcy" in 10 to 20 years due to the likely exaggeration of his earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

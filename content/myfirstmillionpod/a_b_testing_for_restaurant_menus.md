A/B testing, a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app to see which one performs better, is a common practice for internet companies to optimize user experience and conversion rates. This approach can also be applied to restaurant menus, particularly with the rise of digital menus [00:01:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>).

## The Opportunity

The shift during the pandemic to online menus and QR codes presents a significant opportunity for restaurants to implement A/B testing [00:01:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">00:01:28</a>) [00:01:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">00:01:38</a>). Many internet marketers observe that restaurants are not currently A/B testing their menus [00:00:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">00:00:08</a>) [00:01:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">00:01:42</a>). This gap creates a demand for specialized A/B testing software that restaurants can easily integrate [00:01:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">00:01:49</a>).

## Traditional Menu Design

Even before digital menus, optimizing physical menus was a known strategy to increase revenue. Michelle Banesh, featured in a *Hustle* story, was a professional who redesigned physical menus based on human psychology and eye-tracking patterns (like the "Zed" or "Z effect") [00:02:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">00:02:15</a>) [00:02:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">00:02:32</a>). Her work demonstrated that simply by redesigning a menu, a restaurant could increase its revenue by nine dollars more per customer, without changing any products, but rather the orientation and order of items [00:02:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">00:02:43</a>) [00:02:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">00:02:50</a>).

### Insights from Behavioral Economics
A sushi restaurant startup, which initially operated as a delivery-only "cloud kitchen" more than 10 years ago, experimented with A/B testing their online menu [00:03:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">00:03:57</a>) [00:04:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">00:04:08</a>). They consulted Dan Ariely, author of *Predictably Irrational*, who advised them on pricing [00:04:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">00:04:33</a>).

Ariely suggested that sushi prices were too low, despite the common perception that sushi is expensive [00:05:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">00:05:44</a>). He argued that people associate higher prices with higher quality, similar to the wine industry [00:06:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">00:06:07</a>). When they A/B tested a 50% higher price on one menu version, they observed a higher conversion rate, not just more net money [00:06:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">00:06:13</a>) [00:06:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">00:06:17</a>) [00:06:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">00:06:21</a>). This significantly impacted their margins in an industry known for thin 10% margins [00:06:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">00:06:30</a>) [00:06:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">00:06:35</a>).

They also tested descriptive language, adding phrases like "Alaskan salmon hand caught" or "always fresh, never frozen" to item descriptions. These additions, though factually true, significantly increased purchases [00:06:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">00:06:41</a>) [00:07:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">00:07:09</a>).

## Digital Menu A/B Testing

The digitization of menus via QR codes provides an "inflection point" for easier A/B testing [00:03:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">00:03:00</a>) [00:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">00:08:00</a>). Unlike physical menus where data collection is difficult, digital menus simplify the process [00:08:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">00:08:06</a>).

When customers scan a QR code, they can be directed to different versions of a menu, similar to A/B testing a landing page [00:01:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">00:01:40</a>) [00:02:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">00:22:20</a>) [00:03:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">00:03:00</a>). This allows restaurants to test various elements such as:
*   Menu design and orientation [00:02:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">00:02:53</a>) [00:03:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">00:03:18</a>).
*   Item order [00:02:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">00:02:53</a>).
*   Pricing strategies [00:06:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">00:06:11</a>).
*   Descriptive language for menu items [00:06:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">00:06:41</a>).
*   Visuals and photos [00:09:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>).

Metrics that can be tracked include time spent on different menu versions, scrolling behavior, and ultimately, items sold and average customer value [00:08:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">00:08:39</a>) [00:08:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">00:08:43</a>) [00:03:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">00:03:33</a>).

## Business Opportunities

The need for A/B testing in restaurants opens up several business models:

*   **Software Development:** Create user-friendly A/B testing software specifically for restaurants that can be easily integrated with existing Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, allowing for automated reporting and analytics [00:01:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">00:01:49</a>) [00:03:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">00:03:12</a>) [00:08:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">00:08:27</a>).
*   **Consulting/Agency Model:** Offer services to redesign and A/B test menus, charging a fee or a percentage of the increased revenue [00:07:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">00:07:18</a>). This could involve providing two different physical menu versions and tracking sales to prove which design is more effective [00:07:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">00:07:25</a>). A recurring monthly fee could be charged for continuous testing [00:07:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">00:07:51</a>).

Given that the average restaurant owner may not know how to implement these strategies, a service that promises to increase conversions or average customer value by a specific percentage (e.g., "50% more conversions," "average customer value by three dollars") would be highly appealing [00:03:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">00:03:25</a>) [00:03:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">00:03:30</a>).

## Extension to Delivery Platforms

The concept of menu optimization and A/B testing can also be extended to third-party delivery platforms like DoorDash and Uber Eats [00:09:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">00:09:14</a>). These platforms often feature long menus, which can lead to [[effective_customer_validation_and_product_development | paralysis by analysis]] for customers [00:09:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">00:09:42</a>) [00:09:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">00:09:45</a>).

A service could optimize restaurant listings on these platforms by:
*   Improving photos and descriptions [00:09:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>).
*   Highlighting dietary information (e.g., vegan options) [00:10:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">00:10:40</a>).
*   Curating or trimming menu options to focus on popular items [00:11:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">00:11:07</a>).
*   Developing better copy and taking better photos [00:11:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">00:11:16</a>).

One [[business_copycat_strategy | business model]] explored involved creating "shadow brands" or clones of existing local restaurants on delivery platforms (e.g., "Choo Choo Chinese" for a local Chinese restaurant). These cloned brands would have optimized menus, bright photos, and trimmed offerings, but orders would still be fulfilled by the original restaurant [00:10:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">00:10:49</a>) [00:11:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">00:11:51</a>). This approach could generate 30% extra revenue for the restaurants due to better marketing on these platforms [00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">00:12:00</a>).

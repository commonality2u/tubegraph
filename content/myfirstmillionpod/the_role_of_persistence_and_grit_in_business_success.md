The journey of building a multi-billion dollar company from scratch, without external capital, exemplifies the profound impact of persistence and grit in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The founders, Nick and Matt, began with virtually nothing: no money, no plan, no relationships, and no language skills when they first moved to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This extreme naivety and the challenges they faced underscore their relentless drive.

## Early Lessons in Persistence

The initial phase of their business was characterized by significant challenges and learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:

*   **Learning from failure:** Nick recalls the famous saying that success involves "going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm," which accurately sums up their first ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Door-to-door sales:** Growing up on a dairy farm, they started by selling "kit set" hot air balloons door-to-door at festivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Nick, as the younger brother, served as "free labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This experience taught them invaluable [[the_role_of_hustle_and_creativity_in_entrepreneurship | sales skills]], particularly the ability to handle rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Nick's friend, Fraser, excelled at sales because he "just did not care about being rejected" and would immediately move to the next house after being yelled at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This contrasted with Nick, who needed time to recover after rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This taught him "the power of just persistence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Extreme Frugality:** Living on less than a dollar a day for extended periods in China, they developed a "McBroke diet" where McDonald's was a Christmas treat costing about $2.50 for a combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Nick even devised a trick to get extra free fries by claiming his box was half-empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. They would also use children's concessionary train passes to save a dollar on fares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Building the Toy Empire Against All Odds

Their decision to go to China and build their own factory was born out of extreme naivety, as they didn't know about contract manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. They started with a small shed by a river, spending all their money on an injection molding machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Overcoming Setbacks and Lawsuits:**
    *   Their first product, a hot air balloon, couldn't be sold to major retailers due to not meeting safety standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   They then created a "night frisbee" and a "money gobbler" (a copied product), both leading to lawsuits at their first New York Toy Fair appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. They had no money to defend themselves, so Nick had to learn legal procedures himself, convincing a lawyer (who later got disbarred) to put his name to their self-written defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    *   Nick relentlessly emailed a buyer at Kohl's, Jen, daily, despite her initial protests, eventually securing their first full container order of 20,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This order, however, led to Kohl's being embroiled in their lawsuit, and Jen didn't speak to him for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Ironically, she is now a key contact at Family Dollar, where their company is the second biggest toy supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **The "David Beckham" Breakthrough:** A large order for 2.2 million units of a David Beckham "tamaguchi" toy from Walmart provided their first major break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Despite the order being drastically cut and the product performing poorly, leading to them being blackballed by Walmart for five years, it provided "a little bit of money" to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping and Scrappy Tactics:**
    *   Nick continually "harassed" major retailers like Walmart, calling them "month after month after month" until a buyer finally answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
    *   To get a meeting with Walmart, he had to rent a tiny, expensive showroom in Hong Kong, where he slept under a table on a roll-up mattress and washed in the public bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
    *   He describes his methods as "scrapping every day to try and survive and sell something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. He would "crash buyers' hotels" and "post samples under their hotel room doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
    *   During a critical test sales period for their "night balls" in Cincinnati, Nick admits to "dishonest" but "desperate" actions, giving people cash to buy balls and buying them himself to inflate sales figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. This involved long bus trips between Walmarts and dangerous walks through high-crime neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
    *   When their Robo Fish product faced a factory bankruptcy and an army blockade in China, Nick's brother organized a nighttime raid with eight trucks and their team, bribing guards to retrieve their tooling and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. This daring move ensured continued production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **The Power of Not Giving Up:** The competitive spirit between Nick and his brother meant neither wanted to "admit defeat," pushing each other to "keep fighting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. They believed they had "no other option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Embracing Continuous Improvement and Risk

Despite achieving massive success, the founders maintain their intense drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

*   **Commitment to Profitability:** After losing $200,000 in one month, they vowed "never to have a day, a month, a week, a year" where they would lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This strict adherence to profitability, even if it meant cutting costs or living frugally, allowed them to grow organically without outside capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **"Firing Bullets and Failing Fast":** Their business philosophy involves taking minimal viable investments ("bullets") to test ideas quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. If a "bullet works, it's a cannonball," leading to significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
*   **Speed of Innovation:** They emphasize the importance of "speed of innovation," constantly reinventing their product lines and categories, learning from what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.
*   **"2% Improvement a Week":** They embody a mindset of continuous improvement, believing they "suck now compared to where we'll be in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

## Grit as a Core Value

The founders actively seek "grit density" when hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. They look for competitive individuals with a "bias for action," who can "get shit done" and immediately implement decisions made in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

> "It's not really how capable you are, it's how willing you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>
> "It's the willing people that stick at it for a long consistent period of time and continually improve that actually are the most successful. It's not necessarily about how smart you are; it really is just grit and perseverance, and you end up getting there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>

Their journey illustrates that while talent and ideas are important, [[the_importance_of_persistence_and_selfbelief | unwavering persistence]], resilience in the face of repeated setbacks, and a willingness to learn and adapt are paramount to achieving extraordinary business success. This focus on [[the_role_of_hard_work_and_sacrifice_in_achieving_financial_success | hard work and sacrifice]] and [[overcoming_failure_and_entrepreneurship | overcoming failure]] is a testament to the power of grit.

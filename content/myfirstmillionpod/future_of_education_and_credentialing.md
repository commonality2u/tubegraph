The traditional models of education and credentialing are undergoing significant transformation, driven by technological advancements, particularly in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. This shift promises a future where learning is continuous, credentials are granular and verifiable, and financial incentives align with educational progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:57">[09:51:57]</a>.

## A New Model for Learning and Earning

Current online engagement, particularly on social networks, is often seen as a waste of time, focusing on "status games" and "leaderboards" rather than value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:23">[09:36:23]</a>. A new model, exemplified by platforms like 1729.com, aims to revolutionize this by integrating learning and earning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:57">[10:51:57]</a>.

This model provides "micro tests" or "tasks" through a newsletter format, allowing users to earn cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for completing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:48">[07:44:48]</a>. These tasks are designed not just for earning, but also for building up credentials and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:48">[08:29:48]</a>. The overarching goal is to foster a "less entropic internet" where content strengthens individuals and contributes to a positive future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:15">[20:00:15]</a>.

### Core Philosophy

The guiding philosophy for this new approach to education and societal progress is:
> "Truth, health, and wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:21">[11:01:21]</a>.
This order emphasizes determining what is true, pursuing health (as a foundational element for everything else), and then wealth as a third, important component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:77">[11:04:77]</a>.

## Redefining Credentialing

The traditional college diploma is viewed as a "very coarse-grained" illustration of a person's skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:09">[14:41:09]</a>. It provides a general estimate of a graduate's knowledge but fails to detail specific proficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:50">[14:53:50]</a>.

In contrast, the future of credentialing involves:
*   **[[learn_earn_legacy_framework_for_career_development | Crypto credentials]] and badges**: These are digital tokens stored in a crypto wallet that reflect specific skills and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:46">[14:11:46]</a>. For example, completing five Python problems earns a Python badge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:05">[14:21:05]</a>.
*   **Granularization of skills**: This system allows for individual, measurable skills to be tracked and verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:07">[14:48:07]</a>. A portfolio, similar to a GitHub repository, could showcase every problem solved in a course, demonstrating specific expertise (e.g., operating systems, compilers, machine learning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:18">[15:08:18]</a>.
*   **Portable digital diplomas**: These crypto credentials would allow individuals to "log into a job board and just start working" because their qualifications are automatically verifiable based on their accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:13">[16:14:13]</a>. This moves beyond self-declared interests to provable declarations of knowledge and ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:19">[16:20:19]</a>.

This system aims to solve the "unreliable narrator problem" often encountered in hiring, where candidates might overstate their skills on a CV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:59">[16:40:59]</a>.

## Decentralized Science and Reproducible Research

The concept of "truth" itself is being redefined, moving away from corporate media as the sole source. Cryptography, particularly blockchain technology, offers "decentralized truth" â€“ mathematical truth accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:08">[40:07:08]</a>.

This extends to science through:
*   **Crypto Oracles**: These act as sensors or data providers that broadcast verifiable data onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:81">[42:44:81]</a>. This includes non-financial data like temperature feeds for insurance contracts or medical records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:39">[43:50:39]</a>.
*   **Ledger of Record**: The integration of various crypto oracles creates a comprehensive, cryptographically verifiable digital history of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:20">[44:22:20]</a>. This allows for transparent, unalterable records of events and assertions, moving beyond siloed data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49:57">[44:49:57]</a>.
*   **Redefining Science**: True science is based on "independent replication," not just peer review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:32">[02:11:32]</a>. While physical experiments are impractical for everyone to replicate, digital science (based on code and data) can be mathematically verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>. If the underlying data and code for scientific papers are on-chain, anyone with a computer can independently check calculations, figures, tables, and even the chain of citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. This makes science "far more checkable and cumulative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:03">[02:19:03]</a>.

## Impact on Hiring and Skill Development

The shift in credentialing also impacts hiring practices. Instead of relying solely on diplomas from traditional universities, hiring can be based on demonstrable skills and character observed through platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>. The ability to write, demonstrate interests, and showcase values becomes more significant than a university degree, especially as traditional higher education institutions are perceived as prioritizing "religious education" over technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:19">[02:28:19]</a>.

Foundational skills for the future, especially for someone starting today, include a deep understanding of computer science and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. These are considered universal languages, applicable across various domains from finance (via crypto) to genomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:08">[02:11:08]</a>. The world is becoming more "constructed virtual," making these skills even more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

The market for video generation is considered "very deep," with potential for a billion dollars in revenue within the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This emerging field allows for the creation of video content without traditional filming or editing, transforming the process of content creation for various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## AI as the "New Drop Shipping"

AI, particularly advanced models like those from OpenAI, is likened to the "new Drop Shipping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Just as Drop Shipping enabled entrepreneurs to sell products without managing inventory or shipping, AI allows users to generate content (like video from text) without having to "make" the product themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The focus shifts to the marketing and distribution of these AI-generated services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This approach makes it possible for individuals or small teams to generate significant cash flow without being "deep AI people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Examples of AI Video Generation Applications

### HeyGen: Video Avatars for Business
HeyGen is a company that enables users to create a video avatar of themselves that is indistinguishable from a real person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This technology has achieved a high bar of quality, emerging in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

It serves various corporate use cases, including:
*   Training videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   Introductory videos for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Internal training systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>
*   Content creation for creators, SMBs, and high-end enterprise advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>

HeyGen has achieved tens of millions in revenue without any paid marketing, driven by the unique quality of its content and user sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. It rapidly reached $20 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The platform is considered "production ready," distinguishing itself from "cool demos" that lack real-world usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Recent advancements even allow avatars to perform actions like walking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. For safety, creating a personal avatar requires recording oneself saying specific words to confirm consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### AI for E-commerce and Marketing
[[ai_in_ecommerce_and_marketing | AI is transforming e-commerce and marketing]] through advanced video generation for product ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

*   **Icon.me** allows real influencers to create digital twins that can generate user-generated content (UGC) style ads. A brand can provide a script and product, and the AI will generate a video featuring the influencer's digital twin holding an AI-generated product, eliminating the need for the influencer to physically interact with the product or record the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Arcades** employs entirely fake AI actors to promote products. These AI-generated individuals look like real people in their homes providing genuine endorsements, making it very simple to create authentic-looking advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

These types of businesses can quickly reach mid-seven figures in revenue due to the "wow" factor of their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Other Visual Content Applications
Open-source models can be fine-tuned for various commercial visual content applications:
*   **Renderings for interior design or buildings**: AI can generate realistic renderings from floor plans, which previously cost thousands of dollars, making them available at a very low incremental cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   **AI headshot companies (e.g., Aragon.ai)**: These services generate professional headshots from user-provided photos, eliminating the need for a physical studio or photographer. This represents a "Drop Shipping" model for services, allowing for profitable marketing funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Business Opportunity: Distribution and Ideas
The current landscape presents an "amazing time" for individuals skilled in distribution, marketing, and idea generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The ability to identify problems and apply basic AI capabilities to create solutions is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Companies like Jasper, started by internet marketers rather than AI researchers, leveraged their distribution skills to rapidly scale by applying AI models to solve specific marketing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Software 3.0
The concept of "Software 3.0" suggests that the next generation of software development will heavily involve manipulating "Foundation models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. These models possess extensive capabilities "out of the box," meaning they don't need to be trained from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. Developers will focus on providing guidance, reinforcement, and business-specific information to tailor these models to various use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. This approach makes powerful AI applications more accessible for a wide range of niches, even those considered small by research labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

[[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities | This era offers significant opportunities for entrepreneurs]] to build businesses by focusing on the "last mile" application of these foundational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

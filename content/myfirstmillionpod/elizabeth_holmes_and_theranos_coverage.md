The topic of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos was discussed following her conviction for crimes related to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Elizabeth Holmes' Conviction
Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of three or four crimes and could face up to 20 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Specific counts could carry sentences up to 20 years, with another carrying up to five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## The Speaker's Initial Stance
The speaker had an article published on the front page of Hacker News that he wrote in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The article's headline was "The coverage of Theranos is utter [\h__\h]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In the article, the speaker referred to the issues surrounding Theranos as a "minor PR hiccup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He wrote it when he was about 24 or 25 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The article was written after initial accusations and "hating" on Holmes began, contrasting with the extensive positive media coverage she had received in the years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While appearing to defend Holmes on the surface, the core point of the article was to criticize the media cycle of building people up and then tearing them down, often for superficial reasons like how they look or talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Rationale for Defense
A key reason the speaker initially supported Theranos was because [[investing_in_tech_startups | Tim Draper]] was their biggest backer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. [[investing_in_tech_startups | Tim Draper]] is known as a high-integrity, honest person and was an early investor in companies like [[insights_into_elon_musks_risk_management_and_decisionmaking | SpaceX]] and Hotmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The speaker believed that [[investing_in_tech_statups | Tim Draper]] would not be tricked by such a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "it's expected that a young company that's attempting to change a massive and archaic industry will mess up. It appears that Theranos made a bunch of mistakes and I'm not defending their actions I'm also not saying that the media shouldn't point out the truths about Theranos's mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

The article acknowledged that the "cycle kind of flipped" on Holmes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Retrospection and Lessons Learned
The speaker admitted that his article "did not age well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> and that he was "so wrong about her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He kept the article public, stating, "if I'm gonna take swings I gotta let people see the misses too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. He reflected that his "guard was up" due to many unfair "hit pieces" on founders, which led him to not recognize when the criticism was actually warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He felt "fooled" by Elizabeth Holmes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

In the entrepreneurial journey, particularly when aiming to [[building_a_successful_startup | build a successful startup]] or business, a key strategy to "win even when you lose" is to continuously develop your personal [[aligning_skills_for_entrepreneurial_success | skill stack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Even if specific startups fail, the skills you acquire will certainly succeed and contribute to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. There are three master skills crucial for this path: learning to build, learning to sell, and [[creating_and_leveraging_luck_through_content_and_networking | learning to get lucky]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

## Learning to Build

The first master skill is learning to make things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This doesn't necessarily mean physical construction but can encompass various forms of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

Types of Building:
*   **Physical Construction**: Engineering, robotics, or building things with your hands, such as rockets or cars (Elon Musk type endeavors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Code**: Learning to program and build digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   **Design**: Becoming proficient as a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   **Content Creation**: Learning to create podcasts, YouTube channels, or other forms of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

To develop this skill, you should pick something you are most drawn to and believe you would have the energy to do even when tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Consistent practice, hundreds of times, is essential to become proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

## Learning to Sell

The second master skill is [[building_and_selling_successful_businesses | learning to sell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. This skill involves getting the products or services you've made into the hands of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

Methods for Selling:
*   **Digital Marketing**: Learning Facebook ads, Google ads, TikTok ads, or other digital advertising platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**: Writing blog posts that educate and subtly lead to product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   **Direct Sales**: In-person selling, phone selling, or cold emailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Copywriting**: Developing the ability to use words that persuade people to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Newsletter Writing**: Crafting engaging newsletters that can also serve as a sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

Even if initial startups fail, constantly practicing these sales skills will lead to incremental improvement, enabling you to execute effectively when a good idea emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Learning to Get Lucky

The third skill is [[impact_of_luck_and_preparation_in_business_success | learning to get lucky]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Luck is not just random chance; it is a skill that can be developed through intentional actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

There are four types of luck:

### 1. Blind Luck
This is pure chance, like getting struck by lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. It happens, but it cannot be influenced or relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

### 2. Motion Luck
Often summarized as "fortune favors the bold," this type of luck comes from doing a significant amount of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. By engaging in more actions, even if not perfectly efficient, you increase your surface area for opportunities and thus your chances of getting lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### 3. Spotting Luck
This refers to having a "prepared mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. An example is a stock analyst who recognizes a valuable report others ignore because they know what they're looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. You develop spotting luck by doing so many things that you can recognize an outlier or a remarkable opportunity when it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. For instance, after 100 bad dates, you're prepared to recognize and seize the chance with a remarkable person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

### 4. Reputational Luck
Luck acts like a magnet in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. If you have a strong reputation, for example, as the world's best deep-sea diver, you will be the first person called when a sunken treasure is discovered, regardless of its location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. Creating content online is valuable for building this type of luck because it establishes your reputation, leading others to think of you and creating opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

By developing these three core skills—learning to build, sell, and get lucky—individuals can significantly increase their odds of [[leveraging_skills_and_personal_development_for_business_success | entrepreneurial success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

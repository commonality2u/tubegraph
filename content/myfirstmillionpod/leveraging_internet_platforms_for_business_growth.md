The internet has opened unprecedented [[opportunities_in_current_digital_platforms | opportunities in current digital platforms]] for individuals and small teams to build highly profitable businesses, often with only one or two employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These "mighty businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> can generate millions in revenue while flying under the radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The core drivers are typically one or two individuals, possibly leveraging contractors, vendors, or agencies for other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Key Strategies and Lessons for Leveraging Internet Platforms

These successes illustrate several core principles:

*   **Niche Focus and Authority**: Building an authority in a super-niche topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. By providing free content, you establish yourself as an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Distribution vs. Product Mastery**: Success often comes from being either exceptionally good at distribution (influencer, content creator) or at product development (coding games, plugins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. Focus all your emphasis on one of these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: Since labor is limited, successful solo/duopreneurs utilize leverage from code, media, or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.
    *   **Code**: Building software once that can run and serve many users (e.g., Stardew Valley, Photopea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.
    *   **Media**: Creating content that can reach a large audience repeatedly (e.g., podcasts, newsletters, social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.
    *   **Capital**: Investing to acquire assets or scale operations (e.g., buying ads, funding development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Identifying and entering emerging markets or platforms (e.g., OnlyFans growth, Clubhouse, Facebook Threads) early can provide a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This involves "paddling out" and being ready to "surf the wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **Technical Skill/Expertise**: A high level of skill in areas like copywriting, design, coding, or market analysis is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations

*   **Demand/Burnout**: Rapid growth can lead to immense pressure and exhaustion, as seen with the creator of Viral Nova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> and the early Twitter team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Loneliness**: The entrepreneurial journey can be isolating when working alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. Having a co-founder or a small team (two people is often considered a sweet spot) provides accountability, a thought partner, and makes the journey more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Some successful products are under-monetized, highlighting that gaining traffic and building a valuable product can be harder than figuring out revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

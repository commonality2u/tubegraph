## The Host's Transformative Experience
The podcast host describes his personal [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle|transformation]] after attending a [[lessons_from_tony_robbins_and_selfimprovement|Tony Robbins]] event eight years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He still keeps his notebook from the event because it "changed his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He emerged a "different guy" and a "happier guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. After the event, he developed a plan and strategy for his podcast, "My First Million," and stuck to it, making three specific shifts that led to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He plans to have [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony Robbins]] explain these same shifts on the podcast, likening it to a free [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|live coaching session]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Upon attending, the host initially planned to observe passively but found himself fully engaged within 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He noticed celebrities and successful individuals, including Gerard Butler and Vanessa Hudgens, participating actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Another attendee, who had been to five events, compared [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals|Tony Robbins]] to "the Michael Jordan of public speaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Tony Robbins' Origin Story and Philosophy
[[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals|Tony Robbins]] himself attributes his start in [[personal_development_and_growth|personal development]] to a "rough background" with no money for food and working two jobs as a janitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. At 17, a friend of his father, who had transformed from a "loser" to being "really successful," invited him to a seminar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The friend insisted that [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony]] pay the $35 fee (equivalent to $250 today, or a week's pay for Tony) because "if you don't pay for it, you won't value it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Tony heard Jim Rohn speak, which "deeply moved" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. He then immersed himself in [[personal_development_and_growth|human development]], discovering Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. He practiced using NLP to change human emotion and behavior, even offering to help strangers at a Denny's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He challenged traditional therapists, claiming he could resolve lifetime phobias in an hour, which built his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This led to coaching athletes and eventually world leaders like Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, and Bill Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Core Teachings and Practices
[[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony Robbins]] emphasizes several principles that contribute to [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle|personal transformation]]:

*   **Valuable Self-Improvement**: Inspired by Jim Rohn, Tony learned to "work harder on yourself than you do on your job" and "add more value than anybody else in the marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This principle has been the foundation for all his companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Immersion and Repetition**: Tony believes in "immersion" for learning, which is why his events are 12 hours a day for three or four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. He engages people through all their senses, making time fly even during long sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He models the best in the world, even working as a janitor in early days to be around successful people and learn their mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. He likens continuous practice to Steph Curry taking hundreds of thousands of practice shots, noting, "you're rewarded in public for what you practice in private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **"Honey, I'm Home" Energy**: [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony]] taught the host the importance of bringing a high-energy state home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. This ritual, where Tony and his wife greet each other with enthusiasm, maintains "aliveness and passion" in their 24-year relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. It's crucial to train oneself to be in a peak state at home to produce peak results and avoid letting external pressures diminish one's internal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **The 90-Second Rule for Suffering**: [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony]] practices and teaches snapping out of suffering within 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. This doesn't mean avoiding negative emotions but training to quickly shift out of them, like a skill that improves with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This enables finding "beauty" in any situation and arriving at solutions faster than in a negative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Proximity is Power**: A valuable principle [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony]] learned from Peter Guber and his friends is that "proximity is power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This means actively seeking out and spending time with the best people in one's desired field, adding value, and allowing opportunities to arise from these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Tony's own experience with a $50 million deal and later a $400 million public offering stemmed from deliberately applying this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## [[tony_robbins_on_giving_and_philanthropy|Giving and Philanthropy]]
[[tony_robbins_on_giving_and_philanthropy|Tony Robbins]] believes in the transformative power of giving. He stated, "If you won't give a dime out of a dollar, you're not going to give 10 million out of 100 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The value of giving helps individuals overcome scarcity mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

Tony shared a personal story of being broke at 24, with only $19-22 left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. After eating at a salad bar, he was moved by a little boy politely treating his mother to lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. With no plan, Tony spontaneously gave the boy all his remaining money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. He felt "high as a kite" and "full" despite having no money left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. The next morning, he received a $1,200 repayment from a friend he had loaned money to years before, which was more than enough to live on for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

This experience taught him that "when I had nothing, I gave everything, and here this is what does this mean... because I didn't give to get and I didn't give what was easy that's why I'm receiving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. From that day on, he never felt scarcity again, realizing that if one can give when there's nothing, the brain understands there's "more than enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. He cited Sir John Templeton, who stated the secret to wealth is gratitude and that he never met anyone who tithed for at least 10 years who didn't become wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. [[tony_robbins_on_giving_and_philanthropy|Tony]] proudly mentioned he has given away 17% of his earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Opportunities for Transformation
[[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony Robbins]] offers a free online seminar called the "Time to Rise Summit" for three days each year, designed to help participants create a plan and make necessary changes in their energy, emotions, business, finances, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. Last year, over a million people from 195 countries attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.

The host of the podcast, inspired by his own [[lessons_from_tony_robbins_and_selfimprovement|transformation]], has gifted tickets to [[tony_robbins_coaching_method_and_philosophy|Tony Robbins']] events to 44 people over the years, including his parents and other entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He notes that while 15% experience a complete [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle|transformation]], 70% have a "great experience," and 15% don't fully connect with the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. The host encourages people to attend and "decide for yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. In a show of generosity, [[tony_robbins_on_giving_and_philanthropy|Tony Robbins]] agreed to match the host's offer to send 40 additional listeners to his "UPW" event, making it 80 free tickets in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

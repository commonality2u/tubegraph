Many aspiring individuals wonder how to achieve success if they were starting over from scratch, often specifying an age like 21 or 25. While the question appears to be about wealth and achievement, the age component reflects a desire for the hope and possibilities associated with youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, success is not constrained by chronological age; if one is not successful, it is "day one" regardless of how old they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Embracing the Mindset of Youth

The core takeaway is to always maintain a "21-year-old mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This means cultivating the belief that:
*   The entire world is still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The best days are yet to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Anything is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   One can [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle | reinvent themselves]] at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Freedom from Age Constraints

Adopting this mindset helps to free oneself from the pressure, doubt, and anxiety that age constraints can impose, which are unhelpful for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For instance, experiencing an "existential crisis" at 29 years old due to unmet expectations (e.g., Forbes 30 Under 30, a million dollars in the bank) can be overcome by simply moving on and focusing on playing offense rather than feeling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> "The first thing to do is to free yourself of the time constraint, the age constraint, which only adds pressure and doubt and anxiety to the equation, which none of that helps you be successful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

## Relevance in the "Learn Phase" of Career

This mindset is particularly crucial during the "learn phase" of a career, which typically spans the first ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Instead of being pigeonholed by early decisions like a college major, this phase is about "dating around" with different experiences to discover unique capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Dabbling and Reinvention
It's advised to expect to "reinvent yourself and hop into a new situation" every 18 months to continuously challenge oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This constant change is not about being indecisive but about finding one's unique strengths and passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Embracing "Loser's Edge"
A key aspect of this mindset is to embrace the "loser's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>:
*   **Being small and helpless**: People are often willing to help beginners, providing opportunities to shadow or ride along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Hiding embarrassment about being a beginner means throwing away this advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Having time**: With a clear calendar, one can pursue opportunities that busy, more successful individuals cannot or will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Nothing to lose**: Starting at rock bottom provides a solid foundation for taking more risks than those who have established reputations or assets to protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This [[the_philosophy_of_seizing_opportunities | allows for taking more risks]] because there's everything to gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## The Foundation of Action
Ultimately, the actions taken in life are downstream of one's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. By cultivating this youthful, optimistic, and adaptable mindset, one can inherently arrive at the correct actions for success, rather than needing to be told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

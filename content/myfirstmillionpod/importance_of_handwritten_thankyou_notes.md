Jesse Itzler, a successful entrepreneur and ultramarathoner, emphasizes the profound impact of handwritten thank-you notes as a core practice for personal and professional growth. He describes this method as an essential part of his end-of-year review process, allowing him to enter the new year feeling "light" and prepared to "attack" his goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>

## Why Handwritten Notes Matter
Itzler champions handwritten letters for several compelling reasons:

*   **Breaks Through Clutter**
    In an age dominated by digital communication, a physical letter stands out. People remember receiving handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> and are more likely to read their physical mail compared to DMs, texts, or Slacks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   **Demonstrates Intention and Effort**
    The act of writing a letter, licking the envelope, and mailing it conveys a unique level of care and "love" that differs significantly from simply hitting "send" on an email. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
*   **Cannot Outsource Soul**
    Itzler believes that the "soul" or "heartbeat" of a business or personal connection cannot be outsourced. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> When tasks traditionally done personally are delegated, something is lost, and customers or friends can sense this. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   **High Return on Investment**
    Spending a small amount of time writing notes can yield significant positive returns. Itzler encourages an experiment: write 10 thank-you notes in 20 minutes to experience the "return on investment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> People who receive such letters will remember and respond positively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>

## Practical Application
Jesse Itzler's approach to handwritten notes is deeply ingrained in his life:

*   **Annual Practice**
    Every year, Itzler writes handwritten letters to 20 to 30 people who significantly impacted or helped him, including podcast hosts, suppliers, contractors, teachers, and coaches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> The sole purpose is to express gratitude. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **A Marketing Strategy from His Twenties**
    When he was 23, with no money and sleeping on couches, Itzler's entire marketing strategy revolved around writing 10 handwritten letters a day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> He wrote approximately 3,000 letters and continues this practice to this day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
*   **Keeping Records**
    Itzler saves all the letters he receives in a dedicated box, starting a new one each year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> This practice serves as a tangible reminder of connections and appreciation.

## Notable Examples
The power of handwritten notes is not unique to Itzler:

*   **Warren Buffett**
    Value investor Guy Spier was inspired to start writing letters after receiving a brief, handwritten thank-you note from Warren Buffett after attending a Berkshire Hathaway Summit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
*   **Coach K**
    Jesse Itzler also receives an annual letter from Coach K, a testament to the enduring impact of this personal touch. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

By engaging in this simple yet powerful act of gratitude, individuals can cultivate stronger relationships and foster a more meaningful sense of accomplishment.

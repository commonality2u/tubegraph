[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]], a seasoned investor, has dedicated 25 years to studying the strategies of investment greats like [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] and [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffetts influence | Charlie Munger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He views [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]] as commanding "an army of capital" to work for you, rather than working for money yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Learning from the Greats

To become proficient in [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]], [[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] emphasizes the importance of studying successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He meticulously read every annual letter and report from [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffetts influence | Warren Buffett]] and others, learning how they built their wealth "bit by bit, block by block, step by step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He didn't just learn from books; he practiced the principles he discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Posy Group: A Collaborative Approach to Investing

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] was part of an investment study group in New York City called "The Posy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This group, comprised of five or six individuals fascinated by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]] and aspiring to become better investors, would meet regularly, sometimes weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Key members included Whitney Tilson, an exceptional networker, and for a period, Bill Ackman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The group's commonality was their interest in the Buffett-style of [[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | value investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Meetings were structured, with one person presenting a written stock idea for in-depth discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This led to follow-up meetings, company visits (like to ISWI, Interactive Services Worldwide Inc.), and sharing of notes and insights from conference calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

A significant benefit was the "unstructured" meta-information gained, where a casual mention could spark a fascinating idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For example, Bill Ackman's discussion of MBIA and the asymmetry of credit default swaps left a lasting impression on Spear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### The Farmer Mac Story: A Lesson in Due Diligence

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]], initially investing for "friends, fools, and family," was very cautious as he felt he didn't fully know what he was doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. His approach was to reverse-engineer successful investors like [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]] and Tom Russo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Inspired by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]]'s investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (government-sponsored enterprises in the mortgage market), Spear sought similar opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He found Farmer Mac, a similar entity focused on farm loans, which appeared highly profitable and poised for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He presented this idea to The Posy group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

However, Whitney Tilson informed him that Bill Ackman was taking a massive short position in Farmer Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Ackman believed the company was "borderline fraudulent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Spear visited Ackman's office, where he saw extensive files of public filings that Ackman had downloaded and analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Ackman pointed out that unlike Freddie and Fannie's mortgage-backed securities, which contained thousands of diverse individual mortgages, Farmer Mac's often contained only a few large, business-related loans, not truly diversified real estate mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Spear realized he hadn't done the necessary in-depth analysis himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Convinced by Ackman's arguments, he immediately sold his Farmer Mac shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Later, a meeting between Ackman and Farmer Mac management revealed the company's inability to provide good answers to Ackman's pointed questions, reinforcing Spear's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This experience highlighted the importance of thorough analysis, especially when exploring less-trodden investment paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Insights from Warren Buffett's Investment Philosophy

### Reverse Engineering Success

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]]'s early approach to [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]] involved looking for people who knew what they were doing and trying to "unwind what they did to backfill to reverse engineer what they'd done and do the same thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### The "Drowning in Cash" Concept

By ordering and studying annual reports of companies [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]] had invested in, such as Coca-Cola, Spear discovered businesses that "drown in cash," generating enormous amounts of money far beyond what was immediately apparent on their income statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. This was a profound eye-opener, showing him the kind of extraordinary outliers [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]] sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

### Modeling and Hypothetical Mentors

A core insight for Spear was the ability to learn from mentors, even if they aren't physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. He often asked himself: "If [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]] was here right now, if he was in my shoes, what would he do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. This mental exercise, which [[Tony Robbins new book and investment strategies | Tony Robbins]] might call a "technology of success," is a powerful way to guide actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. This modeling behavior is deeply human, akin to how children learn from parents or hunters from elders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

### The Two Gas Stations Metaphor

Spear recounts the "two gas stations" story from Jim Collins's *Good to Great* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. Two gas stations across the street, one successful, the other not. The successful one consistently takes small, beneficial actions like painting the wall, adding flowers, or slightly lowering prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. The key is that the unsuccessful owner sees these actions but doesn't copy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Spear realized he himself was often "the guy on the other side of the road," failing to implement simple, effective strategies observed from successful people like Monish Pabrai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. This highlights the importance of not just observing success, but actively copying and implementing actionable steps, such as building "engines" for goodwill or client acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

### The Power of Handwritten Notes and Genuine Connection

Inspired by Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and also by the example of a successful car salesperson described in a Cialdini book, [[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] committed to writing thousands of "thank you" notes, often three per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. This disciplined practice, initially feeling "weird" and somewhat inauthentic, gradually transformed him into a more caring and interested person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. He learned that sometimes, "you don't have to feel it to do it; do it and you'll feel it later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

This commitment reflects the concept of the Reticular Activating System (RAS) from [[Tony Robbins new book and investment strategies | Tony Robbins]], where directing your brain to look for specific things (like reasons to be grateful or things to appreciate in others) trains it to notice and embody those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

Even [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]] practices this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Spear proudly displays a holiday card from [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]] (from 2011) that is personalized with a handwritten note saying, "Guy, happy holidays, I enjoyed your 2010 report. Warren" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. This small, personal gesture from a titan like [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]] demonstrates a profound understanding of reciprocity and building goodwill, even for someone as seemingly insignificant to him as Spear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

Kobe Bryant also exemplified this by remembering small details about people and making personal calls, understanding that a few seconds of genuine connection could create a lifelong fan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Psychology

### Investing as a Defensive Game

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] uses a bowling analogy to describe [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]]: it's not about always hitting the bullseye, but about avoiding the gutters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. He emphasizes protecting against massive losses, rather than solely aiming for big winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

### Avoiding the "Lottery Winner" Fallacy

Inspired by [[stories of successful investors and unique investment philosophies | Nassim Taleb]]'s concept of "Fooled by Randomness," Spear cautions against studying only highly successful individuals or companies (like Google or Jeff Bezos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Many of them may be "lottery winners," succeeding due to luck or being in the right place at the right time, rather than solely by replicable attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. Even lottery winners often subjectively believe their input contributed to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. The focus should be on setting up one's life and [[wealth building and management strategies | investment strategies]] to succeed well enough, regardless of enormous randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

### The Infinite Game of Investing

Drawing from the concept of "infinite games," Spear explains that most important aspects of life, including [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]], are infinite games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Unlike finite games (like chess or football) with clear rules, spaces, and winners/losers, infinite games have no clearly defined rules, boundaries, or end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. In an infinite game, players don't "win" or "lose"; they simply decide to drop out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. The key mistake people make is treating an infinite game as if it were a finite one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. In [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]], the goal is to keep playing, compounding wealth, and managing risk to avoid implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

### Behavioral Reinforcement through Investment Choices

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] owns about 20% of Berkshire Hathaway B shares in his fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. He argues that while one could invest in an impersonal index, owning Berkshire Hathaway and attending its annual meeting fosters a deeper connection to the company, making investors more likely to stay in for the long haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. He believes it's crucial to consider how an asset affects one's own behavior and internal wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Shorting Farmer Mac, for instance, made him feel "twisted inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway, by contrast, strengthens his internal wiring positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

### Managing Psychology During Underperformance

Despite beating the S&P 500 over 25 years, Spear's fund has underperformed the index for the last 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He manages his psychology by focusing on the core understanding of his [[investment strategies and experiences | investing]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. He prioritizes "compounding" over merely "beating the index," knowing that his strategy, even in worst-case scenarios, should lead to a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Aspiring Investors

[[Guy Spears approach to value investing and Warren Buffetts influence | Guy Spear]] offers several pieces of advice:

*   **Go to the Source**: For those new to the [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Buffett]]-[[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Munger]] school of thought, he recommends reading [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Buffett]]'s annual letters and listening to recordings of Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. He also highly recommends [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Poor Charlie's Almanac]] as an incredible collection of [[the influence of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett | Munger]]'s insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
*   **Iterate Quickly with Reading**: Don't feel obligated to finish every book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. Pick up 20 books, skim them, and if a book isn't immediately resonating or giving you "win after win," put it down and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Treat your library like a cocktail party, hopping from one conversation to another if it gets boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   **The "What Would X Do?" Question**: A powerful tool is to imagine a respected mentor (like [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]]) in your shoes and ask what they would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.
*   **The "Contemplated Action" Rule**: Before taking an action, ask yourself: "If I did this action every time I was in this circumstance, how would my life look?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. Similarly, "If everybody in the world did this contemplated thing... what would the world look like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. This simplifies thousands of future decisions and helps align actions with long-term goals and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

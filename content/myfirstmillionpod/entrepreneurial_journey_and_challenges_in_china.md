The entrepreneurial path to building a multi-billion dollar company often starts with seemingly "insane" decisions, as was the case for the founder, who embarked on his journey to China with no money, no plan, no relationships, and no language skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. What began with sleeping in a bush eventually transformed into a business empire generating over two billion US dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Bold Move to China

The decision to move to China was a "crazy rash decision" driven by a desire to manufacture hot air balloons more professionally after an initial success selling them door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. The founder's brother, Matt, initially explored India and China, then suggested the founder go to China alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. He dropped out of his second year of law school, brought a friend named Joe, and headed to Shantou, China, a remote location with no other Westerners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

Their initial arrival was fraught with challenges:
*   **No Money, No Contacts:** They had "no money really, no contacts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Sleeping in a Bush:** The first night involved sleeping in the bushes at Hong Kong airport due to expensive hotels, leading to mosquito attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
*   **Primitive Living Conditions:** Their apartment in Shantou cost only about $8 a month but was on the eighth floor with no lift, requiring long walks for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Their primary plan was to build their own factory, not realizing contract manufacturing was an option, which highlights their extreme naivety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. They established a small shed factory by a river, buying an injection molding machine with all their money and employing a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Early Business Struggles and Naivety

The early years were characterized by constant [[overcoming_entrepreneurial_challenges | challenges]] and a steep [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | learning curve]]:

*   **"McBroke Diet":** Living on less than a dollar a day was standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. McDonald's was a Christmas treat, and they'd employ tricks like complaining about half-full fries to get more for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. They even used children's train passes to save a dollar on fares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Product Development and Legal Issues:**
    *   Their initial hot air balloon product couldn't be sold to major retailers due to lacking regulatory standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
    *   They then copied a light-up frisbee and a money bank, leading to immediate lawsuits at their first New York Toy Fair appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
    *   They had no money to defend themselves, even recruiting a disbarred lawyer to help them navigate the legal process cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Sales and Distribution:**
    *   The founder relentlessly emailed buyers, eventually securing a major order for the night frisbee from Kohl's, only for Kohl's to also be enjoined in the lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
    *   They scraped every day to survive, constantly seeking new customers as early products didn't generate reorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Product Quality Issues:** Their own manufactured products, like the "night balls," were of poor quality, often half-mangled, but they still shipped them out of desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. This led them to realize their strength was in sales and distribution rather than innovative product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.

## Persistence and Breakthroughs

Despite the challenges, the brothers' competitive nature and refusal to admit defeat fueled their persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

> "Success is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>

*   **Securing a Showroom:** Realizing the toy industry revolved around showrooms in Hong Kong, they rented a tiny, expensive glass cubicle, where the founder slept under a table to save money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **First Big Order:** Their persistent pursuit of Walmart, including contacting the buyer daily, led to a meeting. Despite a rocky start and a rude encounter with a Walmart Canada buyer, the founder's persistence led to a $70,000 order for a night ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.
*   **The David Beckham Tamaguchi Deal:** A major turning point came with a $30 million order from Walmart for a David Beckham Tamaguchi product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. This forced them to engage with a large contract manufacturer, Early Light International, which also helped them with financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.
*   **Factory Crisis and Recovery:** Mid-production of the David Beckham toy, the factory they were bound to use went bankrupt, and the Chinese army sealed it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. In a daring midnight operation, the founder's brother, Matt, led a team with eight trucks, paid bribes, and retrieved all their tooling and equipment to relocate to a new factory, ensuring continued production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>. This dramatic incident, despite resulting in being blackballed by Walmart for five years, was their "first break to actually make a little bit of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Shift to Licensing:** Recognizing their strength in distribution over internal design, they began partnering with US companies to sell their products internationally. This led to successful brands like Zies and Schnooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>.
*   **Robo Fish and Market Dominance:** A major breakthrough was Robo Fish, a water-activated robotic fish licensed from a Chinese inventor, which became a global bestseller, reaching $100 million in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. This product brought significant momentum and opened doors with retailers who had previously ignored them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Company Philosophy

The [[early_business_experiences_and_challenges | early challenges]] in China forged a unique business model and philosophy:

*   **Organic Growth and Frugality:** After losing $200,000 in one month, they vowed to be profitable every day, week, month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. This strict frugality and commitment to profitability enabled them to grow organically without outside capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **"First Principles" Approach:** Their naive beginnings led them to build their business from "first principles," particularly in factory setup, automation, and centralized global marketing, differing from industry norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>.
*   **"Firing Bullets and Failing Fast":** Their current business philosophy emphasizes making "minimal viable investments" ("bullets") to test ideas quickly. If a bullet works, it becomes a "cannonball" for larger investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** They instill a "2% Improvement a week" mindset, driving relentless self-improvement and acknowledging that "we suck now compared to where we'll be in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Grit:** The company prioritizes hiring individuals with "grit, smarts, and a bias for action," seeking competitive people who love to win and act quickly on decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

The resilience and innovative approach forged in China during their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurial journey]] allowed them to not only succeed in toys but also expand into new verticals like diapers and beauty, building fully automated factories and highly efficient global distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Their story serves as an [[entrepreneur_success_stories | entrepreneur success story]] demonstrating the power of persistence and adaptability in the face of extreme adversity.

Peter Levels, known as levels.io on Twitter, is recognized for his [[Unconventional life choices and experiments | unconventional lifestyle]] centered around digital nomadism and building small, automated businesses. His approach challenges traditional notions of work, home, and possessions, emphasizing freedom and intentional living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## The Digital Nomad "Red Pill" Philosophy

Peter's philosophy, likened to taking the "red pill" from The Matrix, suggests that the traditional way of living – choosing one place to reside, going to an office daily, and adhering to conventional routines – is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:44">[13:23:44]</a>. Instead, he advocates for a life where one travels, lives in different places, wears flip-flops, and carries only a backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. This perspective became his core "truth" around which he built his personal brand and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

He believes that a unique life emerges from meeting diverse people and experiencing different places, which also provides inspiration for creating products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## Journey to Nomadism and Business Evolution

Peter began his nomadic journey around 2014, moving almost every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. He started building small apps and websites to validate ideas while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. His inspiration came from people like Patrick McKenzie (patio11) on Hacker News, who shared revenue from small, indie products, demonstrating that one could build businesses without needing large VC funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

He documented his experiences through blogging, initially for his mother, but found that his posts on Hacker News about [[Adventurous business ventures | bootstrapping startups]] as a nomad resonated with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:07]</a>. In 2013-2014, when remote work and nomadism were not mainstream, he aimed to make the lifestyle more reputable, moving away from what he perceived as "shady" aspects of the early nomad scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

While Peter's growth might seem like an "overnight success," it was a "10-year overnight success," building momentum and stacking assets that eventually took off around 2020, partly fueled by the pandemic's acceleration of remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. He had predicted a billion remote workers by 2030 in 2015, a forecast initially met with skepticism but now seeming reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

His businesses often start from personal needs or observations of "discongruence in society." For example, he built an inflation chart website when others dismissed inflation concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

### Business Model
Peter's ventures, like Nomad List and Remote OK, are highly automated and have extremely high profit margins (Remote OK is 94% pre-tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. He operates as the sole full-time employee, leveraging a small team of contractors:
*   **Customer Support**: One part-time contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Slack Group Moderator**: Essential for managing community drama and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **DevOps**: A best friend handles server maintenance and security, ensuring minimal downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

His development stack is intentionally simple (PHP, JavaScript, jQuery) to ensure rapid development and deployment, allowing for quick iteration and customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

His businesses, such as Nomad List and Remote OK (job boards), and Rebase (an immigration agency for remote workers), generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:07]</a>. Remote OK generates around $1.6 million annually, and Nomad List reached $100,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. He also sells job post bundles up to $50,000, fully automated via Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.

## The "Slo-Mad" Lifestyle

A key misconception about digital nomadism is the idea of rapid travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>. Peter emphasizes that most digital nomads, including himself, are "slo-mads," traveling slowly. Data indicates that the average digital nomad moves every seven months, not every week or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>. This slower pace allows for a more stable life, even with families and pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.

### Practicalities of Living and Owning
Peter has progressively upgraded his living situation from shared hostels to private rooms in hotels, and now prefers "apartment hotels" – furnished hotel rooms with kitchens and living areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>. These offer full service while providing the comfort and space of an Airbnb, solving problems like inconsistent quality and lack of daily cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. He spends around $2,000-$3,500 a month on accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.

He maintains a minimalist approach to possessions, owning only essential items like a backpack, small rolling suitcase, clothes, iPhone, MacBook Pro, and a toothbrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>. This aligns with a philosophy of constraining life to focus on important things, finding convenience in not worrying about material possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:59:00">[53:59:00]</a>.

Regarding animals, he acknowledges the difficulty of traveling internationally with pets but suggests that a "slo-mad" approach (moving every six months) makes it feasible for dogs and cats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. He sees a growing market for pet-friendly travel and accommodation solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

### Finances and Lifestyle Choices
Despite earning millions, Peter practices a disciplined approach to [[Spending and Lifestyle Choices of Successful Entrepreneurs | spending and lifestyle choices of successful entrepreneurs]]. He spends around $4,000-$5,000 a month, excluding taxes, with most of his income invested in ETFs (S&P 500, Asian markets) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>. He actively avoids "lifestyle inflation" because he recognizes that material goods don't bring lasting happiness, citing studies that show happiness levels return to baseline shortly after major purchases or life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:10:00">[50:10:00]</a>. He prioritizes experiences like good, organic food and flying business class for long-haul flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>.

His daily routine involves working on his websites, spending time with friends, going to the gym, sauna, and swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. This structure provides a "chill life" without relying on scheduled calls, allowing for flexibility and personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. He values deep connections with friends who are now his neighbors in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>.

## Future of the Nomadic Lifestyle

Peter believes the remote work trend will only grow, especially as physical jobs become automated, leading to more people adopting nomadic or "slo-mad" lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. This presents opportunities for products catering to this high-end market of tech workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>. He foresees growth in areas like:
*   **Apartment Hotels**: Specifically designed for long-term stays with full amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>.
*   **Furniture Rental**: Companies that set up fully furnished apartments for temporary residents, reducing the "headaches of ownership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative Education**: Such as homeschooling, which is gaining traction due to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>.
*   **Pet-Friendly Travel**: Dedicated services or flights for pet owners due to growing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Well-being

Peter's philosophy is rooted in "radical honesty," aiming to be as open and transparent as possible in his personal life and online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. He dislikes the "fake corporate stuff" he experienced studying business administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. His transparency, including sharing his revenue, has been a significant marketing tool and a part of his identity, though it comes with privacy and security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of [[The importance of focused life goals and seasons | stable happiness]] and meaningful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Having experienced depression and anxiety while traveling alone, he now prioritizes being surrounded by friends and engaging in creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

Peter admires Derek Sivers, the founder of CD Baby, for his philosophical approach to life and business, his writing, and his own nomadic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>. Sivers' focus on a simple life and [[Personal Development and Financial Independence | meaningful work]] resonates deeply with Peter's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Peter's current focus is on building a family and maintaining a "wholesome life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

:::info The "Millionaire" Status
Peter notes that if an app generates $20,000 a month in revenue, it's likely a million-dollar asset, assuming a 4x-5x multiple on profit. This is a far more achievable goal than building a billion-dollar company, especially for indie hackers focused on high-margin, automated software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:00">[31:59:00]</a>.

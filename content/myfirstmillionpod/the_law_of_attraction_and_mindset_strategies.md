Jack Smith, a highly successful entrepreneur who sold his company Vungle for $800 million at age 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, offers a unique perspective on the [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | Law of Attraction]] and its practical applications. While acknowledging the more extreme, "crystal-based" interpretations, Jack emphasizes a rational yet deeply conviction-driven approach to achieving goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

## Practical Applications of the Law of Attraction

Jack's understanding of the [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | Law of Attraction]], as described in the book "Practical Law of Attraction," centers on clearly defining what you want and then taking concrete steps to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. He believes that true conviction is subtly communicated through "micro signals" and body language, influencing how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

### The Power of Conviction
Jack illustrates this with a story about his roommate who struggled to raise a seed round for his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. The roommate's mindset was stuck in self-pity, feeling that investors didn't value him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. This negative energy was palpable, causing him to project a "loser" image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. In contrast, Jack and his co-founder were convinced they would raise funding, even when they had no investors, stating confidently to an investor that it was "going amazing" and they were "just deciding who's going to be the best fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. This conviction led to a term sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

The roommate later experienced a significant [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | mindset and strategies for innovation | mindset shift]], deciding to go "all in" and view his fundraising as a one-shot opportunity, contacting every connection on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Within a month, he successfully raised an "amazing seed round," now having raised over $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. This change in [[the_importance_of_persistence_and_selfbelief | belief]] and resulting action was evident, leading to a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

> "If one investor rejects him now, you'll just be like, oh, well, I'm going to raise funding so I guess this guy was just not fit. I just move on to the next one. You wouldn't see it as reaffirming that you suck. You would just be like, oh, this investor is an idiot like I'm still gonna write funding, it doesn't distract you from the path." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>

### The Virtuous Cycle of Success
Tony Robbins's concept of the "Virtuous Cycle" aligns with Jack's practical application of the [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | Law of Attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>:
1.  **Massive Belief:** When you truly believe something will work, you become highly motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
2.  **Massive Action:** This strong belief leads to intense, dedicated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
3.  **Massive Results:** Consistent massive action tends to yield significant positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
4.  **Reinforced Belief:** The positive results then reinforce the initial strong belief, creating a powerful upward spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

This contrasts with a "Vicious Cycle," where low belief leads to weak action, resulting in poor outcomes, which then reinforce the initial low belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. For entrepreneurs, [[the_importance_of_persistence_and_selfbelief | belief]] and "massive conviction" are prerequisite for any result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

## Feeling It vs. Saying It

The key difference between simply wishing for something and truly manifesting it lies in "feeling it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Jack suggests that some individuals, like himself, may be "delusional" or possess an inherent conviction that things will work out, allowing them to genuinely "feel" success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Adopting Personas
A practical way to cultivate this "feeling" is by adopting specific personas. Beyonce, for example, embodies "Sasha Fierce" before going on stage to overcome nervousness and embrace her performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. Similarly, Tony Robbins encourages individuals to identify and activate their "most badass version" of themselves, training this persona to "drive the car" when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. This concept suggests that personal traits are not fixed but can be consciously cultivated and accessed on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

Jack's own experience of nearing the end of his funds before Vungle's acquisition, yet remaining calm and not creating a "plan B," exemplifies this unwavering conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. He believed he would be "all right" even when the numbers were low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

## Conclusion: Cultivating an Empowered Mindset

Jack's insights into the [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | Law of Attraction]] and mindset are not about passive wishing but about actively shaping reality through a powerful combination of:
*   **Clear Intention:** Knowing precisely what you want.
*   **Deep Conviction:** Genuinely believing in the desired outcome, projected through subtle cues.
*   **Massive Action:** Taking relentless steps towards the goal.
*   **Adaptive Mindset:** Viewing obstacles not as affirmations of failure, but as opportunities to persist or pivot.

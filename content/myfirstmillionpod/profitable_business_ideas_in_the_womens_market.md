Cody Sanchez highlights significant [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | opportunities]] within the women's market, noting that these areas are often "blind spots for men" and thus have "less competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She shares four ideas that she believes women will inherently understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Traditional Wife Movement (Tradwife)

Cody observes a behavioral phenomenon: the pendulum is swinging back towards traditional values and roles for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. She first noticed this trend on Instagram with the "Hobbit Mama" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The #tradwife hashtag on TikTok had 187 million views at the time of recording, indicating a significant and growing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This movement can be seen as a "counterculture" to previously dominant narratives, such as the "Call Her Daddy" podcast, which had seen a decline in its chart rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The trend reflects a desire for traditional gender roles, where, for instance, a woman might prefer to be a stay-at-home wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. An [[utilizing_unique_niches_for_small_businesses | opportunity]] often arises when a belief or behavior cannot be openly expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This societal pendulum swing is also evident in cultural shifts, such as the changing ideal body types championed by the Kardashians, moving from curvy to a slimmer aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Business Ideas within the Tradwife Movement

Cody identifies potential business opportunities by looking at existing successful models and reimagining them for this emerging market:

*   **Hobby Lobby 2.0 / HomeGoods 2.0**: Hobby Lobby, a crafting store, generates $7 billion annually, while the broader TJ Maxx/HomeGoods entity is a $51 billion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: These stores often have unappealing retail experiences (fluorescent lights, dirty, crammed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: Create a "church-ed up" or elevated version of these stores, focusing on aesthetics and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
    *   **HomeGoods Appeal**: Women enjoy a "treasure hunt dynamic" and the thrill of finding a deal on home decor items like vases and candles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This also ties into the low cost of retail real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
    *   **Inspiration**: Joanna Gaines' Magnolia brand, which disrupted "dead industries" like magazines and physical retail space, and built a successful [[ecommerce_business_ideas | e-commerce]] business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
    *   **Model**: A scaled Magnolia model, or a "West Elm Local" concept with rotating popup Etsy shops featuring local providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Another idea is to stage an entire house as a shopping experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The immediate gratification of taking an item home (e.g., a candle, a vase) is also key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Halloween Express (Pop-up Retail)**: Cody attempted to acquire a Halloween Express business, which operates on a temporary pop-up model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   **Model**: Similar to Spirit Halloween, these stores lease vacant retail spaces for a short period (e.g., 60 days before Halloween) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. They standardize their store build-outs (e.g., 10,000 sq ft) for quick and cheap deployment, taking only days or weeks to set up compared to months or a year for a normal store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
    *   **Financials**: The business she looked at included three locations for $600,000 (plus last year's inventory) and was projected to generate $1 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. While claimed margins were 30-45%, Cody estimated a more typical 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. This implies a potential return on investment within two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Inventory management is key, with only 10-15% needing to be new concepts each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### Niche Content and Products for Women

*   **Fantasy Werewolf Romance Novels**: This niche book category is experiencing significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. The romance book market is worth $1.3 billion annually and in some cases accounts for 25-50% of the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. The target demographic is 18-45, shifting from traditional Fabio-esque covers to fantasy themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: The Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing platform allows authors to become "bestsellers" by strategically pricing books at $0.99 or free in niche subcategories, driving downloads and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Authors often have 50+ books, suggesting ghostwriting and quick content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. The *Fifty Shades of Grey* phenomenon started as Twilight fanfiction on Wattpad, highlighting the power of fan-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This suggests a potential for leveraging AI (e.g., ChatGPT) for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   **Fertility and Pregnancy Services**: Getting pregnant has become increasingly difficult and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: Existing solutions like the "Mea" egg-shaped tester are expensive, have confusing apps, and lack notifications or gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: Create a more user-friendly, elegant, and romantic fertility tracking device or app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. For example, a bedside egg that glows when it's "time to get busy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
    *   **Market Potential**: Flo.Health, a period tracking app, has over 300 million downloads and generates over $100 million in revenue, making it a billion-dollar app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. The moment a woman knows she's pregnant represents "the highest likelihood of purchasing intent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, opening doors for data sales, add-ons, and affiliate deals for supplements and medical providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Adoption Consulting for Gay Couples**: It is reportedly "nearly impossible" for gay couples to adopt a baby, presenting a convoluted process with low NPS (Net Promoter Score) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: Develop a consulting or concierge service to help gay male couples navigate the adoption process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. This segment often has high household incomes and high price insensitivity when it comes to having a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Profitability**: A friend paid $25,000 for help navigating the adoption process in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. This indicates high-ticket, high-desire complex workflows are very profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. Leads could be acquired for $2,000 and yield $20,000 per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Personalized Health and Wellness for Women**: Similar to Hims Health, which offers tailored men's health solutions (e.g., TRT), there's an "underserved market" for women's specific biological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Many existing health and dieting trends (like keto) are normalized by men (e.g., Tim Ferriss) but don't work as well for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

## Life Partner Hack: Flower Subscriptions

Cody's husband's "life partner hack" for marriage is a monthly flower subscription for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. Flowers are perceived as a "low ROI low-pain" gift for women, providing a "mood brightener" and signaling that things are "doing okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. For many women, having fresh flowers in the house signifies a level of affluence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. The key is consistency, which a subscription service like Farmgirl Flowers provides automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Business Acquisition: Small, Boring Businesses

Cody explains her journey and philosophy regarding [[developing_million_dollar_business_ideas | developing million dollar business ideas]] and [[developing_unique_business_ideas | unique business ideas]] through acquisition. She initially made millions working in corporate finance (Investment Banking and Private Equity), building big fund families and managing billions in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. However, she found the financial industry "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

She started buying small businesses, initially trying "sexy things" like websites and fashion marketplaces which didn't make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. The "boring ones," like laundromats, were the first to generate real income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. She considers these "gateway drug businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. She purchased businesses while still working full-time, replacing her income before leaving corporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

*   **Laundromats**:
    *   **Concept**: A simple business model where customers put a coin in a machine to get clean or dry clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Operational issues like machine breaks, homeless individuals, or break-ins, which any human can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
    *   **Financials**: The average laundromat makes $100,000 to $500,000 per year with 10-15% margins, yielding $20,000-$50,000 annually for the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. A very large laundromat could do $3 million in revenue, primarily through wash-and-fold services (which have higher margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.
    *   **Strategy**: To make a good living, an owner needs to acquire multiple laundromats (she personally owned 25-30 over her career) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
    *   **Comparison**: Laundromats can offer a better risk-reward trade-off than short-term rentals (e.g., $100k investment for $20-$40k/year profit vs. $250k for a few thousand/year from a rental) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.
    *   **Fit**: Ideal for individuals who are not "good at business" yet or don't want to risk their house, serving as a simple entry point into business ownership before pursuing bigger endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.
*   **Worst Deal**: A small bookkeeping/accounting support business where she lost a couple hundred thousand dollars due to the seller lying or misrepresenting finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Best Deal**: A land acquisition with an RV park, vending machines, and camping area, where the appreciation of the land generated "a few million bucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. Her car wash portfolio is also a contender for the best deal, as multiples "went wild" after Mr. Car Wash went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

Cody prefers cash flow over solely building portfolio value because of her ADHD and desire to be involved in many different businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. She has shifted her focus from building a "tiny version of KKR or Berkshire Hathaway" to owning businesses in her local communities (San Diego, Austin, Phoenix), as it feels more aligned with her values and desire for local support over "big corporate chains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Her portfolio value is estimated at $75-$100 million, primarily from car washes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Her next goal is to make a "really big single bet" by acquiring an MVP company and building on top of it, with a new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

## Content and Personal Brand

Cody has built a massive content brand with a newsletter ("Contrarian Thinking" with hundreds of thousands of subscribers aiming for a million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> and a media company generating 100 million views/month and 5 million subscribers across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

*   **Approach**: Cody believes in systematically pursuing goals rather than organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>. Her background in finance taught her to mechanize, systematize, and replicate consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: She realized she prefers "watching other people grow and build based on the ideas I share with them" over closing large financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This desire to scale her impact led her to content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: She recommends "stealing" from those who have already built successful content machines by hiring top talent (Head of Ops, Head of Content, Head of Finance) and then niche-specific roles (e.g., TikTok, Twitter, Instagram content creators) to delegate stress and maintain output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
*   **Content Flywheel**: Content is a powerful leverage point (audience leverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. Her content about buying businesses attracts sellers, allowing her to acquire businesses faster and at better prices due to established trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>. She then leverages her audience to grow those businesses and creates a community of buyers for future exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   **Criticism**: Some criticism suggests her "real business" is teaching people to buy businesses rather than the actual businesses she owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
    *   **Response**: Numerically, her owned businesses generate more money than her community/courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. She is very good at the content business and aims to "own the entire ecosystem" of learning how to buy, sell, and build businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. She acknowledges genuine errors (like a typo in her work history) but dismisses baseless attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
    *   **Comparison to "Business Gurus"**: She distances herself from figures like Grant Cardone or Tai Lopez, emphasizing that her approach is about hard work and long-term value, not get-rich-quick schemes or one-sided retail investor deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. She aims to democratize access to financial knowledge, believing it's more impactful to teach people to fish than to give them fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.
*   **Niche Content Marketing**: Cody points to examples like Aaron Stokes, who has built a $30 million+ content business by creating content exclusively for auto repair shop owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This demonstrates the power of niching down content into "boring verticals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>. She suggests a "cringe con" concept of reviewing keynotes from niche industry conferences (e.g., self-storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy

Cody values governing oneself before attempting to govern others or worrying about distant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This aligns with the idea of cleaning one's room before cleaning up the world, emphasizing personal responsibility and impact on one's immediate sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. She also believes that in relationships, the focus should be on "I'll take care of me for you, and you take care of you for me," fostering individual growth within the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. She ultimately believes in the power of "builders" who simplify complex ideas to empower others to "go do and go build something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:14">[01:37:14]</a>.# Profitable Business Ideas in the Women's Market

Cody Sanchez highlights significant [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | opportunities]] within the women's market, noting that these areas are often "blind spots for men" and thus have "less competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

    *   **Opportunity**: Create a more user-friendly, elegant, and romantic fertility tracking device or app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. For example, a bedside egg that glows when it's "time to get busy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
    *   **Market Potential**: Flo.Health, a period tracking app, has over 300 million downloads and generates over $100 million in revenue, making it a billion-dollar app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. The moment a woman knows she's pregnant represents "the highest likelihood of purchasing intent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, opening doors for data sales, add-ons, and affiliate deals for supplements and medical providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Adoption Consulting for Gay Couples**: It is reportedly "nearly impossible" for gay couples to adopt a baby, presenting a convoluted process with low NPS (Net Promoter Score) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: Develop a consulting or concierge service to help gay male couples navigate the adoption process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. This segment often has high household incomes and high price insensitivity when it comes to having a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Profitability**: A friend paid $25,000 for help navigating the adoption process in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. This indicates high-ticket, high-desire complex workflows are very profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>. Leads could be acquired for $2,000 and yield $20,000 per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Personalized Health and Wellness for Women**: Similar to Hims Health, which offers tailored men's health solutions (e.g., TRT), there's an "underserved market" for women's specific biological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Many existing health and dieting trends (like keto) are normalized by men (e.g., Tim Ferriss) but don't work as well for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. This represents a potential for [[fitness_business_models | fitness business models]] tailored to women.

## Life Partner Hack: Flower Subscriptions

Cody's husband's "life partner hack" for marriage is a monthly flower subscription for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. Flowers are perceived as a "low ROI low-pain" gift for women, providing a "mood brightener" and signaling that things are "doing okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. For many women, having fresh flowers in the house signifies a level of affluence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. The key is consistency, which a subscription service like Farmgirl Flowers provides automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Business Acquisition: Small, Boring Businesses

Cody explains her journey and philosophy regarding [[developing_million_dollar_business_ideas | developing million dollar business ideas]] and [[developing_unique_business_ideas | unique business ideas]] through acquisition. She initially made millions working in corporate finance (Investment Banking and Private Equity), building big fund families and managing billions in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. However, she found the financial industry "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

She started buying small businesses, initially trying "sexy things" like websites and fashion marketplaces which didn't make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. The "boring ones," like laundromats, were the first to generate real income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. She considers these "gateway drug businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. She purchased businesses while still working full-time, replacing her income before leaving corporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

*   **Laundromats**:
    *   **Concept**: A simple business model where customers put a coin in a machine to get clean or dry clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Operational issues like machine breaks, homeless individuals, or break-ins, which any human can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
    *   **Financials**: The average laundromat makes $100,000 to $500,000 per year with 10-15% margins, yielding $20,000-$50,000 annually for the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. A very large laundromat could do $3 million in revenue, primarily through wash-and-fold services (which have higher margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.
    *   **Strategy**: To make a good living, an owner needs to acquire multiple laundromats (she personally owned 25-30 over her career) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. These are [[successful_single_or_twoperson_business_examples | successful single or two-person business examples]].
    *   **Comparison**: Laundromats can offer a better risk-reward trade-off than short-term rentals (e.g., $100k investment for $20-$40k/year profit vs. $250k for a few thousand/year from a rental) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.
    *   **Fit**: Ideal for individuals who are not "good at business" yet or don't want to risk their house, serving as a simple entry point into business ownership before pursuing bigger endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.
*   **Worst Deal**: A small bookkeeping/accounting support business where she lost a couple hundred thousand dollars due to the seller lying or misrepresenting finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Best Deal**: A land acquisition with an RV park, vending machines, and camping area, where the appreciation of the land generated "a few million bucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. Her car wash portfolio is also a contender for the best deal, as multiples "went wild" after Mr. Car Wash went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

Cody prefers cash flow over solely building portfolio value because of her ADHD and desire to be involved in many different businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. She has shifted her focus from building a "tiny version of KKR or Berkshire Hathaway" to owning businesses in her local communities (San Diego, Austin, Phoenix), as it feels more aligned with her values and desire for local support over "big corporate chains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Her portfolio value is estimated at $75-$100 million, primarily from car washes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Her next goal is to make a "really big single bet" by acquiring an MVP company and building on top of it, with a new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

## Content and Personal Brand

Cody has built a massive content brand with a newsletter ("Contrarian Thinking" with hundreds of thousands of subscribers aiming for a million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> and a media company generating 100 million views/month and 5 million subscribers across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

*   **Approach**: Cody believes in systematically pursuing goals rather than organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>. Her background in finance taught her to mechanize, systematize, and replicate consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: She realized she prefers "watching other people grow and build based on the ideas I share with them" over closing large financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This desire to scale her impact led her to content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: She recommends "stealing" from those who have already built successful content machines by hiring top talent (Head of Ops, Head of Content, Head of Finance) and then niche-specific roles (e.g., TikTok, Twitter, Instagram content creators) to delegate stress and maintain output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
*   **Content Flywheel**: Content is a powerful leverage point (audience leverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. Her content about buying businesses attracts sellers, allowing her to acquire businesses faster and at better prices due to established trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>. She then leverages her audience to grow those businesses and creates a community of buyers for future exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   **Criticism**: Some criticism suggests her "real business" is teaching people to buy businesses rather than the actual businesses she owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
    *   **Response**: Numerically, her owned businesses generate more money than her community/courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. She is very good at the content business and aims to "own the entire ecosystem" of learning how to buy, sell, and build businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. She acknowledges genuine errors (like a typo in her work history) but dismisses baseless attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
    *   **Comparison to "Business Gurus"**: She distances herself from figures like Grant Cardone or Tai Lopez, emphasizing that her approach is about hard work and long-term value, not get-rich-quick schemes or one-sided retail investor deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. She aims to democratize access to financial knowledge, believing it's more impactful to teach people to fish than to give them fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.
*   **Niche Content Marketing**: Cody points to examples like Aaron Stokes, who has built a $30 million+ content business by creating content exclusively for auto repair shop owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This demonstrates the power of [[finding_unique_business_niches | niching down]] content into "boring verticals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>. She suggests a "cringe con" concept of reviewing keynotes from niche industry conferences (e.g., self-storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy

Cody values governing oneself before attempting to govern others or worrying about distant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This aligns with the idea of cleaning one's room before cleaning up the world, emphasizing personal responsibility and impact on one's immediate sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. She also believes that in relationships, the focus should be on "I'll take care of me for you, and you take care of you for me," fostering individual growth within the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. She ultimately believes in the power of "builders" who simplify complex ideas to empower others to "go do and go build something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:14">[01:37:14]</a>.

Jack Smith is a co-founder who sold his company, Vungle, for approximately $800 million when he was 29 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Described as one of the most interesting and humble people known by his friends, Jack's journey is marked by unique approaches to business and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

## Founding Vungle

Vungle began when Jack was around 21 or 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He got into an accelerator/incubator with an initial idea that wasn't working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He then mocked up a PowerPoint presentation for a mobile ad network that would show ads between game levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Developers liked the concept, providing commitments that they would spend money if he could build it, accumulating to about $1 million in commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. With these commitments, Jack hired a developer, Bryan, who is now the co-founder of Webflow, to build the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Initial "Hack" – Recording iPhone Screens
Prior to Vungle, Jack was making educational videos for desktop computer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. When the iPhone App Store launched, he saw an opportunity but realized there was no easy way to record an iPhone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. He figured out a way using a camcorder, a cable, and a jailbroken iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

To test this, with only about $1,000 in the company bank account, Jack sent an intern to an Apple Store to buy the latest iPhone and iPad, instructing them to jailbreak the devices and figure out how to record the screen within 48 hours, with the plan to return them within 14 days if unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>. They successfully recorded the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

This unique ability became a proprietary advantage for Vungle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. While AppLovin and others relied on expensive creative agencies or developer-provided assets, Vungle could directly record app gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Vungle initially charged $500 to make a video for an app, but later offered free, high-quality videos to clients who spent over $25,000 on their advertising network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. These videos were exclusive to Vungle's network, creating a barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

## Vungle's Growth and Sale

Vungle operated as a mobile ad network focused on video advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Unlike competitors who focused on banner ads, Vungle specialized in video ads, which they believed were "10x better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Jack recalls Vungle only raised $10-17 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Within seven years, Vungle was reportedly generating $1 million a day in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The company was ultimately sold for around $800 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Comparison to AppLovin
AppLovin launched 6-12 months after Vungle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While Vungle focused solely on video ads, AppLovin offered a broader range of ad formats, including banner ads and video ads, which allowed them to capture more market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. AppLovin peaked at a market cap of $20-25 billion, significantly larger than Vungle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Lead Generation "Hack"
Vungle employed a team of about 10 people in Pakistan whose job was to play mobile games all day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. When they saw an ad, they would record what the ad was for and which ad network was using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This manual process built Vungle's lead generation database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Post-Vungle Life and Philosophy

After selling Vungle, Jack has not started another business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He explains that his initial success was driven by a "chip on his shoulder" and something to prove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Once Vungle sold, that drive dissipated, and he realized he didn't need more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Instead of building another billion-dollar company, Jack now focuses on where he can have an impact, even if it's deeply impacting a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This includes setting up charities and a digital detox center in Portugal, aiming for healing and impact rather than just financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Law of Attraction and Mindset
Jack believes in a "practical Law of Attraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. It's not just about thinking about what you want, but clearly defining it, feeling it, and taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. He attributes its effectiveness to the subtle micro-signals and body language people project, which can be perceived by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. He shares a story of a friend who, by adopting a mindset of "going all in" and believing he would raise funding, eventually secured significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. This mindset shift prevents setbacks from reinforcing negative beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

He references Tony Robbins' "virtuous cycle" where massive belief leads to massive action, which leads to massive results, reinforcing the belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. This involves taking on a "badass version" of oneself, similar to Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce persona, to drive action and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.

## Unique Life Approaches and Business Insights

Jack is known for his unconventional and often ahead-of-the-curve lifestyle choices and business insights.

### Product Testing Obsession
Jack has an extensive habit of testing and ranking products across various categories, including chocolate, baby apparel, and even clothing from Bonobos (which he would return for credit annually due to their 365-day return policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He maintains spreadsheets for this research and was even banned from Amazon multiple times for excessive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He extends this to gift-giving, providing detailed lists of why certain products are the "best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

### Personal Retreats and Alternative Practices
Jack engaged in practices like Ayahuasca and silent retreats (specifically Vipassana meditation) since 2012, long before they became mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. He found Vipassana too extreme, comparing it to "jumping off an Olympic diving board if you can't swim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. Instead, he found a place in Indonesia for silent retreats inspired by Bill Gates' "Think Week," where he could read extensively and enjoy the experience without strict rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:4:43">[01:4:43]</a>. He plans to expand this concept globally, starting in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

### "Read The F***ing Manual" (RTFM)
Jack advocates for the importance of thoroughly reading manuals and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. He discovered that many people don't read instructions for new technologies like Midjourney or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a>. By doing so, one can quickly become an "expert" and charge a premium for basic knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. He cites Mark Cuban, who built his early wealth by reading software manuals to become an IT installation expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This philosophy suggests that simple diligence can create significant competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:21">[03:31:21]</a>.

### Business Opportunities – The "Reseller Layer"
Jack identifies a business opportunity in creating "reseller layers" on top of industries that are poor at marketing or communicating their services, like tax lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. He gives the example of Nomad Capitalist, a company that acts as a marketing front for tax lawyers, charging significant retainers for information that could be obtained cheaper directly from an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. This model leverages strong branding and marketing to route clients to service providers, taking a substantial cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>. He notes that Dave Ramsey employs a similar model for financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:53">[02:19:53]</a>.

### Parenting Philosophy
Jack and his wife delayed naming their daughter for the first 12 months, simply calling her "Baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>. This was inspired by a desire to get to know her before choosing a name, as Hawaii state law allows name changes without court within the first year with parental consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. They eventually held a naming ceremony where their daughter symbolically picked her own name from various options, creating a unique story for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

Jack also employs a "digital night nanny," a virtual assistant in India who monitors his baby camera all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. This assistant is instructed to only call Jack if the baby cries for longer than seven minutes, allowing Jack and his wife to sleep soundly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

He questions the traditional education system, believing that universities may not exist in their current form in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. He plans to "unschool" his daughter, allowing her to learn what she desires, rather than following a fixed curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. This is inspired by a book about a 14-year-old who built a successful business through self-directed learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. He aims to foster curiosity and real-world skills, potentially bringing in experts like his friends to teach specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. His daughter currently attends a "Forest school," an outdoor-focused program where kids learn through play and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.

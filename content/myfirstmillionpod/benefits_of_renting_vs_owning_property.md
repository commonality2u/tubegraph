The decision between renting and owning property involves various financial, psychological, and lifestyle considerations, with notable figures sharing their perspectives on the benefits of renting.

## The Renting Advantage

For some, renting offers distinct advantages over property ownership. Sean, for example, currently rents a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He has found that renting a furnished apartment in [[real_estate_costs_in_brooklyn | Brooklyn]] for the summer is "so much better than owning a place and having to worry about stuff all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This sentiment is reinforced by his previous experience owning a place in San Francisco for four years before returning to renting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

A key benefit highlighted is the transfer of maintenance responsibilities. When something breaks, a renter can simply "call somebody else, it's their problem, their cost to fix, they have to arrange it, they have to do whatever, and I don't have to think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Financial Considerations

Financial aspects also play a role. In areas like California, property taxes can be "insane" due to high house prices, making it "so hard to beat just this annual property tax every single time on rent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Lifestyle and Psychological Benefits

Dharmesh, the founder of Hubspot and CTO, despite no longer renting, is a "big believer in rentals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. He states that if it were solely up to him, he would be a renter, even with a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. His primary reason is the "decrease in maintenance and wear and tear on one's psyche and soul that ownership bestows upon you is just not worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He desires to live "as close to like living in the matrix as I possibly can," where physical things are "somebody else's problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Dharmesh acknowledges that while he knows other high-net-worth individuals who would prefer renting, most eventually buy once a family is factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He notes that people tend to "over index on the compensation or the kind of current compensation" and "under index on other things" like learning, networking, and raw emotional value when choosing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This perspective can also be applied to the decision of renting versus owning, as the non-monetary benefits of renting may outweigh perceived financial gains from ownership for some.

### Family and Neighborhood Factors

The presence of a family can shift the preference towards ownership. Dharmesh mentions that his wife loves gardening and having a yard, which is "kind of hard to do in a rental" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Another observation shared is that "renting is amazing until your wife wants a specific house and then once your wife wants a specific house or in a specific neighborhood that neighborhood like like higher end neighborhoods have no rentals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This forces individuals into a different path, illustrating how personal and family preferences can override the perceived [[benefits_and_strategies_of_business_ownership | benefits]] of renting.

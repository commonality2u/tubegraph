[[Rob Dyrdeks financial journey from 15M to 350M | Rob Dyrdek]] considers his journey to wealth creation to have started "from zero" in 2016, despite being worth $15-20 million at the time, because to a future billionaire, a millionaire is "broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His significant wealth has been created primarily between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Approach
Dyrdek's approach to business and investment has evolved significantly:
*   **Early Mistakes** In 2013, he describes himself as "dumb as dirt" regarding business, lacking understanding of multi-dimensional business, value creation, and investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. He admits to investing "recklessly" when younger, which he now calls "money's dumb" rather than "money fearless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Multi-Dimensional View** He transitioned from looking at media and marketing multi-dimensionally to applying the same holistic view to business, understanding how to create and build businesses for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Evolving Goals** Initially, he aimed to build 50-70 companies, owning 25-35, and selling them for $50-150 million each, making 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:00]</a>. After selling a company for $200 million and receiving $150 million, his focus shifted to fewer, larger deals, aiming for $50-200 million per deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Honest Play** He believes having significant money allows him to "play the game more honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Risk Underwriting** Dyrdek underwrites risk by seeking opportunities to add leverage and create additional value. For example, he invested $10 million into the company that bought his production company, leveraging his ability to secure a large television deal for additional equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   **Time Optimization** He works less now than ever before, maintaining a 40-hour work week to manage his family office, venture portfolios, television commitments, and podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. His investment time is minimal, focusing on a few hours a year for his cash-flowing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal** His current net worth is just under $350 million, with a clear financial model to reach $1 billion through both slow compounding and large "chunks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Current Investment Focus
Dyrdek primarily invests in real estate and businesses he personally creates, with no new venture investments since Jolie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

### Real Estate
His real estate strategy focuses on acquiring cash-flowing properties.
*   **Cash Flow & Equity Growth** His buildings provide 5-6% tax-free cash flow and 7-10% equity growth long-term, resulting in 15-16% IRR on some investments, with others reaching 35-42% IRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **1031 Exchange** He utilizes 1031 exchanges to roll profits into new buildings on an ongoing basis, compounding wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **Passive Income** He defines passive income in real estate as investing money with an operator who provides cash back, rather than directly managing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. He spends a few hours a year on this cash-flowing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

#### Forever Estates
In 2015, Dyrdek purchased a 4-acre property in Beverly Hills for $10 million cash, intending it to be his "forever home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>.
*   He considers this a "horrible decision" and a "liability" at the time, as he invested nearly all his cash ($12 million total) into land rather than income-generating assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   He has since bought and remodeled multiple houses in the same neighborhood while continuing to design Forever Estates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   The property incurs $200,000 in annual carrying costs (taxes, homeowners fees) plus ongoing architect fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
*   He plans to build the house in the fall, estimating a $20 million construction cost, which he will pay cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   The long-term strategy for Forever Estates is to place it in a trust, pay rent to the trust, and build an endowment to make the home self-operational and remain in his family for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

### Venture Creations
Dyrdek focuses on "venture creation" rather than simply investing.

#### Momentous Protein
Dyrdek co-founded Momentous protein with Matt Wan in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Vision** Matt Wan, an 18-year-old at the time, envisioned creating the "Ferrari of supplements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Initial Investment** Dyrdek invested $200,000-$300,000 for 30% of the business initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Challenges** For years, the company struggled with sales, being overpriced and failing to find a market, leading to constant capital burn and dilution of Dyrdek's equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:30]</a>. Dyrdek believes advising Matt Wan not to go to Harvard was a mistake in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Turnaround** The business exploded "overnight" after merging with Amped (a company Dyrdek almost invested in back in 2015) and securing an endorsement deal with Andrew Huberman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Despite the growth, Dyrdek's share was diluted to about 4%, and he considers the return on his initial $300,000 investment, while significant for a regular investor, not why he "plays the game of venture creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. He had initially projected selling the business for $100 million in under five years with 20% ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

#### Jolie
Dyrdek was approached by a seasoned CEO, the founder of the footwear brand Greats, with an idea for a filtered shower water product in the beauty space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Business Model** The product, Jolie, is a hardware unit with recurring filter revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Market Analysis** Despite a tiny existing market for filtered showerheads (under $1 billion), Dyrdek saw it as pure white space with potential to become a massive business in the beauty sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition** Jolie's initial customer acquisition involved collecting and scraping data on water contaminants by zip code, providing personalized reports to potential customers before the product even launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Success** The company achieved $4 million in sales in its first year and is projected to reach $40 million this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. It's valued at over $200 million within 1.5 years due to its rare hardware subscription service model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
*   **Investment** Dyrdek was the primary investor, putting in $800,000. The company is profitable and has not needed to raise additional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

#### Thrill One Media
Dyrdek's professional skateboarding league and production company merged with Nitro Circus to create Thrill One Media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
*   **Sale** Thrill One Media was sold for $300 million, with Dyrdek receiving $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
*   **Re-investment** He invested $10 million of his proceeds back into the group that bought Thrill One Media, leveraging his ability to secure a large television deal for a bigger stake in the production company and sports property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. This $10 million investment quickly grew to $60 million by securing a billion-dollar, seven-year television deal for his show *Ridiculousness* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **Partners** He partners with Dana White and the Fertitta family, who own the UFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
*   **Production Company Perspective** Dyrdek views production companies as a "shoot what you kill game" where distributors control the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. Value is volatile, often becoming zero if a show is canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. Profitability relies on owning vertically integrated aspects (post-production, music) to scrape margin from budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>. He emphasizes the need to stack multiple shows and build long-term sustainability to create a sellable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>. He calls it an "extraordinarily difficult" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

## Future Trends and Personal Development
*   **Health & Wellness** Dyrdek anticipates a significant impact from continuous glucose monitors evolving to track dopamine and cortisol, offering real-time insights into well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. He has a [[Rob Dyrdeks approach to health wellness and longevity | deep longevity plan]] with a goal to live 114 years and 54 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.
*   **Existence Management System** He plans to create an "existence management system" software to help people manage their life holistically, optimize for high-energy present moments, and guide their lives towards higher probabilities of health, happiness, and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This software, along with a book and philosophy, aims to help people transition from "erratic" to "harmonious high quality existences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>. This project was partly inspired by previous discussions on how he could monetize his data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Pursuit of Perfection** Dyrdek aims to reach a state of never getting angry, having no negative thoughts, being completely harmonious and balanced in all relationships, time, health, and happiness, and being filled with gratitude every day, even under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. He wants to be "proof that you can get there" and then build the tools for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

Becoming a better writer can significantly impact your career and ability to persuade others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, grow an audience, or sell products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Effective writing leads to results, not just beautiful prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The ultimate goal of writing is persuasion in the most scalable way, convincing people to feel a certain way or take an action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Beyond persuasion, writing forces [[role_of_writing_in_idea_generation | clear thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Bad writing often indicates bad thinking, while clear thinking translates into clear writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Writing also generates new ideas; it's a "truth tell potion" that reveals clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, and especially in longer forms, it's difficult to hide bad thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Inspired by a question on how to get better at writing with an 80/20 approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, a three-step framework for effective writing has been developed:

## The 3-Step Writing Process

This framework emphasizes working backwards from the desired outcome and includes specific stages before, during, and after drafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Step 1: Pre-Writing Preparation

Before typing a single word, it's crucial to set the stage for your writing.

*   **Begin with the End in Mind**:
    *   **Desired Reaction**: What emotion do you want the reader to feel (e.g., LOL, WTF, OMG, heartwarming)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. People share or act if they feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Desired Action**: What specific action do you want them to take (e.g., click buy, share, forward, sign a petition)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
    *   **One Takeaway**: If the reader remembers only one line or sentence, what would it be? People remember sentences, not books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Start with a Headline and Sub-headline**: The sub-headline (a single sentence) acts as a clarifying statement for what you're about to write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Copy Work (Warm-up)**:
    *   **Method**: Select writing you admire (a book, script, blog post) and literally copy it by hand or type it for 10-15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Do not think, add, or improve; just transcribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
    *   **Purpose**: This technique helps you absorb the rhythm and style of effective writers through osmosis, like a musician playing cover songs to warm up and develop their style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Build a Swipe File**: Maintain a collection of great phrases, headlines, openers, closers, or entire articles that you find compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This serves as a source of inspiration and a shortcut when you need to write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

### Step 2: Drafting

The drafting phase is where you quickly get your initial thoughts down.

*   **Brain Dump**: Write as fast as possible, accepting that the initial draft will be imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The key is to overcome the fear of looking stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overthinking**: Do not try to make the first draft perfect or "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. A quick and dirty draft is preferable to a fatigued, overthought one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

### Step 3: Incubate and Edit

This is where true greatness in writing is forged.

*   **Incubation Period**: After drafting, step away from your work for a period (from minutes to a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Engage in passive thinking activities like walking, showering, or cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This allows your brain to process ideas subconsciously, leading to breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Editing**: Return to your draft with fresh eyes. This is where most of the value is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. "Great writing is great editing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Stephen King calls it "killing your darlings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. It becomes "so obvious" what to change, delete, or move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Writing

In addition to the framework, consider these principles for better outcomes:

*   **Unlearn School Habits**: Forget word counts, fancy vocabulary, and extensive intros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Online writing rewards conciseness and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Don't Bury the Lead**: The first sentence should "punch" and grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Create a "Curiosity Gap" that makes the reader want to read the next sentence, not the whole thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. Test by covering up text and asking if the opening makes you want to read more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Write Like You Talk**: The most engaging writing feels like a direct conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. If you can explain an idea simply out loud, you can write it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Avoid jargon (e.g., "utilize" instead of "use") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Use a voice memo test: if you wouldn't tell a friend about it, don't write about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. Write to one person, even if millions will read it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Write Simply**: Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level (or even lower, like 4th grade for mass appeal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Tools like Hemingway App can help check your reading level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Famous writers like Warren Buffett simplify their language as their topics become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Master Storytelling**:
    *   **Intention and Obstacle**: Every good story has a character who wants something (intention) and an obstacle in their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
    *   **Stakes**: Clearly establish what is at stake if the character doesn't achieve their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. The true art is establishing "high stakes emotions in a low stakes environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, making relatable small moments feel significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
*   **Vary Sentence Length for Rhythm**: While short sentences are often better by default, mixing short, medium, and occasional long sentences creates a pleasing rhythm, like "music" that engages the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Use tactics like replacing commas with periods and starting new sentences with "and" or "but" to control flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Be Yourself**: The most effective writing is simply "you pushed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. Don't try to become a different character for your content to be popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. Write about what genuinely interests you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. This creates a "personal monopoly" where nobody can compete with your unique perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

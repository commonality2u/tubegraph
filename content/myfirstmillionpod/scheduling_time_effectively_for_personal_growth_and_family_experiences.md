Jesse Itzler, a successful entrepreneur, author, and ultra-marathoner, outlines a comprehensive process for planning and "dominating" the year, focusing on personal growth and enriching life experiences rather than merely reacting to external demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His system, refined over 25-30 years, aims to help individuals create a fulfilling year by being intentional with their [[time_management_and_life_optimization | time management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Annual Personal Review: Closing Out the Year Light

December and January are considered critical months for setting the stage for the year ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Itzler emphasizes the importance of a personal year-end review, similar to how businesses assess their performance, to evaluate what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Personal Life Management
> Unlike business operations, many individuals are not taught how to manage their personal lives, including handling emails, scheduling, or [[balancing_work_and_personal_life | balancing work and personal life]] with family responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Itzler's approach is a product of trial and error, adapting as life evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The overarching theme for closing out the year is to "come into the new year light," shedding all "baggage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This process involves:

*   **Physical Decluttering**: Going through clothes that haven't been worn in 12 months and donating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Organizing the closet to reduce decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Workspace Organization**: Clearing all clutter from the desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Email Bankruptcy**: Responding to necessary emails, deleting unnecessary ones, and filing the rest. The goal is to start the new year with a "net zero" inbox to avoid playing catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Digital Cleanup**: Unsubscribing from unwanted emails and deleting unused apps to "get light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Organization**: Cleaning out cars to ensure no clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **File Management**: Creating new files for the upcoming year for physical documents like medical records and bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Expressing Gratitude
A key practice is writing handwritten letters to 20-30 people who significantly impacted the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This act of genuine gratitude, which Itzler has done for 30 years, stands out in the digital age and builds strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He emphasizes that this cannot be outsourced, as the "soul" and intention behind the act are what make it impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Identifying Areas for Improvement
Itzler suggests a "blender" exercise: Imagine putting all aspects of your life (finances, health, weight, relationships, living situation) into a blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Rate your overall happiness and satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The immediate thoughts that bring your score down are the areas that need attention. These issues won't magically improve and require intentional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The goal is to identify 2-3 areas for improvement in the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

## Planning for the New Year: The Three-Step System
Itzler presents three core strategies that, if implemented, can significantly improve one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This system is about playing "life on offense" by proactively scheduling experiences rather than letting external requests fill your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

### 1. The Misogi (Year-Defining Thing)
Inspired by an old Japanese ritual, a Misogi is one "big year-defining thing" that you accomplish each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. This could be launching a podcast, running a first marathon, or a challenging physical feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] Benefits of a Misogi
> *   **Something to Show**: Provides a tangible accomplishment for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
> *   **Improved Presence**: Working towards a challenging goal helps you show up differently and more effectively at work and home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
> *   **Tool for Saying No**: Provides a reason to decline less important commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
> *   **Anticipation**: Creates something exciting to look forward to, boosting motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
> *   **Growth**: Even if the ultimate goal isn't fully achieved, the attempt fosters bravery and [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

For individuals who are not financially free, a Misogi doesn't have to be expensive. It can be something like swimming the Coney Island Polar Plunge for the cost of a subway token or a low-cost trip to a national park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. The key is to challenge oneself and do something outside the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

### 2. Kevin's Rule (Mini-Adventures)
Named after a friend, Kevin's Rule involves scheduling one mini-adventure every other month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. These are one-day or one-weekend activities that you wouldn't normally do, like fishing with kids instead of watching a game, or visiting college friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. The purpose is to [[balancing_work_and_personal_life | balance work and personal life]] and avoid becoming stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Over a lifetime, this can lead to hundreds of unique experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

### 3. Adding Winning Habits
Instead of traditional New Year's resolutions, Itzler suggests adding a new "winning habit" each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Examples include drinking 100 ounces of water daily, never being late to a meeting, or adding a 10-minute meditation practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. This gradual approach layers in beneficial routines, leading to a "winning mindset" and significant [[personal_development_and_growth | personal growth]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Practical Application: The Big Ass Calendar
Itzler relies on a large, visual paper calendar to map out his entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. As soon as an event or trip is known, it's written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This includes:

*   School start/end dates and camp dates for kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   Regular date nights and quarterly "station" trips with his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   Family dinners and trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Rocks and Sand Analogy
> This planning method aligns with the "rocks and sand" analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. By placing the "big rocks" (intentional life experiences, family time, personal challenges) on the calendar first, there is still space for the "sand" (smaller meetings, appointments, daily tasks) to fill in around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This contrasts with letting daily tasks fill the calendar first, leaving no room for significant experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

Having a visual calendar helps identify gaps in time and allows for better tracking towards goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. It enables individuals to say "no" to less important requests because their time is already committed to their own priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

## Prioritizing Personal Time: Becoming "Time Rich"
Itzler believes being "time rich" is as crucial as being financially rich, especially as one gets older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. His philosophy of carving out 2-3 hours daily for personal time came from observing successful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This time is cumulative and can involve activities like saunas, reading, walks, or workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. The core idea is that by taking care of oneself, one shows up better as a parent, spouse, CEO, or employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

> [!TIP] Time Richness for Everyone
> Being "time rich" doesn't require financial wealth; it requires being organized, scheduled, and allocating time to prioritize oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Work will always be there, but personal well-being should not be sacrificed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

## Daily/Weekly Planning & "Daily Vitamins"
On Sunday nights, Itzler reviews his upcoming week, transferring appointments from his phone to a paper planner for a clear, at-a-glance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

He also conceptualizes "daily vitamins" – a list of 10 activities he loves to do that make him feel strong (e.g., saunas, cold plunges, running, playing with kids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. He aims to incorporate two or three of these "vitamins" into his daily routine, even if he can't do them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. This ensures he is "all in" and showing up as his best self for other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
Itzler emphasizes that:
*   **Life is Short**: Don't waste years waiting for the "right time" or delaying experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. Circumstances change, and opportunities may not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Say Yes to Adventure**: It's never the "right time," you have to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. While there might be sacrifices, not doing it leads to regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **Intentionality**: By intentionally planning personal growth and family experiences, you can build a year you are truly proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

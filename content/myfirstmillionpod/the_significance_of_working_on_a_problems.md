When starting over from scratch, without money, special skills, or a network, the most effective strategy for success involves a clear focus on [[challenge_of_achieving_ambitious_goals | ambitious goals]] and active learning, particularly by engaging with "A+ problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This approach prioritizes growth and impact over immediate financial gain.

## The Learn Phase and Project Selection

In the initial "learn phase" of a career, the objective is not primarily to earn money, but to optimize for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This means choosing opportunities that offer more hands-on experience and exposure to smarter people, even if it means a lower salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The key performance indicator (KPI) for this phase is how much personal and professional growth is achieved each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

When selecting a project or job during this phase, whether starting a company or joining an existing one, the primary criteria are to:
*   **Be around the smartest and most ambitious people** in your desired field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This environment fosters contagious ambition and shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Moving to a relevant hub, like Silicon Valley for startups or Los Angeles for content creators, can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Engage in actual, impactful work** rather than merely observing from the sidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Avoid prestigious positions where you might be employee number 42,000, disconnected from real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Identifying and Tackling the A+ Problem

The most crucial element is to always be working on the "A+ problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This refers to the most pressing, high-impact challenge or opportunity a company or venture faces at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

Examples of A+ problems include:
*   Addressing a lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   Figuring out why growth has stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   Managing overwhelming growth and scaling operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Practical Application
The speaker provides personal examples of how this approach led to significant breakthroughs:
*   At Twitch, instead of focusing on his assigned role as Director of Esports, he and his co-founder decided to find a project that could meaningfully impact the company's "billion-dollar" revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. They "went on strike" from day one, seeking out the A+ problem by asking questions and observing company operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This led to pitching a major project directly to the CEO, who then created a special team for them to lead, resulting in a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   When a top streamer left Twitch, he immediately identified this as the new A+ problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. He dropped his other tasks, analyzed the situation, wrote a strategic memo, and sent it directly to the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This proactive approach led to him being brought into the core team addressing the issue, despite his initial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

For entrepreneurs, working on the A+ problem is inherent to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This skill, honed through entrepreneurship, can then be applied even within larger corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The principle is to always focus on the "one big thing" that truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

In summary, during the learn phase, aspiring individuals should prioritize finding the [[finding_and_pursuing_personal_purpose | intersection of personal passion and market need]], leveraging [[identifying_and_exploiting_personal_edges | personal edges]], optimizing for exposure to top talent, and consistently working on the most impactful "A+ problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. This strategic focus ensures maximum learning and positions one for long-term success.

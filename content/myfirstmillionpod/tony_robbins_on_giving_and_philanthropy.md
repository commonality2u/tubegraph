[[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] emphasizes the transformative power of giving, advocating that it's not something reserved for the wealthy, but rather a practice that cultivates abundance and eradicates scarcity. His philosophy is rooted in personal experiences and observations of successful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## The Salad Bar Story: Giving from Scarcity
[[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] recounts a pivotal moment early in his career when he was financially struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. At 24 years old, down to his last $19-$22, with unpaid rent, he went to an all-you-can-eat salad and taco bar to load up on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. While there, he witnessed a young boy, about three feet tall, displaying remarkable courtesy to his mother, opening doors and pulling out her chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

Moved by the boy's class act, [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] approached him after finishing his meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. He told the boy he had so much respect for his actions and, without a plan, impulsively gave the boy all the money he had left â€“ $19 and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. After this act of giving, [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] felt "high as a kite" despite having no money and walking home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. The next morning, he received an unexpected $1,200 check from a friend who was repaying a loan from two and a half years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

This experience solidified his belief that when he gave not "to get" and gave "what wasn't easy," he received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Since that day, he states he has never again felt scarcity, realizing that his brain understood there was "more than enough" when he was willing to give even when he felt he had nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

## Principles of Giving and Wealth
[[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] emphasizes several key principles related to giving:
*   **Giving transforms out of scarcity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **You must practice giving early:** If someone isn't willing to give a dime out of a dollar, they won't give $10 million out of $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Gratitude is the secret to wealth:** Sir John Templeton, a self-made billionaire investor, taught [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] that true richness comes from gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Tithing leads to wealth:** Templeton also noted that he had "never met anybody that tithed for at least 10 years who didn't become wealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] himself proudly states he has given away 17% of his earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Impact and Continuation of Giving
[[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]]'s giving extends to his organization, which provides "a billion meals" annually, a practice he attributes to his own childhood experience of not having enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

The host of the podcast was inspired by [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]]'s message on giving, leading him to commit to "paying it forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He started by sending one person to a [[personal_transformation_through_tony_robbins_events | Tony Robbins event]] (UPW) the year after he attended, and has since sent 44 people to [[personal_transformation_through_tony_robbins_events | Tony Robbins' events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. He plans to send another 44 people this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>, an initiative [[tony_robbins_influence_on_successful_individuals | Tony Robbins]] committed to matching, doubling the total to 88 tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. Understanding how to manage and leverage IP, including its movement into the public domain, can create significant business opportunities.

## Public Domain Opportunities
Certain intellectual property, like books, moves into the public domain after a period of time when its copyright expires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This transition allows for new commercial uses and business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Understanding Copyright Expiration
Copyrights, which protect original works of authorship, typically last for the life of the creator plus a set number of years, often around 50 to 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. The exact duration can vary, and laws have been extended, such as the period for Mickey Mouse's copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. The purpose of expiring copyrights is generally believed to allow the public to benefit from a free market over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### Examples of Public Domain IP
*   **The Bible:** As an ancient text, it is in the public domain, allowing for new editions like "cool millennial Bibles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Winnie the Pooh:** The book "Winnie the Pooh," written ages ago, entered the public domain in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. This opens up opportunities to modernize the book or potentially create new merchandise, depending on the specific IP covered by the expired copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. Large franchises like Pok√©mon, Hello Kitty, and Winnie the Pooh have generated over $80 billion in merchandise sales alone, highlighting the significant value of IP beyond original content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

### Resources for Tracking Public Domain IP
*   **publicdomainreview.org**: This website tracks what IP is moving into the public domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. The site itself monetizes by selling prints of public domain art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Foodtimeline.org**: While not a business opportunity, this website tracks the historical citations of food items, demonstrating how niche, freely available information can still attract significant traffic (over 150,000 page views a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Interestingly, the domain for this site, whose sole author passed away, is set to expire in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### Magnus Carlsen and Play Magnus
Magnus Carlsen, the world's number one chess player, has successfully built a business empire, unlike many athletes who struggle to accrue equity in their personal brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. At 31 years old, he created his own company, Play Magnus, which has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Play Magnus**: This publicly traded company has 250 employees, 4 million registered users, and a market cap of $115 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. It offers a $14/month "Plus Membership" and reported $5 million in revenue last quarter, trending towards $20 million annually in recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. Carlsen holds a 9% stake in Play Magnus and a substantial ownership in his streaming platform, Magnus Chess, making him worth several million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Chess.com**: A competitor in the chess space, Chess.com is largely bootstrapped and boasts 150 million monthly unique users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. It's rumored to be a multi-billion dollar company, offering features like post-game blunder analysis, which historically required a coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

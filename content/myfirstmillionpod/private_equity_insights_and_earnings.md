Private equity (PE) involves significant [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | financial activity]] and can be a path to substantial wealth, though it comes with demanding work.

## Structure and Earnings in Private Equity
If an individual is a General Partner (GP), meaning one of the principal owners of a private equity fund, and has a history of running multiple successful funds over time, it is generally safe to assume they possess a net worth exceeding $50 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>

The financial model of private equity funds is based on two primary revenue streams:
*   **Management Fees** Most funds charge annual management fees, typically ranging from 1.5% to 2% of the total fund size. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a> For a substantial fund, such as one with $1 billion or more under management, these fees can generate over $20 million per year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> Given that most funds operate with a relatively small number of employees, their operational costs are not excessively high. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>
*   **Carried Interest (Carry)** In addition to fees, funds also take a percentage of the profits, known as "carry," which can be between 15% to 25% of returns above a specified hurdle rate (e.g., 8%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> If a fund manages to double its value, there could be over $200 million in carry to distribute, with the principal owners receiving the largest share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>

For Vice Presidents (VPs) in private equity who perform well, earnings can reach seven figures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>

## Workload and Challenges
Despite the high earnings, the work in private equity is demanding. Long-time GPs in the industry often work 70+ hours a week, with the work being consistently stressful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a> The nature of the work often involves placing significant debt on acquired companies, leading to considerable stress during economic downturns, as professionals constantly address issues like breaking debt covenants and restructuring. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> A substantial portion of time (around 80%) is dedicated to managing underperforming companies in the portfolio, while successful investments typically require less active management. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>

## Private Equity vs. the Information Economy
From a time-adjusted perspective, earning $50 million in private equity is considered a "grindy" process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> While it offers a relatively "low beta" or high-certainty path to wealth accumulation for partners in a successful fund, it typically requires working intensely until around 60 years old. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>

In contrast, careers in the information economy, such as creating newsletters, podcasts, or courses, can offer significantly better [[insights_on_investing_time_and_money_to_increase_personal_leverage | time leverage]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a> For example, earning $300,000 from a course in a single week could allow for several months of personal time off. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>

## Personal Journey from Private Equity
One individual's experience highlights a shift from being an anonymous private equity professional to a public figure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> During the COVID-19 pandemic, having more time for reflection led to questioning career satisfaction after six years of 80-100 hour workweeks in PE. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a> This period provided an opportunity to explore new avenues, like writing on Twitter, which initially was not seen as a money-making venture but eventually gained significant traction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>

A pivotal moment occurred during a career crossroads where the individual considered joining another traditional [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investing firm]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a> However, advice suggested pursuing the new, energy-generating, and scalable ventures rather than a "safe" but less fulfilling path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a> This decision to pivot was reinforced by a hypothetical stock pitch for a hedge fund job: a "buy" recommendation for Stitch Fix at $46, which later dropped to $3.56. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>

The shift allowed for the establishment of:
*   A $10 million [[venture_backed_companies_and_special_situations_investments | venture fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>
*   A newsletter with 125,000+ subscribers generating significant monthly revenue from sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>
*   An [[consulting_for_private_equity_businesses | agency business]] that scaled to nearly six figures in monthly gross revenue with high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>

This transformation demonstrates how early engagement in emerging markets, even if later perceived as "cringe" due to saturation, can provide a platform to launch more substantial and personally aligned ventures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>

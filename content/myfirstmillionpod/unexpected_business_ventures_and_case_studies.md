This article explores various [[case_studies_of_business_startup_growth | business startup growth]] and [[entrepreneurial_success_stories | entrepreneurial success stories]] that represent unexpected or innovative ventures, often spun out of existing platforms or personal brands. These examples highlight diverse paths to success, from media spin-offs to curated auction platforms and unique product launches.

## The Daily Wire and Jeremy's Razors

Ben Shapiro co-founded The Daily Wire, a subscription media company that positioned itself as an alternative to mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. In just three to four years, it generates over $100 million annually in subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

An unexpected spin-off from The Daily Wire is Jeremy's Razors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This venture was launched after Harry's Razors, a former advertiser, pulled its support from The Daily Wire due to ideological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The Daily Wire's CEO, Jeremy, launched his own razor company, Jeremy's Razors, with a direct challenge to Harry's. The launch video alone garnered 22 million views in nine months, and the company is reportedly selling millions of dollars in products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The website and branding are designed to be a "middle finger" to Harry's Razors, emphasizing values like truth, free speech, and masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This strategy demonstrated how to capitalize on a perceived "Us Versus Them" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Creator-Led Business Empires

Several content creators have leveraged their audience to build substantial businesses beyond ad revenue, providing valuable [[lessons_from_entrepreneurship | lessons from entrepreneurship]].

### Derek (More Plates More Dates)
Derek, known for his YouTube channel More Plates More Dates, has built two brands: Gorilla Mind and Marek Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Gorilla Mind, a supplements brand, receives over a million visits a month and is conservatively estimated to be doing at least $1 million a month in revenue, potentially up to $4 million a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Marek Health is a TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) clinic that helps men with hormone replacement, hair loss, and sexual wellness, and has grown to over 200 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Kayla Itsines (Sweat App)
Kayla Itsines, a fitness influencer, created "The Sweat App," which was reportedly sold for $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This demonstrates a shift from merely promoting products to creating a proprietary business from a large following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Mark Rober (Science Kits)
Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer known for his engineering YouTube videos, launched a monthly subscription box featuring science kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Danny Austin (Divi)
Danny Austin created Divi, a scalp care brand for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. She initially discussed her personal struggle with hair loss, creating relatable content, and then offered a solution through her product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Divi achieved $20 million in sales within its first 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Mindy McKnight (Cute Girl Hair)
Mindy McKnight, a YouTube content creator who demonstrated hairstyles for her five daughters, launched a product line called Cute Girl Hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Her brand achieved over $100 million in sales with a launch through Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This [[entrepreneur_success_stories | success story]] highlights the power of aligning a creator's personal story, content, and product with mass distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

### Guzman (Alphaland)
Guzman, a fitness influencer with a large Hispanic following, launched a 50,000-square-foot gym called Alphaland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. He also has a successful clothing line, demonstrating how personal brand and community can be leveraged for large-scale physical and product ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## Curated Online Auctions

The rise of specialized online auction platforms like Bring a Trailer and Cars & Bids represents an interesting new business model, serving as [[case_studies_of_business_startup_growth | case studies of business startup growth]] in niche markets.

### Bring a Trailer
Bring a Trailer is an online platform for car enthusiasts, specializing in vehicles from the 1970s to the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Despite a seemingly unsophisticated, blog-like website, it sold $1.2 billion worth of cars in one year, generating around $100 million in net revenue with only about 80 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

### Cars & Bids
Doug DeMuro, a popular YouTube car reviewer, launched Cars & Bids, a similar curated auction platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. This platform is predicted to become a multi-hundred-million-dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. The success of these platforms lies in their ability to offer a "beautifully done" and curated experience, avoiding the overwhelming options found on general sites like eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

### Other Curated Auction Opportunities
The concept of curated online auctions could extend to other high-ticket items, such as luxury watches (like Hodinkee, which sells $40,000 watches online) or homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. The key is to provide excellent curation and beautiful photography, similar to how Airbnb sent photographers to high-end listings to increase their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Potential areas for curated auctions include golf equipment (high enthusiast market, high price point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a> and even livestock, where high-value animals like bulls can cost $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Sam Altman's Investment Philosophy

Sam Altman, known for his work with Y Combinator and OpenAI (ChatGPT), has a unique investment philosophy that has led to significant wealth and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Early Success and Prolific Investing
Altman's first startup, Looped, sold for $41 million, from which he personally earned $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. Despite this, he quickly became a prolific investor. His second investment was in Stripe, which became one of the decade's best investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. He raised a $21 million fund from Peter Thiel and other "prodigies" after his first startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. Within four years, this fund was up 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

### Investing in "Non-Obvious but Correct" Ideas
Altman's [[adventurous_business_ventures | adventurous business ventures]] and investment strategy focused on "non-obvious but correct" ideas, especially in science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. He made significant early investments in companies like Cruise (a self-driving car company, acquired by GM for $1 billion), and even a $375 million personal check into Helion, a nuclear fusion company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

He observed that four out of his five biggest early winners were companies that nobody else wanted to fund, and were often considered bad ideas at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This highlights the importance of being willing to invest in unpopular but potentially transformative ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

> "Of all the biggest winners... four of the five nobody wanted to fund. They were not oversubscribed. People generally thought they were bad ideas. In fact, I almost got talked out of doing them because smart people were telling me why these are bad ideas." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>

This philosophy extends to his view on growth, where he advises focusing on adding "one zero" to what you're doing each year, rather than getting caught in unrealistic fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

> "Every year you need to think about how you're going to add one zero to what you're doing but don't think beyond one zero." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>

These [[success_stories_and_lessons_in_entrepreneurship | success stories and lessons in entrepreneurship]] from unexpected ventures emphasize the value of identifying niche markets, leveraging personal brands, and making bold, contrarian bets.

Successfully running in-person events is a significant competitive advantage in a world saturated with online communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Few individuals or organizations excel at it, making it a powerful differentiator when done well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Case Study: MicroConf

Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur, founded [[microconf_and_the_events_business | Microconf]], an events business, in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. What began as a side project became a substantial part of his work after he sold his company, Drip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

Microconf is projected to generate low seven figures in top-line revenue, possibly between $1 million and $1.5 million in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

### Purpose and Mission

Instead of purely being a profit machine, [[microconf_and_the_events_business | Microconf]] operates largely as a service to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. Many local events, such as those held in San Jose, Atlanta, or Austin, are run at break-even or even at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

The overarching mission of these events is to expand the number of independent startups globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. While the term "bootstrapped startups" was initially used, the mission now includes those who raise small amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Microconf maintains a net profit margin of 10-20%, which could be higher, but there's no need to maximize profits at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

### Building Trust and Sponsorships

Events rely heavily on sponsors, but building trust takes time. In Microconf's first year (2011), only 70 out of 200 available tickets were sold, and sponsorships were minimal (around $2,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. It took two to three years for sponsors to build trust and commit larger amounts, with some booking a year in advance for $50,000 to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

### Community Building

In-person events foster a strong, tightly-knit community that online communities alone cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. [[host_an_event_and_storytelling_as_business_growth_strategies | Meeting people in person]] leads to higher retention rates (60-70% returning attendees) and a dynamic environment where new participants join an established network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

Initially, Microconf expanded from one event to two (including one in Europe) and then to three (adding an earlier-stage event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. In a later stage, while Drip was still operating, Microconf expanded to 15 events per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. The focus has always been on building a community, supported by an online community and a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

Austin Rief, co-founder of Morning Brew, highlights the significant role that formal business education, practical work experience, and strategic networking played in his entrepreneurial journey. From his college days at the University of Michigan to navigating the complexities of media sales and building a thriving company, these elements proved crucial for success.

## Early Education and Career Paths
Austin attended the University of Michigan after not getting into Duke, aiming for the biggest school he could access outside of Ivy League institutions or Duke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Initially, he followed the common path at Michigan, gravitating towards finance and Investment Banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This exposure to corporate finance and Investment Banking, including a summer internship, made him realize it was "miserable" and not for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Despite initially downplaying its value, Austin's undergraduate business degree provided him with a fundamental understanding of running a business, including deep dives into accounting and financial models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. This academic background, combined with his Investment Banking summer, was "super helpful to understand what levers you need to pull" in a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

## The Power of Networking and Relationships
Austin's journey with Morning Brew began by stumbling upon Alex Lieberman, who was two years his senior at Michigan, creating a basic PDF newsletter called "Market Corner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This age difference proved pivotal, as it prevented them from raising venture capital too early, forcing them to bootstrap and learn efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Serendipitous Connections
A prime example of the impact of [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | networking and meeting influential people]] is the story of "Wolter" from the Netherlands. Austin connected with Wolter via Twitter after Wolter critiqued a YouTube thumbnail, leading to an invitation into Morning Brew's Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Despite initial confusion about his role, Wolter became a relentlessly effective ad salesperson, single-handedly driving sales for Milk Road through a crypto bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This unexpected connection highlighted the value of open [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | professional network]]s and how [[impact_of_luck_and_preparation_in_business_success | luck]] can intersect with opportunity.

### Navigating the Media Industry
Operating in New York City exposed Morning Brew to the world of media buying and large ad agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This "black box" industry is heavily based on relationships, not just logic or fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Austin recounts a time as a senior in college living in a frat house receiving a million-dollar RFP (Request for Proposal) from the CMO of Discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Learning how to navigate these large-scale deals and agency relationships was a critical part of their growth, demonstrating the importance of understanding the ecosystem and fostering connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Ecosystem
Morning Brew, The Hustle, and The Milk Road, among others, inadvertently created a "tiny little industry of newsletter nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. Austin emphasizes how they hired young, inexperienced individuals with entrepreneurial spirit, promising them an on-the-ground view of starting a business rather than high salaries or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This approach built a strong "crew" where former employees went on to start their own successful ventures, such as Tyler Denk with Beehiiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. This demonstrates the powerful effect of a shared entrepreneurial environment and a [[role_of_talent_and_mentorship_in_business_success | culture of learning]].

## Strategic Mindset and Personal Growth
Austin's operational prowess, characterized by his ability to analyze numbers and focus on key performance indicators (like the "Great Wall of opens" to track email open rates), was a significant asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. He attributes this, in part, to his business education and a competitive drive to learn from those around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

Austin's personal ambition is centered on having the freedom of time, viewing wealth as the ability to spend time as he desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. This goal drives his "maniacally focused" efforts to grow Morning Brew, and illustrates how [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | personal branding and influence]] can open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. His willingness to aggressively pursue goals and constantly learn, even from competitors or new hires, reflects a disciplined approach to both business and personal development.

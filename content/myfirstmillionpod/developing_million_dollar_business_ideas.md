Developing successful business ideas involves a structured research model, often likened to composing a song, where "hooks" or insights lead to a full concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This methodology was used to create The Hustle, which was sold for tens of millions of dollars, and Hampton, predicted to be a huge company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This process is detailed in a course called [[developing_unique_business_ideas | Ideation Bootcamp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Core Research Methodology

The process involves looking for five or six specific elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>:

1.  **Demand:** Constantly seeking out problems people have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Audience Size:** Identifying how many people share that particular problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
3.  **Leaders:** Understanding who the successful leaders are in that space and why they succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
4.  **Shortcomings:** Analyzing the weaknesses or unsolved problems of existing leaders and players in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
5.  **Business Models:** Determining which business models are most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
6.  **Unsolved Problems:** Pinpointing specific problems that are not currently being addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Tools for Research

Several tools can aid in this research:

*   **Similarweb:** A browser plugin that provides guesstimates of website traffic, useful for gauging demand and audience size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It can reveal peak traffic periods, suggesting seasonal demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **AnnualReports.com:** A website for reading public companies' quarterly annual reports, which often contain "insights" or hints about fast-growing segments or challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Company House (UK):** For UK-based companies generating at least £10 million in revenue, their financials are publicly filed, providing transparency into revenue and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This helps in understanding profitable business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Case Studies in Idea Development

### 1800 Flowers Example

While purchasing flowers online, the speaker observed that 1800 Flowers received millions of monthly visitors, peaking in February (Valentine's Day) and May/June (Mother's Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Reading their annual report revealed that succulents were their fastest-growing trend among millennial consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Further analysis of 1800 Flowers' shortcomings indicated:
*   Most revenue came from holidays, and they aimed to increase business between these peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Most profit came from vases, not the flowers themselves, highlighting high margins in accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This research led to the idea of a business that could encourage regular purchases with different vases, focusing on succulents. This concept, shared in a report, inspired companies that launched succulent plants that could stick to walls with hydroponic systems, or businesses creating unique, artist-designed pots and vases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Some of these companies went on to raise millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Heineken and VPN Review Site Examples

*   **Heineken:** Its annual report revealed "Heineken Zero" (non-alcoholic) as the fastest-growing segment, though still small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Such statements from large companies with millions of customers indicate intriguing fast-growing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **VPN Review Site:** Discovering a UK-based company (LTD) reviewing VPNs with 12 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> and £18 million in revenue with £16 million in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This illustrated strong demand for VPN reviews and the profitability of an affiliate business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This discovery broadened thinking to other tech products with high affiliate fees, like payroll software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Building a Team

When [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | building a company]] or making a first hire, the speaker emphasizes being a "collector of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This involves making mental notes of intriguing individuals and fostering connections.

*   **Networking Strategy:**
    *   **Cold Outreach:** Contacting people with a compelling offer like: "The best-case scenario here is that somehow we work together and we create magic. The worst-case scenario is that you have a new friend in the industry and we'll just help one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
    *   **Hosting Events:** Creating opportunities to meet people, such as the "Anti-MBA" book club (started in San Francisco in 2012, running weekly for two years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, or conferences like Hustle Con <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. These events served as a way to build a network and find potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
    *   **Digital Outreach:** DMing people on LinkedIn or Twitter who write compelling posts to initiate contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

## Productized Services: Viral Cuts

Viral Cuts is a company that takes podcast or video footage and chops it up for social media clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. This is an example of a successful productized service, which allows agencies to focus and operationalize services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

Key aspects of its success:
*   **Specialization:** Focusing on a single service (creating clips) rather than a broad agency offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Operationalization:** Developing a strict process for receiving footage, chopping it up, and delivering clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** Initially launched by leveraging partners' social media presence (tweeting it out), leading to seven figures in revenue within 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** Dealing with "headaches" inherent in a people business and potential churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Community Building for Business Growth

Building a great community, such as Hampton (for CEOs with at least $1 million in revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>, is an art form.

Principles for [[advice_on_business_growth_and_investment | creating a great community]]:
1.  **Create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** Implementing a barrier to entry, such as an interview process where most applicants are turned down, makes acceptance more exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
2.  **Foster Intimacy:** Keep groups small (around 250-500 people can become "wonky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>) and create sub-communities within a larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
3.  **Set Norms and Standards:** Define acceptable behaviors, such as encouraging members to "brag" about their achievements to facilitate learning and advice-sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
4.  **Seed the Community:** Initially, invite impressive individuals and even provide them with content to post, creating the appearance of activity and contributing members from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This tactic was famously used by Reddit's founder, Steve Huffman, who posted fake comments under different usernames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.

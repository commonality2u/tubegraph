The discussion delves into personal reflections on regrets and the continuous journey of [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]], offering insights into learning from past experiences and adapting for the future.

## Defining Regret
One host finds the question of "biggest regrets" challenging, distinguishing between actions one would change with hindsight versus true behavioral failings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

True regrets are those instances where one's behavior fell short of personal standards, such as lying, exaggerating, or making selfish moves for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. The test for such actions is whether one would be proud or embarrassed if everyone knew about the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. Identifying and rectifying these instances is key to [[overcoming_personal_and_career_setbacks | overcoming personal and career setbacks]] and fostering [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Behavioral Regrets
> Examples of true behavioral regrets include:
> *   Being condescending to a shuttle driver at 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
> *   An embarrassing encounter with Orlando Bloom involving drunken yelling and an awkward thumb-grab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Reflections on Youth and Missed Opportunities
One host's biggest regret is not taking school, sports, and work more seriously as a young person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. This period, roughly ages 12 to 22, is seen as a crucial time for acquiring skills and excelling in various areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. This also highlights a missed opportunity for [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]] during formative years.

Another host reflects on not fully leveraging opportunities at university, such as connecting with future founders or exploring interesting classes beyond just passing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This is framed more as "if I had the wisdom I have today" rather than a deep regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

## Learning and Growth Philosophy
The importance of continuous learning and hands-on experience is emphasized, using the analogy of "cooking eggs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Merely watching others or consuming advice (like Twitter threads) is likened to "masturbating instead of having sex" â€“ it provides theoretical knowledge but no practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

> [!TIP] Action Over Observation
> Instead of just watching others, one should actively "crack some eggs," make mistakes, and then use advice for "just in time learning" to tweak and adjust what is already being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This active approach is crucial for [[overcoming_personal_and_professional_challenges | overcoming personal and professional challenges]] and building real-world skills.

For [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]] in a career, the ideal is to find a way where one's deepest interests and night-time learning naturally lead to financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. Money becomes a byproduct of pursuing what is most interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

A strategy for rapid skill acquisition involves "packing 20 years of experience into the next four years" by constantly seeking reps in one's field and dedicating nights to building knowledge and skills, such as learning SQL or studying specific industry growth models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

This approach of continuous learning and hands-on application of knowledge is a core principle in [[lessons_from_failures_and_successes | lessons from failures and successes]] and [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]].

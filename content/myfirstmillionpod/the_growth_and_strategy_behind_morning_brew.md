Morning Brew, co-founded by Austin Rief and Alex Liberman, has grown into a substantial media company with an estimated $70-75 million in revenue and a double-digit profit margin, employing around 250 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Founding Story
Morning Brew began as "Market Corner," a PDF attached to an email, started by Alex Liberman while he was in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Austin Rief, who was two years younger than Alex and also attending the University of Michigan, stumbled upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Both Rief and Liberman initially pursued careers in finance, with Liberman working at Morgan Stanley and Rief interning in investment banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Rief decided to pursue Morning Brew full-time after finding his banking experience "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

> [!info] Avoiding Venture Capital
> The decision not to pursue venture capital in 2015 was largely due to Rief being a sophomore in college, which made it difficult to secure funding at a time when companies like BuzzFeed and Vice were raising significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This forced Morning Brew to be extremely lean and focused on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, prioritizing every penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>.

Initial subscriber acquisition involved scrappy tactics, such as Rief personally collecting emails in large college lecture halls at the University of Michigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He would stand in front of students, staring them down until they provided their email addresses, which he would then manually type in, sometimes with "six permutations of every single email" to ensure capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This method helped them acquire 10,000-15,000 subscribers at Michigan, and they expanded this model to other colleges like Penn State, Miami, and NYU, reaching around 50,000 college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## Business Model and Strategic Growth
Morning Brew's business model heavily relies on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. They navigated the ad sales landscape, starting with direct response ads from companies like Casper and Away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Later, they tapped into the New York City media buying world, securing large brand budgets from major companies like Discover, with early deals reaching a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

> [!quote] The Black Box of Media Buying
> Austin Rief describes the world of media buying and large ad agencies as a "black box" that is intentionally complex to keep outsiders from entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This industry operates on relationships rather than pure logic or fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, with companies incentivized to spend money by the end of their budget cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Large brands pay for audience and relationship building, not necessarily direct purchases, aiming to improve perception among millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

Morning Brew pursued a "horizontal" growth strategy by launching multiple newsletters focused on different niches, which helped them grow revenue faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This contrasted with The Hustle's "verticalization" strategy, which focused on services like subscriptions and events like HustleCon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Morning Brew's general business content made it difficult to launch specific subscriptions or events, leading them to embrace a B2B media approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This involved launching niche newsletters that were profitable even before hiring writers, by pre-selling ad placements to B2B SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Rief's framework for newsletter categories includes:
*   **Editorial Newsletters:** Long-form content from individual writers (e.g., Substackers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Aggregation Newsletters:** General business content aiming for scale (e.g., early Morning Brew and The Hustle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **"Morning Brew for X":** Aggregation of summaries for a specific niche, with a smaller total addressable market (TAM) but a higher potential percentage of that TAM reading the product due to unique tone and coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This approach is considered the biggest opportunity, especially in growing industries or B2B professional sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. For consumer audiences, it should target high-dollar segments like "Ferrari owners" or "Rolex owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

## Operational Excellence and Competitive Mindset
Morning Brew's early days were characterized by a relentless focus on core metrics. The team would print out both Morning Brew and The Hustle every morning and go line-by-line to compare content, driving internal competition and a desire to "crush" their rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Their core strategy was encapsulated by the phrase "write, grow, sell," written on their office wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. They also had a "Great Wall of Opens" where they tracked their daily open rates for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

Austin Rief possesses a strong operational and financial acumen, which he attributes to his undergraduate business degree and a summer in investment banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. This background helped him understand P&Ls, financial models, and the levers to pull to drive business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the core metrics, stating that many founders fail because they don't know "the main thing" for their business, or how to translate it into daily actions and measurable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Understanding Business Drivers
> Rief highlights the simplicity of their financial model: "if we grow subs 50,000 every single month and our costs don't change, we're gonna go from 50,000 monthly revenue to 75 to 100 to 125" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>. Their low cost structure, primarily composed of people, growth marketing, and an email service provider (ESP), made this growth highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.

## Acquisition and Personal Impact
Morning Brew sold a majority portion of the business at approximately a $70 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Rief views this as a strategic move to take "half your chips off the table," securing life-changing money while retaining enough upside to remain motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>. The sale, which occurred during COVID-19, was "unbelievably anticlimactic," with Rief receiving the wire transfer while living in his childhood bedroom at his parents' house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.

This early success provided Rief with significant "swagger" and confidence, allowing him to access new opportunities and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>. He invests the majority of his wealth conservatively in "boring stuff" like the S&P 500, Vanguard funds, and real estate, with smaller allocations to crypto and venture investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>. His approach to wealth is informed by the concept of a "rich life" focusing on experiences and time rather than excessive material possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>.

## Company Culture and Future Outlook
Morning Brew fostered a culture of hiring young, inexperienced individuals with entrepreneurial drive, pitching them the opportunity to be "in on the ground floor" of a growing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>. They operated very leanly, even requiring employees to bring their own computers and initially not offering health care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. They regularly engaged in manual tasks like packing envelopes for their referral program, sitting down together for several hours every Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. This environment has produced a "crew" of successful individuals who have gone on to build other notable ventures, such as Tyler Denk, who started Beehiiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

Rief's personal philosophy revolves around time as the ultimate wealth, desiring the freedom to spend his time as he chooses, including extensive travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a>. He remains "maniacally focused" on growing Morning Brew due to its continued opportunity for 10x growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:00">[58:50:00]</a>. Looking ahead, he envisions a "barbell" approach to his career: either passive income with minimal work or going "Allin" on a venture with the potential for "multiple billions" in valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

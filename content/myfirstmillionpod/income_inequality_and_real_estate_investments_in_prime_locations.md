Income inequality is a growing concern, with a small cohort of individuals, described as "transnational oligarchs," accumulating exponentially more wealth than the rest of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. This group, representing approximately the 0.01% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>, increasingly lacks a vested interest in the health of their host nations, democracy, or the rule of law because they effectively operate under their own system of rules and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

> The number of millionaires in the United States has doubled since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. The number of billionaires has increased from 500 to 2,500 in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

## Investment Strategy: Targeting "Super Cities"

Given this trend, one investment strategy involves acquiring real estate in locations where these ultra-wealthy individuals desire to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Billionaires typically gravitate towards a select few global cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>:
*   Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   Palm Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   Aspen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>

Other notable locations include Los Angeles and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. The strategy involves owning residential properties in these "super cities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, which serve as future homes for billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.

### Advantages of Real Estate in Prime Locations
*   **Limited Supply** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>: There is no more beachfront real estate in Palm Beach, Manhattan is constrained, Aspen is difficult to develop, and London is similarly limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. This scarcity provides an "unnatural lift" to real estate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.
*   **Store of Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>: These properties serve as a reliable means of preserving wealth.
*   **Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>: Real estate is one of the few [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | investments]] that can be leveraged at a 5:1 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Depreciation Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>: Properties can be depreciated for tax purposes (2-3% annually) even if their market value is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Mental Wellness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>: Unlike volatile stock market [[Investment and retail market trends | investments]], real estate is not marked daily, reducing stress from constant monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. For example, rental units in Delray Beach are not constantly valued, avoiding the emotional impact of daily market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **Psychic Benefit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>: Owning attractive properties in desirable locations can encourage family members to visit, offering a social and personal return beyond financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

The speaker recommends residential rental real estate as a wise investment, particularly when considering [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | long-term wealth building]] and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. They suggest that if they had to start over, they would invest all excess cash flow into massively diversified ETFs globally and increasingly into residential rental real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

## Context of "Unsexy" Investments

This strategy aligns with a broader philosophy that "the sexier an investment, the lower the returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Distressed investing, though often considered unsexy or ugly, can yield significantly higher returns compared to more glamorous ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This principle also extends to [[understanding_wealth_and_opportunity | human capital]]: careers in less romantic, "unsexy" industries often offer greater financial returns for comparable talent levels than highly desirable fields like arts or entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

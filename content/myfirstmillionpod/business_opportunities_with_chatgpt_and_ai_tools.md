The emergence of AI technology, particularly [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Generative AI]], represents the "single largest opportunity" and biggest tech paradigm shift since the internet [00:00:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This shift is considered an order of magnitude bigger than the mobile revolution, which, while significant, had a more discrete set of use cases [00:00:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. AI's impact is broad, opening opportunities across all industries and types of businesses, for both startups and incumbents [00:30:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.

## The Transformative Power of Generative AI

ChatGPT, a prominent example of [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Generative AI]], has garnered over 100 million users in just two months [00:26:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is considered a top contender for becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world, potentially worth a trillion dollars or more in the next 10 years [00:02:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The development of large language models is highly capital-intensive, making access to funding crucial [00:05:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

While many discussions around [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Generative AI]] focus on text-to-text (e.g., writing blog posts) or text-to-image generation (e.g., DALL-E 2, Midjourney), a less discussed but highly impactful use case is text-to-code [00:10:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This capability allows users to describe a desired outcome in natural language, and the AI generates the necessary code to achieve it [00:10:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Chat UX and Declarative Models

This text-to-code capability leads to a new form of user experience called "chat UX" or chat-based user experience for software [00:10:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Unlike traditional software that requires step-by-step "imperative" instructions (clicks, drags, touches), natural language enables a "declarative" model [00:11:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Users simply describe the desired result, and the software handles the intermediate steps [00:11:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

This paradigm shift means that the primary requirement for using software is no longer knowing how to code or use specific software, but rather knowing a language (like English) and understanding what outcome you want [00:12:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. For example, a user could ask for a report showing subscribers broken down by geography in a CRM like HubSpot, without needing to know the specific reporting tool's interface [00:12:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. AI can even troubleshoot issues with other products, demonstrating its reasoning capabilities beyond simple auto-completion [00:14:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Conversational AI and Memory

Modern AI models are conversational, allowing for multi-step dialogues [00:15:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. If generated code is broken or a query produces an error, users can provide feedback, and the AI will apologize and attempt to correct it, demonstrating a "memory" of the context [00:16:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Users can also reverse roles, asking the AI to pose questions to guide them to the desired outcome [00:16:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Plugins and Ecosystems

OpenAI is enabling plugins for ChatGPT, transforming it from a standalone chat app into a chat ecosystem [00:27:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. This is analogous to the App Store for iPhone, allowing third-party developers to integrate their services and proprietary data sources directly into the ChatGPT experience [00:27:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This means ChatGPT could, for example, book travel arrangements via Expedia or Airbnb plugins, or manage CRM data in Salesforce [00:43:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This shift allows AI to not just answer questions but to "do things" [00:43:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

### Semantic Search and [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Vector Embeddings]]

Beyond traditional keyword-based or faceted searches, [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Generative AI]] enables "semantic search" through [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Vector Embeddings]] [00:33:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Vector Embeddings]] convert text (like paragraphs or tweets) into numerical points in a multi-dimensional space, allowing for the calculation of "semantic distance" or how related two concepts are, even if they use different words [00:32:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries currently relying on crude keyword matching [00:33:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. For example, in a community, it could match members based on shared "founder therapy level issues" or nuanced struggles, rather than just industry or geography [00:34:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This allows for matching based on inferred meaning, not just explicit statements [00:37:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. Companies specializing in [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Vector Embeddings]] databases, like Pinecone, are raising significant funding [00:40:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

## [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities|AI Business Ideas and Opportunities]]

AI is seen as an "amplifying force for human ability," creating new jobs and net value, similar to how computers transformed the workforce [00:20:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This moment is comparable to the early days of the internet or Amazon, offering a high chance of building something successful due to the "tidal wave" of opportunity [00:29:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### New Skills and Roles

**Prompt engineering** is an emerging skill analogous to software engineering, focused on crafting effective prompts to guide large language models like GPT-4 to produce desired outputs [01:11:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This presents an [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities|opportunity]] for technology-minded individuals who are strong writers or analysts but not traditional software engineers [01:12:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

### Strategic Investments

Darmesh Shah, co-founder of HubSpot, personally invested in the domain "chat.com" for over $10 million, viewing "chat as an experience, as an interface, is the future" [00:46:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. He also acquired "prompt.com" for a seven-figure sum, indicating a belief in the future of prompt engineering [01:12:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. These investments are seen as "the price of admission" to the AI space [00:57:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

### [[building_a_business_using_ai_tools|Building a Business Using AI Tools]]

There is a significant [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities|opportunity]] to intersect existing business models with AI developments [01:00:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. For example, a community-building business could integrate [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact|Vector Embeddings]] to match members based on nuanced needs, creating an "unstoppable force" [01:01:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

HubSpot is developing "ChatSpot," an application that uses OpenAI's APIs to provide a chat-based interface for accessing HubSpot data, analytics, and other external services [00:48:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This project demonstrates [[utilizing_ai_in_daily_business_operations|utilizing AI in daily business operations]] and is set to change the CRM world [00:49:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_potential_of_ai_technology|Challenges and Potential of AI Technology]]

While many are optimistic, some prominent figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman express concerns about AI's potential dangers, suggesting it could be the "most dangerous technology" ever invented or lead to devastating outcomes in the wrong hands [00:21:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This includes fears of AI optimizing for goals that might put humans in the way, or its use in malicious applications [00:22:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

However, the general consensus is that AI, like previous technological advancements, will create more net value for the world, even if it eliminates some existing jobs [00:21:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

There is also a caution against being an "AI tourist" or "grifter" who merely seeks quick arbitrage opportunities [01:15:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. The real [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities|opportunity]] lies in solving genuine problems and creating lasting value with the technology [01:15:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

Additionally, the rapid pace of AI development means that many new AI tools and features can quickly become obsolete as foundational models like GPT are updated or absorb those features directly [01:03:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This highlights the importance of building on a solid foundation and understanding the underlying technology [01:02:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

## Personal Approach to AI Exploration

A hands-on approach, such as dedicating "AI week" to "mess around with AI tools," is emphasized as an effective way to learn and discover [[ai_business_ideas|AI business ideas]] [00:06:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This involves experimenting with tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and OpenAI's Whisper (for transcription) to understand their capabilities and limitations [00:07:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

For example, a process was detailed for turning a podcast into a structured database of ideas using Whisper for transcription and ChatGPT for summarizing and tagging [01:08:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. This approach aims to replace existing work with more efficient AI workflows and explore "fun random" applications [01:11:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.# Business Opportunities with ChatGPT and AI Tools

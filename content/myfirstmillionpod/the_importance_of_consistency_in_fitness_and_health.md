The speaker emphasizes that achieving fitness and health goals, particularly as an entrepreneur, hinges on unwavering consistency and the establishment of clear, non-negotiable rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. This approach aims to reduce decision fatigue and ensure long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle.

## Personal Journey and Transformation

The speaker shares their personal [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle | transformation]] from being an exceptional high school athlete in Missouri (200m and 400m dash) and a Division One scholarship athlete, to becoming "fat" and "lumpy" between the ages of 20 and 28 after quitting sports to pursue business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. About three or four years prior to the discussion, they made a decisive change to get "pretty fit," even jokingly aiming to become a "fitness model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Consistency

Inspired by General Mattis and Ryan Holiday, the speaker adopted the principle of "flat ass rules" to avoid exhaustion and burnout from making daily decisions about health choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

### Unwavering Commitment
The central rule established by the speaker around age 28 or 29 was: "I will never ever ever miss a workout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. This commitment to [[the_importance_of_persistence_and_selfbelief | consistency]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

*   **Workout Schedule**: Workouts are performed five days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   **Adherence Rate**: In the last two to three years, they've missed only 5 to 10 workouts per year, typically due to sickness or unavoidable events like a funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This translates to missing less than 5% of planned workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Measures**: Even during road trips, if a morning workout is missed, the speaker pulls over at a truck stop for an hour to complete exercises using resistance bands, push-ups, burpees, and sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

### Setting Specific, Focused Goals
Goals are set quarterly and are highly specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. This aligns with the principle of [[the_importance_of_focused_life_goals_and_seasons | focused life goals]].

*   **Examples of Goals**:
    *   Bench press 330 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
    *   Squat 430 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
    *   Achieve NFL receiver combine averages: 4.5 40-yard dash, 34-inch vertical, 10.4 broad jump, and bench pressing 225 pounds 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Goal Pursuit**: While not every goal is always hit, there is always a clear target to strive for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision and Support
The speaker's long-term fitness focus is primarily on weightlifting, driven by the desire to live to 130 and the strong correlation between muscle mass and longevity (e.g., stronger bones, ability to recover from falls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. Additionally, the speaker admits a vain motivation: "look good naked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

To support this [[rob_dyrdeks_approach_to_health_wellness_and_longevity | health and wellness approach]]:

*   **Professional Training**: A trainer, Jesse O'Brien at Central Athlete, creates monthly remote workout programs, which the speaker follows without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This costs approximately $300 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
*   **Nutrition Coaching**: My Body Tutor, a nutritionist service, provides weekly check-ins to maintain diet adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. This costs around $250 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Tracking**: Workouts are tracked in an app to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. All food intake is meticulously recorded to prevent overeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

## Anticipated Roadblocks

The speaker acknowledges that having a child, with their partner currently pregnant, is commonly cited as a significant roadblock to fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. However, they are in a fortunate position to hire help like a night nurse and express confidence that while it will be more challenging, it will not prevent their commitment to fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

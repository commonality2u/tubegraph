The landscape for monetizing audiences has evolved significantly beyond traditional advertising or sponsorships. A major opportunity exists in partnering with content creators to build or buy businesses for them, allowing them to earn equity rather than just ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This approach leverages the content creator's audience as an "unfair distribution advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

The premise is that the current model of content creator monetization through ad reads or sponsorships is in its "toddler stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. In the future, the money content creators make from equity in businesses they own will "massively dwarf" what they earn from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## The Partnership Model

The challenge for many content creators is that they don't want to risk capital or start and run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This creates an opening for entrepreneurs to step in. The proposed model involves:
*   **Finding creators with audiences** who have high trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Building or buying the "perfect product"** for that creator, something they can organically use and talk about for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **An operator or CEO running the business**, while splitting equity with the content creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

This low-risk proposition for creators can lead to "nine-figure exits" over four or five years, even for audiences of a moderate size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. The core thesis is that these audiences are "super underpriced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This concept also extends to niche YouTubers, who can sell more expensive products or engage in multiple ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. It's anticipated that every person with an audience will eventually have a "really tightly integrated organic product to sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Implementations

This model is already gaining traction:
*   **Joe Rogan** partnered with Onnit, a company that was later sold for substantial money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Doug DeMuro** created Cars & Bids, an online auction platform for cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Tiny**, the company Jeremy worked for, acquired a yerba mate company (Matina) for **Huberman**, who loves mate and has organically promoted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   Tiny also built "Habits Right," an app for **James Clear**, author of *Atomic Habits*, as an alternative to ad reads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Congo Brands** approached [[Logan Paul]] and [[KSI]] to launch Prime, an energy drink. Logan Paul and KSI became the promotion engine, receiving significant equity, while Congo Brands handled the operational backend, aiming for a billion-dollar-plus company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   The **Turn Group** has successfully applied this with Doug DeMuro and Stephen Rinella (for hunting-related content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

### Why Creator-Owned Products are Better than Merchandise

Jeremy opines that current creator-backed products like MrBeast's chocolate bars (Feastables) or Prime are "bad businesses" in terms of underlying fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. While they can be successful due to audience leverage, they are typically low-margin, lack repeat customers, and aren't super necessary products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. In contrast, businesses like home insurance or a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company offer higher margins and more essential services. The true test of a good creator-backed business is its "enduring enterprise value" without the creator directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. For example, a bank built with hundreds of thousands of customers could survive if the creator stepped away, unlike a chocolate bar brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This highlights that while current [[Business opportunities on TikTok|creator-led ventures]] are working on "hard mode," the potential for even more valuable businesses is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

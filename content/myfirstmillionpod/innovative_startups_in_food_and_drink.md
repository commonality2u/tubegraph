The food and drink industry, particularly the restaurant sector, has seen significant shifts and [[innovative_ideas_in_diverse_industries | innovative ideas]] spurred by recent global changes and technological advancements. This includes leveraging digital tools for optimization and rethinking how sensory perception influences taste.

## Restaurant Menu Optimization
The shift of many restaurants to online menus, often accessed via QR codes, has opened new avenues for [[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startup_growth | marketing strategies]] and optimization, similar to e-commerce platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Need for A/B Testing Software
Despite the widespread use of digital menus, many restaurants are not A/B testing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
A significant opportunity exists for a software solution that allows restaurants to easily A/B test their menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This software could integrate with existing Point of Sale (POS) systems to generate reports on menu performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Internet companies like Google, Netflix, and Amazon have used A/B testing extensively to optimize their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This concept can be directly applied to restaurant menus.

### Psychology of Menu Design
Physical menu design has long utilized human psychology to influence customer choices. Michelle Banesh, a woman whose job involves redesigning physical menus, was able to help one restaurant generate an additional nine dollars per customer simply by altering the orientation and order of items on their menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This demonstrates the significant impact that menu presentation can have on revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

With QR code menus, restaurants can now easily experiment with menu design without needing to print new physical copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The goal is to apply "landing page design" principles to menus to achieve higher conversion rates and increase average customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Early A/B Testing in Online-Only Restaurants
An early example of menu A/B testing involved a delivery-only sushi restaurant startup, which was a precursor to modern "cloud kitchens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. With an entirely online menu, they could run tests to see what made people order more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

*   **Pricing**: Influenced by economist Dan Ariely's book *Predictably Irrational*, they tested raising prices by 50% on one menu. Surprisingly, the higher-priced menu saw a higher conversion rate, netting more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Ariely noted that people are "predictably irrational" and may associate higher prices with higher quality, especially for items like sushi or wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Descriptions**: Adding descriptive words to menu items, such as "Alaskan salmon hand caught" instead of just "salmon," led to increased orders, even though the product itself was unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Optimizing Delivery Platform Listings
The concept of menu optimization can extend to listings on delivery platforms like DoorDash and Uber Eats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A service that optimizes these listings with better photos, menus, and copy could be highly valuable for national chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

One [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | startup idea]] involved creating "shadow brands" or clones of existing local restaurants on delivery apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This involved:
*   Developing catchy, more marketable names (e.g., "Choo Choo Chinese" for a Chinese restaurant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Using bright, appealing photos and trimming down extensive menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Writing better copy and focusing on popular items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   Orders placed through these rebranded listings would go to the original restaurant, which would then package them in the new brand's packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
This strategy allowed restaurants to gain an additional 30% revenue by better marketing on platforms like Postmates, Uber Eats, and DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Novel Food and Drink Products
[[Innovative consumer products in beauty and wellness | Innovative consumer products]] are emerging that aim to make food and drink healthier without compromising on taste by leveraging sensory science.

### Salty Bowls and Chopsticks
Kirin (k-i-r-i-n), a Japanese company, partnered with a university to develop bowls and chopsticks that use a weak electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. This current, through ionization, makes food taste saltier, allowing consumers to enjoy salty flavors while consuming less sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

### Smelly Water
Air Up is a company that developed a scented ring placed around a bottle's lip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. When a person drinks, the scent from the ring creates the perception of flavor (e.g., citrus) even though the water itself is unflavored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Air Up reportedly raised $68 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. This demonstrates a trend of making food and drink taste good without changing the caloric content or ingredient intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

## Regulatory Changes in Food and Health
The FDA (or similar organizations in Canada) is rethinking the traditional food pyramid, which previously emphasized grains as foundational and limited fats like those found in nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. This reevaluation of dietary guidelines will impact how foods can be labeled as "healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Such changes are expected to generate new content and shifts within the food industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

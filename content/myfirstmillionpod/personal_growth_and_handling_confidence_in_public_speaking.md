## Obsession and Effort in Personal Development

Mr. Beast describes his intense work ethic as waking up, obsessing over something, going to bed, and repeating the cycle until he experiences a mental breakdown or burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. He takes a day or a day and a half off, then immediately returns to this rigorous schedule, exerting "every ounce of [his] entire body until [he] just crash[es]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">00:00:15</a>. This approach highlights an extreme form of [[personal_development_and_growth|personal development]] and dedication.

## Navigating Public Speaking and Confidence

During a podcast recording with Mr. Beast and Hasan Minhaj, the host admitted to being nervous, describing the experience as "a big deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">00:01:33</a>. Hasan Minhaj, a comedian, noted that comedians typically possess a high level of "self-deprecation and self-awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">00:12:59</a>. He shared the concept that "comedy is low status game," meaning one starts from a low status position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">00:13:30</a>. This approach encourages empathy from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">00:13:40</a>. Owning one's low status or vulnerability can resonate with people, as demonstrated by examples shared during an icebreaker activity where participants revealed embarrassing or "low status" facts about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">00:14:00</a>.

Mr. Beast, despite his immense success, openly stated that he is "still trying to get confident speaking in front of large groups of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">00:15:25</a>. He also shared that he was not confident as a kid due to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">00:15:10</a>. This illustrates that even highly successful individuals can face [[overcoming_personal_and_professional_challenges|personal challenges]] related to confidence.

## Mr. Beast's Unwavering Self-Belief

Mr. Beast attributes his lack of doubt to the significant effort his team invests: spending "20 [to] 30 times longer thinking of ideas," filming "10 times more," and spending "100 times" more money per video than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">00:11:05</a>. He believes in his work because of this effort, stating that his "doubt" knob is "set to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">00:10:57</a>.

### Childhood and Early Career

Mr. Beast started making videos at age 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">00:08:35</a>. He was "horrible" in school, never taking his books home, and would often throw them under bleachers, picking them up only in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">00:08:18</a>. His first videos from age 13 are still available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">00:08:53</a>, though earlier ones were deleted due to embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">00:08:48</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred when he was around 10, learning that a Call of Duty YouTuber made $100,000 a year, which was more than his mother earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">00:29:26</a>. This revelation fueled his determination to become a YouTuber, stating he didn't care if he "die[d]" trying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">00:29:42</a>.

### The Power of Obsession and Standing Out

Mr. Beast emphasizes the changing perception of obsession. While growing up, he was called a "loser nerd" for being too obsessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">00:30:08</a>, it is now seen as an inspiring positive quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">00:30:19</a>. He believes that from adulthood, the goal shifts from fitting in to standing out, and that "standing out has been the game the whole time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">00:31:18</a>. He advises letting one's obsession guide them, as it leads to a unique path that others won't copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">00:31:23</a>. He stresses that "following your obsession is like the thing to do in life" and that hedging one's bets by only half-trying can hinder success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">00:31:41</a>.

## Continuous Learning and Creative Inspiration

Mr. Beast believes one must "always be learning" to generate original ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">00:23:52</a>. He pays people to teach him new things and make him aware of information he might not know, ensuring he's always "in taking inspiration from different places" like podcasts, books, or random knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">00:24:52</a>. This continuous learning process helps him "expand [his] knowledge well in [his] head with new things that can draw inspiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">00:25:59</a>.

He looks up to creators like Steven Spielberg, who he considers one of the greatest storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">00:27:37</a>. He particularly admires how Steve Jobs built Pixar into a multi-billion dollar company from a non-hardware and more creative, storytelling foundation, highlighting the "power that one individual had" despite the large scale of the companies involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">00:22:57</a>. This demonstrates the "power of having good vision and just not relenting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">00:23:40</a>.

## Company Culture and Pursuit of Excellence

Mr. Beast's company produces videos with an average cost of around $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">00:32:36</a>. He strives to "make the greatest YouTube videos possible" and will not upload a video if it's not "the greatest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">00:19:14</a>. He considers sticking to a strict upload schedule foolish if the video quality is subpar, sometimes going two months without uploading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">00:33:41</a>.

His employees describe working with him as a source of "crazy" experiences and opportunities for unique stunts and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">00:18:17</a>. The main challenge for employees is the lack of a predictable routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">00:18:30</a>. For other business ventures like his snack brand and Beast Burger, he hires "the best in the goddamn world at their job" and empowers them with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">00:21:02</a>. He currently has about 60 people working in his studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">00:21:10</a>.

Sarah Moore, a remarkable entrepreneur, has become an inspiration for her ability to acquire a multi-million dollar business with no money down, despite having no prior experience or capital beyond her car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Her story highlights that [[building_a_startup_with_zero_funding | starting a business]] or acquiring one can be achieved through sheer hustle, a numbers game, and unconventional strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

## Why Buy a Business?
While traditionally focused on [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting businesses]], the path of buying an existing business can often be a better route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For Sarah, the idea of a "search fund" was particularly appealing: it allows an individual to buy a business and become its CEO, potentially without money or prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This path offered a stark contrast to the perceived "enslavement" of traditional corporate roles like banking or consulting, which she viewed as brain drains for talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Her motivation was rooted in a desire for freedom and self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## The Search Process: A Numbers Game

Sarah's approach to finding a business was systematic and volume-based, rather than relying on deep industry expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Initial Challenges & Overcoming Them
Despite having an MBA from Harvard, Sarah lacked the practical skills to evaluate small businesses, as corporate-focused education doesn't teach how to analyze commercial window washing financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. She initially considered the investor route, where investors pay you to search for a business. However, the requirement to pay back 1.5 times the amount given (e.g., $300K for $200K) was deemed "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

She decided to go it alone, convinced that by gaining "enough reps" in evaluating businesses, she would instinctively recognize a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Data Acquisition and Filtering
Sarah's first step was to leverage her network, asking a friend to scrape a database of all private companies within an hour and a half of her Boston apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These databases were often inaccurate (only about 50% accurate for owner names, revenues, or employee counts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

She filtered out businesses based on revenue (anything over $100 million) and obvious industries (legal, accounting, 7-Eleven) but otherwise kept the list broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Industry is Overrated
> Sarah's experience taught her that industry is irrelevant when looking for a business to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. What truly matters is finding a business that is **established and has been consistently profitable for a number of years** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. She cites examples like pest control (a "great industry") vs. steel industry (thought to be a "hell no business") to demonstrate that stability comes from consistent profitability, not the industry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

### Building a Team and Outreach Strategy
As a college student with no money, Sarah initially hired five unpaid interns, primarily found through Craigslist (not cookie-cutter student job boards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. She pitched the opportunity as real private equity experience, offering transparency by allowing interns to listen in on calls with owners, brokers, accountants, and attorneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

Her outreach strategy evolved into a "bombs away" mass emailing approach. Realizing the response rate was low regardless of customization, they created an Excel file with common email patterns (e.g., firstname.lastname@domain.com) and used a bulk email checker to verify addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. The emails were designed to look customized, stating "I'm looking for a business to buy and yours seems to perfectly fit the bill because it's within this revenue range, it's been around for a really long time, and it's been profitable for a number of years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This approach effectively made recipients "fill out her survey" by either correcting her or confirming her assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

Her target criteria initially included businesses with $4 million to $20 million in revenue and at least $1.5 million in profit, but these figures became more flexible over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

## Acquiring Eggcartons.com

One of the businesses that responded to her mass email was Eggcartons.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The owner's detailed, impressed response stood out, as did the business's consistent profitability since 2001 and strong customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### The Business Model
Eggcartons.com is a wholesale distributor that buys, stores, and sells egg cartons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. Its simplicity appealed to Sarah, who felt she could understand and operate it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. The business also had proprietary products and patents that made it more desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Sarah specifically sought out "boring businesses" that were old-school and didn't rely on technology, playing to her limited technical abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### The "No Money Down" Mechanism
To acquire the business without putting any cash down, Sarah relied on a **seller's note** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

> [!INFO] Seller's Note Explained
> A seller's note is a form of financing where the seller acts as the bank. Instead of receiving the full purchase price upfront, the buyer pays a portion at closing (e.g., 75%) and the remaining balance (e.g., 25%) is paid over time, with agreed-upon terms and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. This means the seller has a vested interest in the business's continued success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

Sarah structured the deal with a 25% seller's note and a 75% bank note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. The key was finding banks (which took over 20 attempts) that viewed the seller's note as equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This allowed her to secure financing without personal capital, as the bank's loan had priority over the seller's note and was primarily backed by the business's long track record of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

Crucially, Sarah avoided jargon and complex deal structures (like earnouts) to maintain trust and clarity with the seller, many of whom might not have formal business education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Growth and Lessons Learned

Initially, Sarah admits she made mistakes, and the business saw a slight decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. However, she soon realized that Eggcartons.com wasn't just in the "egg industry" but in **specialty packaging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. By analyzing order history, she discovered customers buying cartons for crickets, roaches, small parts, bath bombs, and cupcakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. An estimated 40% of their revenue now has nothing to do with eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

> [!TIP] Identify the True Market
> Sarah's motto: "Anything requiring protection and separation is fair game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. This broadened their market significantly beyond just eggs. She's now acquiring domain names like "machine shop trays" and "bath bomb cartons" to reflect this broader scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

The business experienced massive growth (5-6x) during COVID-19, which Sarah describes as "cheating" due to increased demand for packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Her focus on proprietary products and custom molds created "sticky" customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### Advice for New Owners
Sarah's key advice for new business owners, particularly from her own mistakes:
1.  **Hire and fire fast**: A crucial lesson learned from her mentor that she initially failed to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.
2.  **Do not change anything big or really anything at all in the first year**: Tempting as it is to implement new ideas, even seemingly small changes like phone systems can lead to major disruptions (e.g., losing phone lines for a week, causing customers to think the business closed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

## Sarah's Unconventional Background and Mentality

Sarah's story is particularly inspiring due to her challenging upbringing. She grew up with absent parents, bounced between homes, and was in and out of jail as a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. A turning point came when a foster family, the Brackens, taught her basic life principles and invested in her future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. She later paid her sister to take her SATs because she lacked confidence in her own academic preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. Her low reading level at the start of college (33rd percentile) and a factual assessment of "below average" intelligence fueled her determination to study relentlessly, fearing only disappointment to those who believed in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

Her journey instilled several powerful lessons and a unique mentality:

*   **Overcoming Self-Doubt**: Despite her background, she refused to "count herself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **The "Will or Won't" Mindset**: Buying a business is not about "can or can't," but "will or won't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. Anyone with enough effort and "elbow grease" can achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
*   **Ignorance is Bliss**: Not knowing traditional finance jargon can be an advantage, allowing for simple, straightforward communication with sellers that fosters trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **[[bootstrapping_a_billion_dollar_business | Hustle]] and Unconventional Methods**:
    *   Wearing 5-inch heels and loud outfits to broker events to be memorable ("that extremely tall chick") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>.
    *   Wearing a "I want to buy your business" sweatshirt with her number while biking around Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
    *   Mass faxing businesses with her picture, understanding that traditional businesses still use fax machines and it's an "untapped, unsaturated channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.
    *   Leveraging her gender as a minority in a male-dominated industry to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
*   **"Do It for the Story"**: Embracing unconventional ideas, regardless of immediate results, signals an "all in" mentality to oneself and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.
*   **"Be That One Person for One Person"**: Inspired by the families who invested in her, Sarah is passionate about one-on-one mentorship, bringing people to the "next level" and refusing to give up on those who try and are honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

Sarah's journey demonstrates that **freedom** is her biggest value, and it can be achieved by using all available resources (gender, age, background) to pull oneself up by the bootstraps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. This path, though requiring time and effort, can lead to financial independence without the need for extensive capital or a "Harvard MBA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. It's about applying lessons from the "School of Hard Knocks" to find and acquire opportunities that are overlooked by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

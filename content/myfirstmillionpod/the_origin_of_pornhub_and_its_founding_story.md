The adult entertainment industry, particularly its online segment, has been described as a "Game of Thrones" in the tech world. This analogy suggests that while many desire to control the most powerful assets, ownership is often short-lived due to intense competition and inherent challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This dynamic perfectly illustrates the tumultuous journey of Pornhub's ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## The Pre-YouTube Era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>

Before 2005, the internet adult entertainment landscape was dominated by directory sites, similar to early Yahoo! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These sites would provide lists of links to other websites, mostly for photos, rather than hosting content directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

A major shift occurred with the launch of YouTube in 2005, which simplified online video hosting and aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This innovation spurred "copycats" in the adult industry, such as RedTube and YouPorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. These new platforms offered a 10x better experience: they were more private, instantaneous, provided infinite variety and niches, and most importantly, were free, unlike the prevalent paid content model of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. However, these early video sites were largely flooded with pirated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

At this time, the "King of Porn" was Vivid Entertainment, a company that produced adult films in a Hollywood studio style, with people purchasing DVDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. With the rise of free video sites, Vivid's revenue plummeted by 50% to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Vivid attempted to counter this by suing the new platforms, mirroring Viacom's legal actions against YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Pornhub's Genesis: From Foosball to Filth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>

The story of Pornhub's founding begins with three Canadian college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. They initially met at a competitive foosball tournament, where the "Chief Nerd" and best programmer among them, Matthew Keizer, developed a live-streaming video website to broadcast their foosball matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. While the foosball audience was small, Keizer realized his video technology could be adapted for adult content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

These founders initially created around 100 directory-style link sites, similar to Juggworld.com, but they observed the success of YouTube and decided to create their own video-hosting platform to retain traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. In the same office, they launched Pornhub as the platform and simultaneously created Brazzers, their own content production studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. This dual operation was kept secret, making it appear that Brazzers and Pornhub were separate, even rival, entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

Pornhub's growth was explosive, described as taking off "like a rocket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. The founders worked tirelessly, sleeping in the office, and bootstrapping the company without external investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. A key to their success was Keizer's expertise in SEO, which allowed Pornhub to achieve the number one ranking for "porn" and "sex" on Google, outmaneuvering competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Their ownership of Brazzers content also provided a significant advantage, as they had a constant supply of original content that wasn't subject to copyright takedowns, unlike their rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

## Growth, Roll-ups, and the Burden of the Throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>

The company scaled rapidly, growing from three friends to 250 employees by 2009, generating millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. They appointed one of the founders' brothers as CEO, who began a private equity-style roll-up, acquiring smaller, vulnerable sites afraid of lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This consolidation created a "Mega Behemoth" that could better withstand legal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. Notably, even sophisticated players, like a Stanford MBA student whose mother helped him raise money for a leveraged buyout, were involved in these acquisitions within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

Despite their success, the founders grew increasingly "paranoid" about holding such a prominent position in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. They faced serious threats, including the U.S. government seizing $9 million from one of their bank accounts, leading them to move money around and hire 24/7 security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. The stress eventually led Matthew Keizer, the SEO savant, to quit, walking away from significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

## The First Sale and Fabian Thylmann's Reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>

Feeling the pressure, the original founders decided to cash out. In 2009, they sold Pornhub for $140 million to Fabian Thylmann, a German businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. Thylmann, a programming genius, had a background in the internet traffic statistics and adult entertainment space. At 17, he created a website tracking successful internet companies and noticed the dominance of porn sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. He then built the number one affiliate tracking tool used by these sites, sold that company, and became independently wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

Thylmann proved to be a highly effective operator, doubling the business's profits in three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. He addressed legal vulnerabilities by spending $1 million on content licensing rights to avoid lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. He also attempted to legitimize the company by launching PR campaigns around safe sex and engaging with politicians, and even tried to expand into a broader media empire by acquiring sites like Celebs.com to create a TMZ-like platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. By age 32, with 500 employees, Thylmann was the world's biggest "porn Tycoon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

Under Thylmann, data scientists discovered optimal monetization strategies, finding that a paywall at 2 minutes and 59 seconds into a video was most effective for converting free users to paid subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. However, his reign was also marked by challenges and controversy, such as taking a $362 million loan at a 20% interest rate from 125 secret lenders, some of whom were ex-Morgan Stanley bankers who formed a specific lending firm for this venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. This led to massive interest payments of $60-100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. The CEO's $16 million house was even burned down by arsonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Crusade and Thylmann's Downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>

The "Game of Thrones" continued with activist investor Bill Ackman entering the fray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. Inspired by a *New York Times* article about a teenage girl whose nude photos were leaked onto one of these sites and could not be removed, Ackman embarked on a "crusade to take down Pornhub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Unable to pressure an offshore, privately owned company, Ackman targeted their financial lifeline: payment processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. He directly contacted the CEO of Visa, urging them to cut ties with Pornhub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. Within a day, Visa and MasterCard ceased processing payments for Pornhub, forcing them to implement stricter user verification policies, including requiring licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. Ackman publicly encouraged victims to pursue claims against the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

Fabian Thylmann eventually faced tax fraud or evasion charges in Germany, which forced him into a fire sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. He sold MindGeek (Pornhub's parent company) for $77 million, a significant drop from the $140 million he paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. For context, this was the same price that [[the_growth_and_strategy_behind_morning_brew | Morning Brew]] sold for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. At the time of sale, Pornhub was the sixth most trafficked website in the U.S., with two billion visits per month and an average visit duration of 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.

## What Happened Next? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>

### The Original Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>

After selling Pornhub, the original founders, including Usam Yousef and Stefan Manos, deliberately removed any mention of their past association with the adult entertainment industry from their public profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Yousef, seeking a "reset" from the stressful and sketchy nature of their previous venture, dedicated a year to reading 150 books on investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

He emerged a Warren Buffett disciple and founded Valsoft, a "Berkshire Hathaway for internet companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. Valsoft specializes in buying profitable, cash-flowing internet software companies, inspired by the model of Constellation Software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. Starting in 2016, Yousef identified an opaque and inefficient market for private software companies, particularly those with revenues of $5-10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. Valsoft started by acquiring one company in 2016 (software for small hotels), then three in 2017, and now buys 20-25 companies annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>. Examples of their acquisitions include Nitar (cloud-based car rental software) and Malpractice (chiropractor software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

Valsoft is now a billion-dollar company with over $100 million in EBITDA annually, $500 million in revenue, and 20-30% net profit margins, planning to go public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.

### The Latest Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>

Initially, it was reported that MindGeek was acquired by its own executives for $77 million, but it was later revealed that an Austrian businessman named Bernd Bergmair was the true principal owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>. Bergmair, who had a background in finance at Goldman Sachs and had previously bought and sold RedTube to MindGeek, was leveraging his ownership to extract profits through internal debt payments and by shifting revenue among shell companies, making MindGeek's reported financials show almost no profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.

However, Bergmair also faced challenges, including a divorce where his wife demanded he cut ties with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. This eventually led to another change of hands. Pornhub is now owned by a private equity group named Ethical Capital Partners, a firm reportedly formed solely to acquire this asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>.

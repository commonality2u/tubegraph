The "Big Box Strategy" in e-commerce involves taking highly desirable products that are typically sold at a high price point and creating a more affordable version specifically for big-box retailers like Walmart, Costco, and Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This approach aims to capture a broader market by offering a similar product at a lower cost, often with slightly reduced quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Advantages of the Big Box Strategy
Big box retailers like Costco and Walmart are known for driving "insane volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A company successfully securing a deal with such a retailer could be "more successful than 99% of [[ecommerce_business_ideas | e-commerce stores]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The strategy suggests focusing on creating a single product specifically for these channels as a complete business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Challenges of Partnering with Big Box Retailers
While volume is high, retailers like Costco are known for cutting "pretty ruthless deals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Losing a Costco deal or facing an unfulfilled purchase order can be financially devastating for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Examples of the Big Box Strategy in Practice

### Echelon Fitness
Echelon Fitness is cited as a prime example of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Echelon created fitness equipment that closely resembled Peloton's offerings but was significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. At CES, Echelon's booth was initially mistaken for Peloton's due to its similar appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Echelon's product line includes:
*   A fitness mirror (similar to Mirror) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   A smart rower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   A Peloton-like bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
*   A smart treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

Echelon is on track to do $200 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> and has secured partnerships with celebrities like Pitbull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. They also sell their products in Walmart, Costco, and Target, targeting a customer base that Peloton and Lululemon (Mirror's parent company) explicitly avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Kevin Hart's VitaHustle
Kevin Hart launched VitaHustle, a product sold at Walmart at a lower price point, which is essentially a version of Athletic Greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Athletic Greens costs around $80 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, while VitaHustle offers a similar concept with Kevin Hart's endorsement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This venture is projected to earn Kevin Hart $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Costco's Own Brands
Costco frequently carries what are described as "American knockoffs" of popular American products in its electronics section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Examples include:
*   A "nine sleep" mattress, similar to Eight Sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. A $280 Costco mattress is highly praised by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Blenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Fitness trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

## Unexploited Opportunities in Big Box Retail

### Oura Ring Alternative
An opportunity exists to create a more affordable alternative to the Oura Ring for Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The Oura Ring, a device that tracks sleep and other metrics, has sold billions of dollars worth but is priced high (around $500-$700) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Currently, there is no direct replacement for it available at Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

This specific example illustrates the broader [[niche_markets_in_ecommerce | niche market]] opportunity to identify high-end, desirable products not yet present in big-box stores and introduce a "down market" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

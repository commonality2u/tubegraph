Ishan, a young investor who began as an intern for the podcast "My First Million," shares his journey into the world of cryptocurrency, including significant wins and losses, and offers key insights into his [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Early Forays and Market Volatility

Ishan's journey into cryptocurrency trading began during his time working on the podcast, where he was exposed to various business experiments, including e-commerce ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### The Bitcoin Flash Crash Experience
During a work call, Ishan reacted instantly to a significant drop in Bitcoin's price from $60,000 to $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. He seized the opportunity to invest his available funds, around a couple of thousand dollars, by going 20x or 25x leverage long on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Risk-Taking in Volatile Markets
> This involved significant risk, as leverage trading meant a small price drop could lead to liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The exchange froze during his transaction, causing panic, but when it unfroze, he found himself up $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This quick action yielded more money than six months of other business experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

The key takeaway from this experience is that significant financial gains can sometimes be made in "very few moments" that require immediate, decisive action, rather than consistent day-trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. It reflects the idea that "luck favors the prepared mind," where one recognizes an opportunity when others might be paralyzed by fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## High-Conviction [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | Investment strategies]]

Ishan's [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment approach]] leans towards high-conviction bets, focusing on opportunities where traditional valuation methods are difficult to apply, attracting "degenerate" investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### Animoca Brands: From Delisting to Millions
Ishan initially invested a few thousand dollars in Animoca Brands, an Australian-listed company that pivoted from robotics to blockchain gaming and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Despite the stock performing well initially, it was delisted from the Australian stock exchange due to its involvement with crypto, leading Ishan to believe he had lost his entire $25,000 investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

> [!INFO] Doubling Down on Conviction
> Instead of giving up, Ishan doubled down, learning about secondary markets and researching Animoca's long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. He understood the value of in-game items becoming tradable assets through his experience with Minecraft servers as a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. He sourced shares from disgruntled top shareholders at an 80-90% discount, investing a total of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

Ishan viewed this as a long-term play, expecting returns after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. However, within three months, Animoca raised funds at a $1 billion valuation from a $30-40 million valuation when he bought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. He rode the NFT market craze, with his holdings peaking at over $10 million, as Animoca's valuation rose to $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. Despite being offered $2 million, he chose not to sell, believing in the company's long-term potential to become a multi-hundred-billion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Afterpay Investment
Ishan also had success with Afterpay, an Australian "buy now, pay later" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. He gained an edge by following the movements of a co-founder who was near Square offices in San Francisco, predicting a potential acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Square eventually acquired Afterpay for $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

## Building a Crypto Casino: Shuffle

Leveraging his experience and network, Ishan joined a team to build Shuffle, a crypto casino and a competitor to the successful "Stake" platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

### Market Opportunity and Risk
Ishan noted the immense profitability of companies like Stake, which generated billions in revenue and hundreds of millions in profit within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. The crypto casino model mirrors that of exchanges (like FTX), profiting from transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Regulatory Landscape
> The primary risk in this business is regulatory, as crypto casinos often operate under specific licenses from jurisdictions like Curacao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Unlike most startups that face product-market fit or technical risk, crypto casinos primarily navigate regulatory challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. Ishan's team built their platform in a modular way to adapt to potential changes in licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

### Traction and Strategy
Shuffle, launched in February, is projected to do half a billion in volume this month, generating a few million in monthly revenue and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. The business model is designed to "strip out the cash flow" rather than aiming for an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

Customer acquisition is challenging due to restrictions on traditional advertising platforms like Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

> [!INFO] High-Value Customer Acquisition
> *   **Targeting High-Value Players**: Instead of chasing thousands of small depositors, Shuffle focuses on "high rollers" who place large bets and are less demanding on customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
> *   **Geographic Focus**: Specific markets like Japan have proven to yield valuable, respectful customers who bet big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
> *   **Affiliate and Influencer Marketing**: Mimicking Stake's strategy, Shuffle leverages affiliates and influencers who live-stream their gameplay. This method provides product education and real-time engagement, leading to higher conversion rates compared to static advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. Influencers with deeply engaged, smaller audiences (e.g., active Discord communities) are more valuable than those with large, passive follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

## Lessons on [[Investment Strategies and Experiences | Investment Strategies and Experiences]]

Ishan's journey highlights several key lessons:
*   **Embrace "Degeneracy"**: The term "degenerate" is used playfully to describe a passionate, obsessive drive to master a skill or project, often outside traditional academic or career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Individuals with early obsessions in areas like gaming (e.g., Minecraft, RuneScape) often possess the intensity and focus required for entrepreneurial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **"Lines Not Dots"**: Building trust and securing opportunities, especially in investments, is a cumulative process of many small interactions rather than a single "pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **Localization is Crucial**: When expanding into new markets, understanding local nuances, culture, and even specific phrases is vital. AI translation alone may not capture the correct tone, as learned when automated translations in Japanese led to unintentional disrespect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.
*   **Intensity as a Strategy**: Successful individuals often demonstrate an unwavering focus and intensity, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional timelines (e.g., scheduling multiple meetings in a single day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>.

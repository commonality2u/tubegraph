Connor and Brianna, a husband-and-wife duo, have achieved significant success in the music industry by leveraging [[creative_process_and_collaboration_in_content_creation | collaborative content creation]] and [[social_media_growth_strategies | viral marketing]] strategies, particularly on platforms like TikTok and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. Their approach prioritizes entertainment and storytelling to engage audiences, leading to millions of streams and a rapidly growing independent music business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

## Core Strategy: Skits and Hooks

Brianna emphasizes that the goal of their videos is to avoid making it seem like they are directly "selling" a song, especially on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Instead, they focus on providing entertainment first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Their primary method for this is through short, engaging skits that precede the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

Connor, who has been acting since age six, seamlessly integrates his acting background by playing multiple characters within these skits, such as the rapper, the producer, and the "nerdy brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This creates a sense of curiosity and keeps viewers engaged before the song begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. The rapid pacing of their videos ensures a new element or "hook" appears every few seconds to maintain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The process often involves thinking about the content first, then creating music around a "contentable moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. An example given is the "carrot flute" video, where a unique instrument became the central visual element of the skit, leading to people associating Connor with the "carrot flute guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## The "Spin the Globe" Series: A Case Study in Viral Collaboration

A pivotal moment in their virality was the creation of the "Spin the Globe" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The concept involves Connor spinning a globe, landing his finger on a country, and then finding an artist from that country to [[creative_process_and_collaboration_in_content_creation | collaborate]] on a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

The first video in this series featured an artist from Zambia named Killa, who had fewer than 1,000 monthly listeners at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This video garnered 72 million views on TikTok and another 72 million on YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The "hook" of the spinning globe and the mystery of where it would land immediately captured viewer interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. The series allowed them to tell a [[storytelling_and_its_role_in_content_creation | story]] around the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

This series significantly impacted their growth, taking them from under a thousand dollars in monthly revenue to a six-figure month within three months due to the delay in accounting for streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The follow-up episode, "Spinning," became their top song with over 100 million streams on Spotify in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Platform Strategy and Monetization

Connor and Brianna strategically utilize different platforms for different purposes:
*   **TikTok** is primarily used for reaching new listeners through viral, hook-driven content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. TikTok itself does not pay for views, so the goal is to convert viewers into music streamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. However, TikTok's removal of the pinned comment feature and its algorithm's tendency to hide mentions of external links make direct conversion challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **YouTube Shorts** has been highly effective for subscriber growth, with Connor gaining 800,000 subscribers in one month by repurposing popular TikToks without watermarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. YouTube is considered more creator-friendly and allows pinned comments with streaming links, making it easier to convert views to streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. YouTube also pays well through AdSense compared to other social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Long-form YouTube videos** are used more for nurturing existing listeners rather than solely acquiring new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

Their revenue streams, which are all maintained independently, include:
1.  **Streaming royalties:** Averaging 60 million streams per month on Spotify, with a general rate of around $4,000 USD per million streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. They emphasize that owning their masters (songs) allows them to keep a significantly higher percentage of revenue compared to artists signed to labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
2.  **YouTube AdSense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Brand deals:** Negotiating high six-figure deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Syncs:** Licensing songs for commercials, TV, and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
5.  **Publishing royalties:** From songwriting and performance rights when songs are played on radio or covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
6.  **Merchandise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
7.  **Live shows/Festivals:** While touring can be costly and break even at their current stage, festivals offer guaranteed payment for shorter performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. They prioritize live shows for fan connection rather than immediate profit, often doing free meet-and-greets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Family and Team Collaboration

The entire business operates as a family endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Brianna handles most of the marketing strategy, including scripting videos and managing brand deals, with the help of a brand agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Connor films and edits the videos, often late at night to maximize efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Brianna's sister, brother-in-law (Christian, who mixes, masters, and produces much of the music, including the carrot flute beat), and little brother all contribute, having quit their previous jobs to work full-time for the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

This close-knit collaboration allows for rapid production and creative control. Brianna, previously a social media assistant and creative director at pet company Alpha Paw for entrepreneur Ramon, leveraged her experience in creating viral ads for their music business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Her homeschooling experience as a child fostered a creative need and an early interest in starting businesses and documenting things through film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Future Aspirations and Industry Impact

Connor and Brianna have set an ambitious goal of potentially selling their music catalog for $500 million in three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Their strategy is to continuously invest in new music, viewing each song as a piece of "real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

They aspire to expand their content into larger productions:
*   **"The Studio" Series:** A dream is to create a show similar to *The Office* but set in a music studio, extending their current skit characters and potentially featuring guest actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **"Spin the Globe" on Netflix:** They envision a 45-minute episode format where Connor actually travels to the chosen country to meet the artist, explore their culture, and document the local music scene, bringing awareness to global music experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

They are "independent by choice," choosing not to sign with major labels despite offers, to maintain control over their creative process and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. They aim to inspire other artists by demonstrating that success is possible independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

Connor and Brianna also identify [[opportunities in content creator partnerships | adjacent opportunities]] in the content creation space. One example is collaborating with Kevin, who runs an Instagram account called Icon Brick creating Lego animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. They see the potential for him to leverage his platform to release his own music while also creating content for labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

They are aware of the challenge of attaching the artist to the viral sound, ensuring that while short clips might go viral, audiences connect the sound back to Connor as the artist for long-term [[building_an_audience_and_content_creation | audience building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

Inspired by content creators like [[mrbeasts_approach_to_viral_content_creation | MrBeast]], they focus on continuous audience growth and see themselves creating a new lane for music promotion, blending fast-paced, hooky content with traditional music release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Connor also offers all his music as DMCA safe and copyright-free for other streamers and video creators, viewing the long-term value of creators using his music as more beneficial than small monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

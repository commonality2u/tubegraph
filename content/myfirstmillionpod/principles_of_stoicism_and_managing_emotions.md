Scott Galloway frequently discusses the importance of [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | emotional management]] and [[core_principles_for_achieving_financial_success | stoicism]] in achieving not only financial success but also mental well-being. He emphasizes that focusing on what one can control, rather than external factors or others' perceptions, is key to navigating life's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The Core of Stoicism
Galloway, inspired by Ryan Holiday, distills [[core_principles_for_achieving_financial_success | stoicism]] into a fundamental principle: life is not about what happens to you, as you cannot control that, but rather how you respond to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is to focus on controllable aspects, particularly one's own emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A powerful analogy cited is from *Brokeback Mountain*: "If you can't fix it, you got to stand it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## External Affirmation and Social Media
Galloway admits to being "addicted to strangers' affirmation," calling it "pathetic" at his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He views external affirmation as a form of addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He highlights that people are not thinking about your wealth, failures, or successes as much as you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The key is to be comfortable with oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

He personally stopped using Twitter for nine months, finding it "one of the most accretive things" to his mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He noted that many of his "bummed out" weekends started on Twitter, leading him to question why he was on a platform that regularly upset him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He warns about the addictive nature of social media, particularly for teenagers, who can be drawn down rabbit holes of extreme content related to dieting or even suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. His household rule is that children are not allowed to be alone in their rooms with phones, due to the rapid and ugly nature of algorithm-driven content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Humility and Forgiveness
Galloway advises humility during wins, acknowledging that much success is not due to personal fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Conversely, he advocates for self-forgiveness during failures, as many setbacks are also beyond personal control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He struggles with anger, often directing it at himself, making it hard to move past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Regrets and Personal Growth
Research on people near death indicates their biggest regrets are:
*   Not staying in better touch with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Not living the life they truly wanted, rather than one dictated by society or parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Being too hard on themselves and not allowing themselves to be happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

He urges listeners to "stop beating yourself up" and "squeeze as much juice out of this lemon as conceivable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This includes being open to happiness and sadness, recognizing that sometimes being "down" is more about brain chemistry than legitimate reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Moving Past Setbacks
Galloway emphasizes the need to put a "statute of limitations" on negative events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. For example, after a parent's death, one should still be sad but able to function within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For business failures or emotional traumas, there should be a timeline after which one must seek help if unable to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Time moves quickly, and skills and confidence can atrophy if one gets stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

He believes the key to success, as stated by Churchill, is "the ability to move through failure without losing your sense of enthusiasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. He highlights that he has often been able to "mourn and move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Personal Relationships and Boundaries
Galloway notes the importance of distinguishing between being a friend and being a manager or parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. He applies this to his professional life, where he might join team outings but leaves early to allow younger colleagues to socialize without feeling judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Similarly, as a father, he realized he's not his children's friend, but their dad, and their interests may not align with his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Overall Philosophy
Ultimately, Galloway encourages embracing life fully. He emphasizes enjoying relationships and experiences, even seemingly trivial ones, because "everything everywhere ends" and time goes "so goddamn fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. His personal excitement now comes from spending time with his healthy children and partner, and having a "really nice life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. He finds beauty in the concept that "grief is love's receipts," meaning that loss is a testament to having had something wonderful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

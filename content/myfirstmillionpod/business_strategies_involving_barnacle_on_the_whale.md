The "Barnacle on the Whale" is a business strategy focused on attaching oneself to a larger, growing entity to gain [[Marketing and sales strategies for new businesses | free marketing]] and sales, thereby significantly reducing customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This approach can lead to highly profitable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

## Core Concept
The strategy involves identifying a large, established platform or "whale" that attracts a lot of traffic or has a large user base, and then creating a product or service that can be offered within or alongside that platform. By doing so, the "barnacle" business benefits from the whale's marketing efforts and brand recognition, eliminating the need for significant independent marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Origin and Example: Shopify Themes
Andrew Wilkinson, founder of Tiny, stumbled upon this strategy about 12 years ago at a conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. He met Harley and Toby from Shopify, which at the time was a small, bootstrapped startup with about 15 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

Shopify proposed that Wilkinson's design agency create themes for their marketplace. This was not client work, meaning they wouldn't be paid upfront. Instead, they would list the themes in Shopify's marketplace, and users would pay between $49 to $250 for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

Wilkinson started earning $5,000 to $10,000 per month from these theme sales without having to promote them or think about marketing or SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Shopify drove all the traffic to their marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

As Shopify grew and invested hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing, Wilkinson's theme business (later spun out as Pixel Union) received free marketing, leading to significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. Initially, by owning more and more "squares" in the theme marketplace, there was a 50% chance that a chosen theme was one of theirs, indicating early market saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

This business, started with an initial investment of about $20,000, eventually went public at a $260 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. Wilkinson initially sold the business for approximately $7 million due to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. After realizing its competitive advantages, he later bought it back for $25 million and subsequently took it public after additional M&A and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. This demonstrates how a small initial investment, leveraging a larger platform, can lead to substantial [[Wealth building and management strategies | wealth building]] and business growth.

## Identifying Opportunities
This strategy is highly effective because marketing often accounts for 15% to 30% of most business costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. By eliminating or drastically reducing this expense, a business can achieve profit margins of 45%, 50%, or even 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

Another example of this is a fitness influencer who sells supplements, energy drinks, and hair loss shampoo. Their content provides free marketing for their products, making their e-commerce business highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

When looking for "whale" opportunities, it's advised to seek out:
*   **Unsaturated ecosystems:** Current Shopify is considered saturated, making it harder to replicate the early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **New or growing software ecosystems:** Examples include Discord or other emerging app stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

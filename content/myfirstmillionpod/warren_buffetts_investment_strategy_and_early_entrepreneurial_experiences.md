Warren Buffett, often referred to as the Indian [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] by some, is a billionaire investor known for his unique approach to business and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His methods and principles, deeply influenced by his early experiences and associations, have shaped a highly successful [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | investment philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Early Entrepreneurial Ventures

Buffett's journey began with various [[early_entrepreneurship_and_diverse_business_ventures | diverse business ventures]] from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. He started specializing in business between the ages of 11 and 20, a crucial window for brain development and specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

*   **First Business** His very first business, around five or six years old, involved buying Cokes from his grandfather's store for a nickel and selling them for a dime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This taught him the concept of buying wholesale and selling retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Racing Tips** Around 10 or 11, Buffett ran interesting businesses, including publishing racing tips called "Stable Boy Selections" at an Omaha racetrack, advising on which horses to bet on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Discarded Tickets** He would also collect discarded tickets at the racetrack and go through them carefully to find winning tickets that drunk individuals might have thrown out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:02]</a>. Being too young to collect winnings himself, he would give them to his Aunt Alice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Pinball Machines** At 14 or 15, with his mechanically inclined friend Don Danley, Buffett formed the "Wilson Coin Operated Amusement Company" (a fictitious entity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. They would buy broken pinball machines for about $15, repair them for $3 in parts, and place them in barber shops, splitting the earnings 50/50 with the barbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This venture eventually expanded to about 40 barber shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Buffett considered the first week's take of $6 from a barber shop as "dying and going to heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Rolls-Royce Rental** Another venture with Danley involved buying a non-running Rolls-Royce for $300, fixing it for $50 in parts, and renting it out for $100 on weekends for weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. During weekdays, they would drive the Rolls-Royce to high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

These [[early_entrepreneurship_and_diverse_business_ventures | early entrepreneurial experiences]] allowed Buffett to specialize in and understand business models in his formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. By age 17, when he went to college, he had amassed $155,000 (equivalent to about $150,000 today), which he used to pay for his own college and told his father he didn't need an inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Evolution

Buffett's interest in [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investing]] began when he was 11, buying his first stock after visiting his stockbroker father's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. However, his [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | investment philosophy]] truly formed at 19 after reading *The Intelligent Investor* by Ben Graham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. He later applied to Columbia Business School to learn directly from Graham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

### Business Acumen in Investing

Buffett famously stated, "I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Both business and [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | investing]] utilize the same brain regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Successful entrepreneurs are naturally inclined to be great investors with a few tweaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. This stems from the shared trait of minimizing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

> "Entrepreneurs do not take risk. They do everything in their power to minimize risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>

### The Impact of See's Candy

The acquisition of See's Candy by Berkshire Hathaway in 1972 for $25 million was a pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Initially, Buffett and [[the_influence_of_char_munger_and_warren_buffett | Charlie Munger]] found it hard to justify paying three times book value for a "stupid candy business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. However, See's taught them invaluable lessons about brands and consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

*   **Pricing Power**: Buffett would personally set See's prices each year, consistently raising them by 10-15% while inflation was around 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Despite these significant increases, unit volumes continued to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This demonstrated the power of a strong brand and customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Efficiency**: See's was a "free cash flow" business, requiring no additional capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. It has since sent billions in dividends to Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve**: While See's was a slow grower (unit volume up 2% annually over 50 years) and difficult to expand beyond California, the lessons learned about branding paved the way for larger, more impactful investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### The Coca-Cola Investment

The understanding gained from See's was directly applied to the investment in Coca-Cola in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway put a quarter of its entire book value into Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

*   **Global Brand Power**: Unlike See's, Coke has a 100-year history of traveling well globally, being ubiquitous in nearly every country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Behavior**: Buffett understood that while there's a limit to candy consumption, Coke has no "taste memory" or aftertaste, allowing for greater consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Shift in Strategy**: These experiences transitioned Buffett and [[the_influence_of_char_munger_and_warren_buffett | Munger]] from "hardcore quantitative deep value guys" to understanding the nuances of brands and consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Key Investment Principles

*   **Inactivity**: The key to moving the needle in investing is inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Buffett's famous "paint drying" decision emphasizes that once you have a small ownership in a great business, the best course of action is often to do nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Asymmetric Bets**: The philosophy of "Heads I win, Tails I don't lose much" means seeking out opportunities where the odds are heavily in your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Patience**: This is considered the number one trait for a great investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. An investor needs to be able to "watch paint dry" or "watch the back of an airplane seat for a few hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **Low Risk, High Return**: Great entrepreneurs and value investors both aim for low-risk, high-return scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **"Called Strikes"**: Buffett uses a baseball analogy, stating that in [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | investing]], there are no called strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. One can let a thousand opportunities pass by and only swing when "eight moons line up" for a "fat pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fearful When Others Are Greedy**: When the world is running away from something hated and unloved, that's where opportunities for mispricing arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Influence of Charlie Munger

Buffett's relationship with [[the_influence_of_char_munger_and_warren_buffett | Charlie Munger]] was deeply influential. Buffett even arranged a meeting for Monish Pabrai with Munger, joking that he wanted to prove Munger was "useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Munger's directness and selflessness were highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Munger's philosophy on people: Be a harsh grader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. If you hang out with people better than you, you get better; if worse, you get worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. He advises against letting loyalties get in the way of cutting ties with those who have ethical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

> "I tried to be useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
> — Charlie Munger's desired epitaph.

Munger selflessly helped Buffett and others, always giving "the better deal" in business partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. He transformed institutions he touched, like the Harvard-Westlake School and Good Samaritan Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Munger was stoic in the face of adversity, never complaining, and focused on helping the world and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

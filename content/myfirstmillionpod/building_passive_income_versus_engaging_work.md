The traditional pursuit of "passive income" and "freedom" is often misunderstood, according to entrepreneur Alex. He suggests that while many seek liberation from work, the true underlying desire is for "options for engaging activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## The Realization: Beyond Passive Income

After selling three of his majority-owned companies—Alan, Prestige Labs, and Gym Launch—in 2021, Alex found himself experiencing a period of intense boredom, which he describes as an "existential crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. He had optimized his life to outsource activities and "buy back" his time, achieving what he believed was freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. However, he realized that having "all your time back and you have nothing to do" was unsatisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

Looking back, he felt nostalgia for the periods when he was actively building these companies, considering them "some of the happiest times of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This experience led him to conclude that [[passive_income_strategies | passive income]] itself is "overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## The Shift to Optionality

This revelation prompted a significant shift in his perspective: from desiring "freedom" to prioritizing "optionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. He is now back in the business "game" with [[building_and_automating_online_businesses | Acquisition.com]], where he genuinely enjoys the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. The key difference this time is that he has the *option* to engage in work that he loves, rather than feeling compelled to do so out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

He outlines a progression for [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | building wealth and managing it]]:
1.  **Do what is necessary** to cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
2.  **Use accumulated money** to buy back time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
3.  **Intentionally spend time** on activities that are desired and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

Alex emphasizes his love for business, stating, "i love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. He works extensively, often from 5 AM to 4 PM, integrating gym time during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. This dedication reflects his acceptance that he loves working, free from external judgment on how much he "should do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. He believes that others' arbitrary ideals of "balance" are irrelevant to him, as his current engagement is what he enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

This perspective highlights the importance of finding work that provides intrinsic satisfaction, rather than solely focusing on the absence of work as the ultimate goal. For Alex, true freedom lies in the ability to choose engaging activities, even if they involve significant effort and time.

The concept of "Sarah's List" highlights an often-underrated path to wealth creation: working for successful tech companies and benefiting from their [[exponential_growth_in_tech_companies | exponential growth]] through stock grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. This strategy suggests that one doesn't need to be a founder or a top executive to become a millionaire in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>.

## The Origin of "Sarah's List"

The inspiration for "Sarah's List" came from an individual named Sarah, who became a self-made millionaire not by inventing the next big thing or making a crazy investment, but by working at good tech companies in a normal job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>. She was a non-technical person, not an engineer, demonstrating that this path is accessible beyond coding roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

The mechanism is simple: a job offer might include, for example, $50,000 per year in stock compensation. Over four years, this amounts to $200,000 in stock. If the company's value grows 5x during those four years, that stock package could turn into $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Sarah successfully applied this strategy at companies like Facebook and Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, joining when Airbnb already had hundreds, if not thousands, of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. When she joined, Airbnb was valued at approximately $18 billion, and at its peak IPO, it was worth $110 billion, representing about a 5x growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## "Sarah's List" Companies: A One-Year Check-in

A previous discussion identified 12 companies as potential "bets" for employees to gain significant wealth through stock grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These predictions were made around September 17, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, at the beginning of a strong tech bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

As of September 2022, nearly all but two of the companies on "Sarah's List" had seen an increase in valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The two exceptions, Zapier and Uniswap, haven't raised new rounds, so their updated valuations are unknown, though Uniswap's value might be down due to the overall crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Zapier intentionally avoids frequent fundraising, opting to bootstrap until a potential public offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Here's a breakdown of the companies and their valuation changes:

*   **Figma:** Acquired for $20 billion, up from $2 billion when on the list, a 10x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Figma's revenue grew from $0 in 2017 to an projected $450 million in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Flexport:** Valued at $8 billion, up from $3 billion, nearly a 3x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Anduril:** Valued at $6.6 billion, up from $4.6 billion, approximately a 50% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Replit:** Last known valuation was $800 million, up from $200 million, at least a 4x increase, potentially more like 8x based on secondary market interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Airtable:** Valued at $11 billion, up from $2.3 billion, a 5x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Rippling:** Valued at $11 billion, up from $6 billion, nearly a 2x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **OpenStore:** Valued at $750 million, up from $250 million, a 3x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Faire:** Valued at $12.5 billion, up from $7 billion, almost a 2x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Next Health:** Valued at $1 billion, up from $400 million, a 2.5x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **OneTrust:** Valued at $5.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion, nearly a 2x increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

This demonstrates that the list had a strong performance, with 10 out of 12 companies showing positive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | Investing in Tech Startups]]

1.  **[[exponential_growth_in_tech_companies | Exponential Growth]] is Hard to Fathom:** It's challenging for most people to truly comprehend how much a company's value can grow. Thinking in terms of 2x, 3x, or 4x is difficult, let alone imagining companies reaching tens or hundreds of billions, or even trillion-dollar valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. For example, Facebook's initial $15 billion valuation with minimal revenue seemed high, but it eventually became a trillion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Similarly, Tesla, valued at $2 billion at one point, later reached a trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

2.  **It Always Seems Too Late:** A common reaction to these opportunities is that the company is already "overvalued" or "too big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. However, the nature of [[exponential_growth_in_tech_companies | exponential growth]] means that what appears to be "late" is often just the beginning of a significant upward trend. Even investing in Tesla at $2 billion felt "late" because it was already a known, successful company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

3.  **Successful Startups are Often "Obvious":** Many of the companies that achieved significant growth on "Sarah's List" were not unknown or obscure. They were often already recognized as promising, appearing on lists of "best startups to work at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The success wasn't due to special insider knowledge but rather identifying companies with strong fundamentals, great products, and real growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

4.  **Embrace Risk and a Childlike Approach:** The biggest risk for most people is not playing life too risky, but playing it too safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The advice for many should be to have more fun, live more childlike, and take more risks, rather than being overly serious and practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Childlike traits like curiosity, a desire for fun, and a focus on play over just work are often found in the happiest people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This philosophy can extend to [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | investment strategies and venture creation]] as well, encouraging a more adventurous mindset.

## The Future of "Sarah's List"

Given the success of the initial list, there's a suggestion to create an updated "Sarah's List 2.0" to identify new opportunities, especially during periods when valuations might be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The idea is to continue highlighting companies where an employee could potentially turn a stock package into significant wealth over a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

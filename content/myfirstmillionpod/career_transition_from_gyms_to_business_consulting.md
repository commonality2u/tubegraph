The speaker's career trajectory began in fitness and evolved significantly into business consulting and acquisitions, marked by strategic pivots and a deep understanding of market dynamics.

## Early Beginnings in the Fitness Industry

At 26 years old, the speaker owned and operated six successful gym locations, which were profitable and self-funded through cash flow. He even slept on the gym floor for nine months to manage the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This initial venture was largely built on his ability to attract customers effectively, achieving a 30:1 customer lifetime value (LTV) to customer acquisition cost (CAC) ratio on the front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Leads could cost as little as 25 cents in some markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

A key component of this success was an irresistible offer: a free six-week challenge where participants received their money back if they lost 20 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This approach led to high success rates (70-80%) in weight loss programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The business model also leveraged upsells, such as selling supplements immediately after initial sign-up and transitioning clients from the six-week challenge into longer-term, discounted memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:36]</a>.

Prior to this, the speaker was a [[consulting_for_private_equity_businesses | management consultant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

## Transition to Business-to-Business (B2B) Consulting

A mentor advised the speaker to stop owning all the gyms and instead license the successful model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This marked a shift from a B2C (business-to-consumer) model to a B2B (business-to-business) approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Gym Turnarounds and the "Gym Rescue" Concept

Initially, the speaker and his wife spent two years performing 32 gym turnarounds, flying out to locations to fix pricing, change layouts, and improve sales processes, essentially acting as management consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. They would charge 100% of the upfront cash collected during a 21-day launch period, averaging $100,000 per gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

The original concept was "Gym Rescue," similar to "Bar Rescue," but the business model had a critical flaw: the speaker didn't control fulfillment. Gyms receiving the launch services were often struggling, leading to poor customer fulfillment and subsequent refunds. This resulted in significant losses, with one instance seeing $150,000 in refunds from just three facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### The Genesis of "Gym Launch"

Facing mounting refunds, the speaker considered pivoting to a direct-to-consumer weight loss program using his wife as the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, a desperate gym owner, whose launch was cancelled, pleaded for help, having refinanced his house and maxed out credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The speaker, reluctantly, offered to show him what to do for an arbitrary price of $6,000, which was immediately accepted. A subsequent call led to an $8,000 sale for the same service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. This led to the creation of "Gym Launch," a rebranding from "Gym Rescue" to focus on launching rather than rescuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

The "Gym Launch" product was a comprehensive marketing and sales system, acting as a "marketing machine" rather than a traditional course or back-end operations system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. It provided:
*   Pre-built ads and landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>
*   Targeting and follow-up sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>
*   Lobby setup and sales presentation scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>
*   Internal sales training designed to quickly onboard new salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>

This system enabled gyms to collect an average of $30,000 in additional cash in the first 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. The initial price was $16,000 for the launch program, followed by three-year licensing agreements for $42,000 a year ($800/week) for ongoing continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. As gyms scaled, they needed help with hiring trainers and sales teams, and the speaker provided these solutions based on his own gym experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### Financial Success of Gym Launch

The growth of Gym Launch was rapid:
*   **Year 1:** $6.8 million in top-line revenue, $3 million in EBITDA (hybrid model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Year 2:** $25.9 million in top-line revenue, $17 million in EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Year 3:** $37 million in top-line revenue, but EBITDA dropped to $13.4 million due to starting a second active company and a 25% price cut that didn't reduce churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Insights on Business Models and Growth

The speaker realized the power of a "build once, sell twice" model, where services are packaged into scalable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. The key was zero incremental cost for selling the intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

He highlights the benefit of charging a high upfront commitment, as people are most excited to buy at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. Over time, as information's perceived value decreases, the continuity price can be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>. This contrasts with common SaaS models that aim for low friction and free trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>.

## Evolution to Acquisition.com

A pivotal moment occurred at a Russell Brunson mastermind event, where the speaker, then 26 or 27, was still focused on expanding his gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. After presenting his gym's successful acquisition process, Russell Brunson told him, "Alex, you shouldn't be running gyms, you should be showing gym owners exactly what you showed me. Right now you're in a level two opportunity with a level 10 skill set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This was a "ton of bricks" moment that shattered his original vision of "United Fitness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

He defines an "opportunity vehicle" by three factors: potential units sold, gross margin per unit, and supply/demand dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. The insight was that while his gyms had a good model, the *potential* and *margin* in licensing his expertise were far greater.

In 2021, the speaker sold three companies: Gym Launch, Prestige Labs (a supplement company launched in 2018 that used a drop-shipping model through gyms, generating $1.7M in its first month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>, and Vallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

This led to the creation of [[consulting_for_private_equity_businesses | Acquisition.com]], where he now buys majority interests (20-33%) in niche service businesses and deploys his proven models to help them scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. He particularly likes high cash flow service businesses because they are "super malleable" and allow for easy changes to price points, products, and client experience without extensive development work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

Current targets for Acquisition.com include:
*   Niche [[Fitness Business Models | e-learning businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>
*   Brick-and-mortar chains with multiple successful locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>
*   Tech-enabled services with potential for software components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>

An example of their current ventures is a children's photography business, "Magic Chain of Fairies," which they now own all 13 locations of. This business is mission-driven and projected to be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

[[investment_journey_and_insights_of_kevin_rose | Kevin Rose]], a prominent internet entrepreneur, became CEO of Hodinkee, a luxury watch blog, after merging his watch aggregation app, Watchville, with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34"></a>. Initially, Hodinkee had annual revenues of around $1.5 to $2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31"></a>. Following the merger and expansion into e-commerce, its annual revenue has grown to over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11"></a>.

## Origin of Hodinkee & Watchville

Hodinkee started as a blog created by Ben Clymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10"></a>. [[investment_journey_and_insights_of_kevin_rose | Kevin Rose]] developed Watchville, an aggregator app for watch content, out of a personal interest in watches that stemmed from inheriting a Rolex from his late father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27"></a>. He observed that most existing watch sites at the time lacked mobile-friendly versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24"></a>. Watchville provided a mobile-optimized platform with features like push notifications for content from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43"></a>.

## Merger and Growth
Recognizing Hodinkee as the leading source of serious watch content, [[investment_journey_and_insights_of_kevin_rose | Kevin Rose]] approached Ben Clymer to merge Watchville's technology with Hodinkee's editorial strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12"></a>. Both companies had small teams of three to four people at the time of the merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21"></a>. Post-merger, [[investment_journey_and_insighs_of_kevin_rose | Kevin Rose]] relocated to New York to become CEO and expanded the business into e-commerce, forming partnerships with major watch brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39"></a>. Hodinkee now operates as an authorized dealer for several dozen prominent watch brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45"></a>.

## Business Model: Content & Commerce
Hodinkee's success is a prime example of a content-to-commerce model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19"></a>. The strategy involved:
*   **Strong Editorial Team** Hiring writers with a deep, "geeky" understanding of horology, including the mechanics, movements, and technical complications of watches, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49"></a>. This expertise built trust with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55"></a>.
*   **Trust as a Foundation** By seriously covering watch mechanics and industry news rather than focusing on quick flips, Hodinkee established itself as a trusted source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51"></a>. This trust enabled them to sell high-value items, such as watches, to their readership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57"></a>.
*   **E-commerce Integration** The content created a highly engaged and knowledgeable audience, which then translated into successful sales of luxury watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03"></a>. An example of this success is a $250,000 transaction for a vintage Rolex that occurred via Apple Pay on their site, which was reportedly the largest known Apple Pay transaction at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03"></a>.

The luxury watch market is a "double-digit billions of dollars a year" industry, though it is often more apparent overseas, especially in Europe, than in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46"></a>. This model is akin to "Bring a Trailer" for cars, where specialized content drives high-value commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:43"></a>.

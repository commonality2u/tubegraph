[[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Michael "Harry O" Harris]] was arrested and sent to prison, causing his life to "crash down" just as his Broadway play, *Checkmate*, was set to fully launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>.

## Arrest and Charges
[[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Harris]] was arrested for attempted murder and drug conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>. The attempted murder charge was later exonerated after 23 years, though at the time, he didn't take it seriously because he knew he was innocent and continued working while out on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:05">[01:58:05]</a>. He was guilty of the drug charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.

He recounts that he had exited the drug business, but previous phone calls pulled him back in, which he calls "Karma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:05">[01:58:05]</a>.

## Drug Business and Its Impact
Reports indicated that at one point, [[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Harris]] was making between $1 million and $2 million a day in cocaine sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. However, he is not proud of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. He realized that while it made him rich, it was making him "poor in spirit and in a culture," as he was helping to destroy his own community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.

Initially, he didn't understand the harm, viewing it as a "next level" from selling marijuana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>. He only saw the money and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a>. It was later, when he saw the drug changing the "makeup of the community" and people he cared about falling victim, that he understood the profound negative impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. He describes this period as "exhilarating" and "adventurous," but ultimately having a side that could not be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:05">[02:36:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>.

## Prison Sentence and Reflections
[[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Harris]] received a sentence of 25 years to life, in addition to a 20-year federal sentence, totaling 33 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:05">[02:50:05]</a>. He emphasizes the reality of the criminal system and the importance of patience to avoid "a lifetime of misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:05">[02:55:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>. He views himself as a "conduit" to help others avoid the same mistakes he made, which he believes solved problems but created multiple others and negatively affected his family and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>.

While in prison, he was briefly housed on death row in San Quentin, witnessing young people younger than himself being sentenced to death, which profoundly affected him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:05">[02:36:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>. Despite his sentence, he maintained his entrepreneurial spirit, creating [[the_creation_and_influence_of_death_row_records | Death Row Records]] from behind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>. He wanted to make an impact and not let his sentence be the end of him, constantly seeking ways to "stay alive" despite his circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:05">[02:51:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>. He sees himself as trying to get back to the good parts of his past, giving back to his community something positive they can use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

Looking back, [[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Harris]] reflects on the danger of his younger years, stating that much of what he did then he is "not really proud of," especially after 33 years away and reflecting on his "quick rise and heavy fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. His calm demeanor, even after difficult experiences, stems from a conversation with God during a volatile situation, realizing the miracle of birth and the importance of living up to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:05">[05:12:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:05">[05:17:05]</a>.

> "A lot of things I did at my younger youth I'm not really proud of especially now today after being away for 33 years and and you know going through that experience and reflecting your back on on my quick rise as heavy fall but at the same time I always try to stay positive and and try to see what that Journey had to offer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>

He also learned the importance of "guarding the people that surround you" as much as the food you digest, noting that big names can suffer consequences from the actions of those in their circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:05">[05:25:05]</a>.

He acknowledges that seeing [[the_creation_and_influence_of_death_row_records | Death Row Records]] achieve significant financial success through legitimate ventures was a positive aspect, as it showed that they "can go legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:05">[04:22:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:05">[04:28:05]</a>.

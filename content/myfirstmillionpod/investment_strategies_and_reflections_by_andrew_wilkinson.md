Andrew Wilkinson, founder of [[Andrew Wilkinsons business ventures and experiences | Tiny]], has developed a unique approach to business building and [[Investment strategies and experiences | investing]] that combines aggressive early-stage experimentation with a later-stage focus on durable, profitable businesses. His journey highlights the evolution from a "business builder" to a strategic investor, influenced heavily by the principles of value [[The art of investing and Buffetts investment strategy | investing]].

## Early Entrepreneurial Approach

In his early career, Wilkinson describes himself as "Mr. business builder," embracing every idea and starting new ventures almost monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This approach was akin to "throwing spaghetti against the wall" to discover viable business models, often learning through "constant pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Running an agency, [[Andrew Wilkinsons business ventures and experiences | MetaLab]], also provided insights by observing the mistakes of various startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

His first business was fortunate enough to be profitable, which he credits with preventing him from giving up on entrepreneurship early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, starting another five to ten businesses after that proved incredibly painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This led him to "swear off starting businesses" for a period, only returning to it in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Business Classification: Easy vs. Hard

Wilkinson categorizes businesses based on their operational difficulty:
*   **Hardest Businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>:
    *   Brick and mortar operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   Those requiring movement of physical goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
    *   Businesses with many employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   Examples include bakeries, delis, and restaurants due to high employee count, early morning operations, and vulnerability to issues like sick staff or broken equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. His experience with the bakery and deli in Victoria, BC, which he's owned for five to six years, illustrates these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
    *   E-commerce businesses like H.J. Muse (cat furniture) were brutal due to razor-thin margins (2-3% EBITDA compared to 30-50% for agencies or Pixel Union) and the constant need to reinvest profits into inventory, leading to losing all initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
    *   Restaurants are particularly brutal; he learned this firsthand with his Pizzeria and bar, Famous Original, citing ego-driven overspending, wrong management, and incentives, and significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

*   **Medium Difficulty Businesses**:
    *   Agencies are considered medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. They are asset-light, requiring minimal investment (office, internet, keyboard) and allowing hiring as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. However, they demand constant balancing of supply and demand, have linear growth, and require readiness for "radical changes" during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

*   **Easiest Businesses**:
    *   Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses are highly sought after by agency owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Despite personally losing $10 million on Flow, a project management software, while competing with Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
    *   A remote job board, We Work Remotely (weworkremotely.com), acquired from Basecamp, is considered the easiest business he owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. It had great SEO and benefited from the rise of remote work, allowing a very small team to scale it into a large business with simple best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Key Businesses and Investments

### Pixel Union / WeCommerce
*   **Origin**: Started as a favor to Tumblr CEO David Karp, making Tumblr themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It began generating automatic revenue of $10,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: Shopify noticed their work and asked them to create themes for their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **First Sale**: Incubated and spun out of MetaLab, Pixel Union was sold in 2014 for $7 million when it was generating $500k in net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. At the time, he "didn't know how good the business was" or how to value it, regretting the sale later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The sale prompted him to learn about [[The art of investing and Buffetts investment strategy | investing]], particularly Warren Buffett's strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Repurchase & IPO**: He bought back his 80% stake years later for $26 million, by which point it was doing $4 million in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. After acquisitions, it was taken public as WeCommerce at a $260 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Aeropress
*   **Acquisition**: Tiny recently acquired Aeropress, a coffee product, which Wilkinson considers a business with "potential lasting impact" that could exist for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: It was a unique opportunity to acquire "a way of making coffee," comparable to buying Kleenex, due to its de facto status as a verb among coffee enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: The previous owners focused on the retail channel, with only a small percentage of sales online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Wilkinson's strategy involves applying "tons of best practices" to grow its online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. They even hired the former president of SodaStream US, who grew that business to $200 million, as Aeropress's new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection**: He notes the rare passion people have for the product when they learn he owns it, ranging from designers who appreciate Dribbble to carpenters who are enthusiastic about Aeropress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Meallime
*   **Acquisition & Sale**: Tiny bought Meallime, a fitness meal plan business, and later sold it to Albertsons for "tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Hands-off Approach**: The founder, Mitch, preferred a hands-off approach from Tiny, which Wilkinson allowed, leading to significant growth and a successful exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Selling Philosophy**: While Wilkinson generally dislikes selling businesses, he facilitated the Meallime sale because the founder desired the exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. He believes it's "hard to predict what's going to end up large" and that holding good businesses "forever" is usually better than selling, even if they are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## Evolution to a Value Investor

Wilkinson's [[Investment strategies and experiences | investment journey]] shifted significantly after the initial sale of Pixel Union. The cash pile forced him to learn how to [[Wealth building and management strategies | invest]], leading him to avidly read about [[The art of investing and Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] and value [[The art of investing and Buffetts investment strategy | investing]] for two full years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This intense dedication transformed him from knowing "nothing about any of this" to being among the "top percentile" in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

He highlights Buffett's quote, "I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a best better investor because I'm a businessman," to explain his advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. As operators, he and Chris (his partner) understood how to allocate capital within a business, which made them better investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. They can evaluate businesses with an "operational lens," identifying overlooked improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Wilkinson criticizes "spreadsheet investors" who assume margin increases are easy without understanding the human element and operational challenges involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Reflections on the Investment Industry

Wilkinson finds being a pure investor "boring," which is why he continues to start businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. He misses "getting [his] hands on the tools" and feeling the direct impact of his efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

He distinguishes between investors who "build value" (like Buffett, who influenced businesses and drove growth) and those who merely shuffle paper or index (like BlackRock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

He criticizes aspects of the venture capital industry:
*   **Rigged Game**: Venture capital is described as a "rigged game" where VCs make guaranteed money from management fees, regardless of investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. It can take 10-15 years to assess a fund's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives**: VCs are incentivized to raise larger funds (e.g., $1 billion) to collect significant management fees ($20 million/year), even if their operational costs are minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. This means they profit even if investors lose money, creating a lack of alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. Tiny's funds do not charge management fees for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.
*   **"Smart Money" Fallacy**: He cautions against relying on the "smart money" (big-name investors/firms) as a signal for good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Even highly intelligent individuals in major firms make "colossal mistakes" or "dumb bets" due to the inherent difficulty of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. He cites examples like the FTX investment by Paradigm, where $300 million was lost despite presumed diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.
*   **Legal "Stealing"**: He highlights legal but questionable practices in the Canadian stock market, where investment bankers dress up small businesses to match market trends, take them public, collect fees and warrants, and then dump shares to retail investors, resulting in significant losses for the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Tenzing: A Modern Investment Bank for Founders
Wilkinson is launching Tenzing, a modern investment banking firm focused on "bootstrapped founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Named after Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa who helped Edmund Hillary climb Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, the firm aims to be a "financial translator" and guide for founders who don't understand traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

Traditional investment bankers often don't work with startups due to smaller deal sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Tenzing aims to fill this gap for businesses doing $500k to $3 million in profit, or even $10 million ARR businesses, by connecting founders with capital options like bank credit, debt for M&A, or secondary sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. The goal is to provide aligned, long-term focused advice rather than being fee-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Wilkinson regrets not having access to such guidance when he was starting out, noting he "lit a million dollars on fire" by not knowing about R&D tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

## Non-Binary Term Sheet Concept
Wilkinson pioneered a "non-binary term sheet" for his company Supercast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This structure aimed to provide a fair valuation while hedging against binary outcomes (all or nothing) for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   **Structure**: Supercast raised money at a $10 million valuation, but the agreement stipulated that if the business didn't hit $1 million in revenue within two years, the valuation would drop to $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Supercast came close but didn't hit the revenue target, so Wilkinson voluntarily "crammed [himself] down by 50%" to ensure fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: This structure allows founders to pivot to a sustainable lifestyle business without feeling like a "piece of shit" for not delivering a venture-scale return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. It aims to prevent founders from driving businesses into the ground by pursuing futile growth paths, benefiting employees, founders, and investors by avoiding total loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. While some founders might prefer traditional venture deals for higher upfront valuations, this alternative offers a more aligned funding option for technology businesses that may not be "good venture businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

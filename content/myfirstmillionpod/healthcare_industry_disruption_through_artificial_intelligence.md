The U.S. healthcare industry is seen as one of the most disruptable businesses globally, with an estimated value of $3.5 to $4 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Despite its size, four out of five people are unhappy with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, and its costs have consistently outpaced inflation for the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This sector is described as a "carcass so tempting, so bloated, swimming so slowly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

[[challenges_and_potential_of_ai_technology | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is identified as the key force that could transform this industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## AI's Role in Healthcare Transformation

The application of [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI in healthcare]] aims to shift the industry from a reactive, defensive model to a proactive, offensive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This involves using AI to analyze a patient's comprehensive data, including:
*   Grocery receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>
*   Workout routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>
*   Healthcare records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
*   Sleep patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>

Based on this analysis, AI could provide prescriptive and proactive lifestyle, grocery, and exercise recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This would lead to a multitude of niche businesses leveraging some form of [[utilizing_ai_in_daily_business_operations | AI in healthcare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

## Investment and Entrepreneurial Opportunities

For entrepreneurs with intellectual capital and credentialing, the intersection of [[challenges_and_potential_of_ai_technology | AI and healthcare]] presents a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Example: 98.6
An example of an early-stage company in this space is 98.6, which focuses on text-based healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. This B2B company allows employees to text a service for $3 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_business_processes | AI]] assists by identifying issues, such as a rash, and then connecting the user with a dermatologist via smartphone to prescribe solutions like cream or medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## Challenges within the Sector

Despite the immense potential, the healthcare sector is recognized as very challenging due to:
*   Extensive regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>
*   Complexity of navigating insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>

However, the sheer amount of money in the category and the dissatisfaction among consumers suggest that disruption is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Nations

The U.S. spends approximately $13,000 per person on healthcare annually, yet people in the U.S. die earlier and have higher rates of obesity and depression compared to countries like the UK and Australia, which spend half as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This discrepancy highlights the inefficiency and ripe opportunity for transformation.

## Broader Economic Impact

The potential for [[impact_of_ai_and_future_trends | AI]] and related technologies to impact healthcare is profound. For example, advances in weight loss drugs like GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy) are anticipated to have a massive effect on various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. If these drugs significantly reduce obesity, it could lead to:
*   Decreased profits for food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>
*   Increased profits for airlines as passengers weigh less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>
*   A drastic reduction in obesity-related costs, which currently amount to $1.7 trillion annually in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, representing 7% of the U.S. economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   Potential for entire hospital networks to face challenges if obesity-related illnesses decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

This technological shift in healthcare is considered to have a potentially "bigger impact on the real economy than [[impact_of_ai_and_future_trends | AI]]" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

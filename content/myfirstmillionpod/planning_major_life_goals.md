As the year draws to a close, instead of traditional New Year's resolutions, Jesse Itzler proposes a comprehensive process for [[the_approach_to_deciding_whats_next_in_life_and_career | planning a "monster" year]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach aims to take control and dominate the year, rather than letting external factors dictate one's time and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Itzler, a successful entrepreneur, author, and ultra-marathoner, emphasizes the critical role of December and January in setting the stage for the subsequent 11 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Annual Review Process: Closing Out the Year

Itzler notes that businesses typically close out the year with review sessions to assess what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. He advocates for applying a similar self-review process to one's personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The overarching theme for closing out the year is to "come into the new year light," shedding baggage and feeling prepared for a fresh start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Practical Steps for "Getting Light"
Itzler's method for starting the new year "Net Zero" involves several practical steps to reduce mental and physical clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>:
*   **Decluttering Physical Spaces**: Go through closets, donating unworn clothes, and organizing personal items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Maintain a clean desk, free of stacks of papers and bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Email Bankruptcy**: Respond to necessary emails, file important ones, and delete the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The goal is to avoid feeling like you have to play catch-up at the start of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Cleanup**: Unsubscribe from unwanted emails and delete unused apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Organize Physical Files**: Create new, organized files for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Clear Vehicles**: Ensure cars are free of clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### The Power of Handwritten Letters
A key component of Itzler's year-end process is writing 20 to 30 handwritten thank-you letters to people who have impacted his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He's been doing this for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This practice serves as a genuine expression of gratitude, breaking through digital clutter and creating a lasting impression due to the personal effort involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Itzler notes that this practice offers a significant "return on investment" in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. He keeps all letters he receives in a box, which he reviews at year-end before starting a new box for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### The "Blender" Exercise: Identifying Areas for Improvement
To identify what needs to be fixed, Itzler suggests a "blender" exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Imagine putting all aspects of your life—finances, health, relationships, work, living situation—into a blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Then, rate your overall happiness and satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Immediately, the two or three things pulling your number down become clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. These are the areas that require intentional effort, as they won't magically improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The exercise is a personal assessment, not a comparison to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

## The Three-Step Planning System for a "Monster" Year
Itzler's system for the new year is based on three simple steps that, if followed, he guarantees will significantly improve one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### 1. The Misogi: One Year-Defining Thing
Inspired by an old Japanese ritual, the Misogi is one big, year-defining challenge that you commit to annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This could be a physical challenge like riding a bike across America, launching a book, starting a company, running a marathon, or even quitting smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

#### Importance of the Misogi
*   **Something to Show For**: Provides a concrete accomplishment at the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
*   **Shifts Mindset**: Having a challenging goal makes you "show up at work and at home completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Prioritization Tool**: It creates a "vehicle to say no to things" that don't align with your primary goal, as your time becomes dedicated to training or working towards that Misogi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Anticipation and Reward**: Just like children looking forward to a vacation, adults are willing to work harder when there's an exciting event or goal on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Itzler emphasizes that the goal isn't necessarily to succeed in the traditional sense, but to embrace the [[challenge_of_achieving_ambitious_goals | challenge]] and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. He also recommends breaking down large challenges into "digestible bites" to make them manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Even without a specific Misogi idea at the start of the year, simply being open to the idea of a year-defining adventure "reprograms your brain to just be aware of Adventure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

### 2. Kevin's Rule: Mini Adventures
Named after a friend, Kevin's Rule involves planning something extraordinary once every other month—six "mini adventures" a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. These are one-day or one-weekend activities that you wouldn't normally do, such as a fishing trip, a visit to college friends, or a winter hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

#### Why Mini Adventures Matter
*   **Creating Newness**: Routine can make life comfortable but also hard to create newness. Planning these mini-adventures ensures new experiences, which are crucial for relationships, momentum, enthusiasm, and [[personal_development_and_growth | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Playing Life on Offense**: Rather than letting your calendar fill up with others' requests, proactively scheduling these adventures ensures you prioritize your own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Time Management and Balance**: It ensures a healthy work-life balance by carving out dedicated time for personal enrichment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Itzler emphasizes that these adventures don't have to be expensive. Many opportunities for adventure exist in national parks, rivers, mountains, and oceans, often costing very little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. "Winning isn't always about getting first place; sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

### 3. Winning Habits: Adding One Per Quarter
Instead of overwhelming New Year's resolutions, Itzler suggests adding one "winning habit" each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. These are small, actionable habits that contribute to a winning routine and mindset, such as drinking 100 ounces of water daily, never being late to a meeting, or starting a 10-minute meditation practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. Over time, these habits accumulate, profoundly impacting one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

## Implementation and Mindset

### Visual Planning with a "Big Ass Calendar"
Itzler uses a large, one-page calendar to visually map out his entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. He immediately writes down all major events: school dates, camp dates, family trips, and quarterly date nights with his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

> "If you put the sand in first, you can't put any of the rocks in... versus if you put the rocks in first and then you could pour as much sand will fit all the way around it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.

This metaphor highlights the importance of prioritizing significant life experiences ("rocks") by scheduling them first, allowing smaller appointments and tasks ("sand") to fill in around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This method helps Itzler see "where [his] gaps are" for more time and track progress toward goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

### Cultivating a "Time Rich" Life
Itzler defines being "time rich" as having the luxury of time to do things spontaneously, even without being financially wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. He learned from successful individuals that taking dedicated time for oneself each day, even in cumulative segments, leads to showing up better as a parent, partner, or CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. [[time_management_and_life_optimization | Being time rich]] means being organized, scheduled, and allocating time to prioritize yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

### Daily "Vitamins"
Similar to how Flintstone Vitamins provide all daily needs in one pill, Itzler has his own version of "daily vitamins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. These are 10 non-negotiable activities that make him feel strong, such as saunas, cold plunges, running, playing with his kids, or taking walks with his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. He aims to incorporate two or three of these "vitamins" into his day to ensure he shows up fully for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

### The Urgency of Now
A core tenet of Itzler's philosophy is the importance of acting now, rather than delaying [[the_importance_of_focused_life_goals_and_seasons | focused life goals]] for an unspecified future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. He warns against wasting years, as life circumstances can change unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. He cites the example from the book *Die With Zero*, where delaying a backpacking trip from age 23 to 33 resulted in a significantly different and less fulfilling experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. "It's never the right time... you have to make it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. Saying yes to adventure, even with sacrifices, prevents regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

By adopting these principles, one can map out an incredible year, becoming the "Jason Bourne" of their own life – highly capable and intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This intentional approach helps in [[finding_and_pursuing_personal_purpose | finding and pursuing personal purpose]] and [[overcoming_early_career_traps_and_making_strategic_career_choices | making strategic life choices]] that lead to a fulfilling existence, rather than simply letting time pass by.

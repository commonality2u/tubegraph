This article explores how small businesses, often run by one or two individuals, can achieve significant success by identifying and dominating unique niches. These "mighty businesses" prioritize high profitability and often fly under the radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## The Rise of Mighty Businesses
The inspiration for examining these businesses came from the sale of Wargraphs, a company developed by a single individual, for \$54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Wargraphs built a companion app for "League of Legends" that tracked player stats, gained popularity with a million users, and generated substantial revenue before its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

### Defining "Mighty Businesses"
While the term "one or two employees" can be vague, the spirit of these businesses is that they are driven by one or two core individuals who may utilize contractors, vendors, or agencies for other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:09">[05:07:09]</a>. They typically lack a large employee base, company t-shirts, or a traditional office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>.

## Notable Examples of Niche Dominators

*   **StreamYard**: Two individuals scaled this online streaming platform to \$30 million in revenue within 18 months, largely due to the pandemic's demand for virtual events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:02">[09:12:02]</a>.

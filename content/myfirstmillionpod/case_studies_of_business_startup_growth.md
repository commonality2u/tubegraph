This article explores various strategies and [[Entrepreneurial Success Stories | entrepreneurial success stories]] detailing how different businesses acquired their first 100 customers and gained initial momentum. The focus is on the "step one" of business growth, emphasizing practical methods used at the very beginning of a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## How to Get Your First 100 Customers

The journey to scale a business begins with securing initial customers. Here are several approaches discussed:

### Bunk: Roommate Matching App (Website Version)

Bunk, a roommate matching website, started as a "Tinder for roommates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Piggybacking & Event Hosting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
    *   The team identified San Francisco's transient population who struggled to afford one-bedroom apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
    *   They targeted landlords with multi-bedroom apartments and offered to host events at their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
    *   Individual room ads were placed on Craigslist using HTML to create visually appealing listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. These ads explicitly stated it was a room in a multi-bedroom apartment and invited interested individuals to a party/event to team up with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   This strategy generated approximately 10,000 users per week to their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, resulting in about $50,000 in sales within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Leverage existing platforms with high search volume (like Craigslist) and offer a unique, value-driven experience (events) to attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This method is similar to how Airbnb gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

### Sushi Restaurant Chain (Delivery-Only)

This venture was a delivery-only sushi restaurant chain, operating from a commissary kitchen rented at $9-19 an hour to avoid long leases and high upfront costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Floor-to-Floor Sales & No-Risk Offer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>
    *   With no DoorDash or Uber Eats available, the founder went downtown, targeting skyscrapers for density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
    *   The strategy involved approaching the front desk lady or office manager—the "local influencer" within the office—to inquire about office catering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
    *   A compelling, risk-free offer was presented: a free sample tray for the office manager and colleagues to try. If they liked it, a menu would be left; if not, no problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
    *   This approach led to profitability in month one, with revenues of $13,000, growing to around $30,000 in the first month and more in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Direct, brute-force outreach can be effective. Identify gatekeepers or influencers, refine your pitch, and offer a zero-risk proposition to overcome initial trust barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. The business was later discontinued as the founders realized the delivery model was the real opportunity, not necessarily sushi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:10]</a>. This is an example of [[Early business experiences and challenges | early business experiences and challenges]] and pivoting.

### The Anti MBA: Business Book Club

This book club was initiated by placing an ad on Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.
*   **Method: The Magnet (Niche Filtering)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>
    *   By advertising a business book club, the founder created a "selective filter" that attracted a highly specific audience: "business nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
    *   This niche approach led to 10,000 people signing up to an email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Focus on a hyper-niche to attract a highly engaged audience, who are often the most valuable early adopters. This showcases [[Entrepreneurship and early success | entrepreneurship and early success]].

### Roommates: Roommate Matching App (Acquired from Bunk)

After Bunk was acquired, it was transformed into the app "Roommates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Made to Stick / Niches Make Riches** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>
    *   Inspired by the book "Made to Stick," the team created highly shareable, niche-specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
    *   They launched in multiple cities (LA, Chicago, Boston, New York, San Francisco) and created infographics titled "Typical Roommates of [City/Neighborhood]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
    *   These infographics humorously characterized residents of specific neighborhoods, including where they shop, eat, and funny quotes they might say (often gleaned from Yelp) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
    *   The content was shared on social media, tagging relevant businesses and locations, which led to significant organic sharing by locals who resonated with the humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.
    *   This viral content generated approximately 100,000 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Create content that is hyper-relevant and emotionally engaging for a specific niche, making it highly shareable. Mentioning local brands and creating an "us vs. them" dynamic (tribalism) can boost engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>. This is an [[Innovative marketing strategies for startup growth | innovative marketing strategy]].

### Biotech Clean Energy: Microbe-Based Natural Gas Production

This biotech startup aimed to produce natural gas from underground coal using naturally occurring microbes, avoiding mining and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.
*   **Method: No-Risk Offer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>
    *   The challenge was finding landowners willing to allow experimental drilling on their property for a speculative technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
    *   They targeted owners of "stranded coal"—coal deposits that were uneconomical to mine using traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
    *   The offer was completely risk-free for the landowner: "We will do this all at our cost... but if it works, we want a share of the upside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
    *   This approach led to five interested customers, one of whom eventually offered $5 million for the technology rights and land, plus a share of the upside if it worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** For new companies lacking trust or a track record, a zero-downside, all-upside offer can bypass significant friction and attract early customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. This is a common strategy used by others like Alex Hormozi (Gym Launch) and Main Street (R&D tax credits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. This represents an [[Unexpected Business Ventures and Case Studies | unexpected business venture]].

### Hustle Con: Conference Series

Hustle Con was a conference series focused on business topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Content Marketing & Speaker Amplification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>
    *   The founder wrote blog posts every Tuesday and Thursday, focusing on each of the eight speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>.
    *   These articles were then shared on platforms like Hacker News and Reddit, targeting specific subreddits where the content would resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
    *   The website had a mandatory email sign-up to view full details or purchase tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. Emails were collected and used in a cyclical marketing strategy, sending new blog posts to existing subscribers to encourage sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.
    *   By making the speaker look like a "hero" in the articles, speakers and their companies would share the content, leading to internal and external virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.
    *   This strategy generated 1,000 website visitors on the first day and eventually 2,000-5,000 daily visitors, leading to 10,000 email subscribers and significant revenue for the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** High-quality, targeted content can be a powerful customer acquisition tool. Leveraging speakers/partners for amplification and creating a seamless email capture and nurturing cycle can drive significant early traffic and conversions.

### Shephard: Hiring Agency

Shephard is a hiring agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a> that grew to eight figures in profit in less than four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Personal Story Tactic & Vulnerability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>
    *   The founder announced the launch on Twitter to a small but engaged following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>.
    *   He then sent a newsletter telling a personal story about his own business struggles with high costs and how he discovered the solution: hiring overseas for significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of pitching the solution directly, he pitched the problem he experienced and revealed his vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>.
    *   This story-driven approach led to an 11% click-through rate on his newsletter (compared to a typical 1-3% for ads), with 1,300 people clicking the link to the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Authentic personal stories that resonate with a shared problem can be far more effective than direct advertising, building trust and generating high engagement. Ryan Hoover used a similar "how I got 1,000 customers" story for Product Hunt to secure press coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:45:00">[34:45:00]</a>.

### Beer Hunt: Craft Beer App

Beer Hunt was an app designed for tracking and reviewing different beers, similar to Foursquare for beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Pissing in the Pond & Booth Babes (Spectacle at Events)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>
    *   Instead of targeting a mass market, the team focused on a "small but hyper-obsessed" niche: craft beer enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.
    *   They attended a craft beer tasting festival, dressed in Oktoberfest attire, to create a memorable presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>.
    *   At the event, they created a branded scavenger hunt related to the festival, offering a prize like a year's supply of craft beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>. Participants submitted their email addresses upon completion.
    *   This generated 1,400 leads of highly engaged craft beer enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>, who became the first users to download and actively use the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Focus on niches ("riches in niches") where an audience is already hyper-obsessed and actively participates in related events. Create an engaging, interactive experience at these events to capture leads and drive initial adoption.

### Trends.co: Paid Research Newsletter

Trends.co is a paid research newsletter that was doing $400,000-500,000 a month in sales with 20,000 users 18 months after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:04:00">[45:04:00]</a>.
*   **Method: Pre-Sales & Audience Leveraging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>
    *   The founder created a Gumroad page with a brief story, drawing a parallel to Jeff Bezos identifying the internet's growth trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.
    *   He offered lifetime access for $100, significantly discounted from the planned $300 annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[46:28:00]</a>.
    *   Initial users were acquired by emailing the 300 most engaged users from his existing "The Hustle" newsletter (which had millions of subscribers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. This generated $60,000 in pre-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48:00">[46:48:00]</a>.
    *   He then personally called all 100 initial customers to understand their expectations and used this feedback to shape the first reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:00">[47:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** If an audience exists, leverage it for initial pre-sales and product validation. Engaging directly with early adopters provides invaluable feedback for product development. This illustrates [[Entrepreneurial Success Stories | entrepreneurial success stories]].

### The Milk Road: Crypto Newsletter

The Milk Road is a daily crypto newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:20:00">[49:20:00]</a>.
*   **Method: The David Blaine Method (Spectacle & Build in Public)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>
    *   To "juice" the launch beyond a simple announcement, the founder engaged in a public stunt: he put $1 million into a crypto wallet and publicly tracked his attempt to turn it into $10 million through trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>.
    *   This created a compelling storyline with high stakes ("watch me lose money" or "watch me kick ass") that attracted subscribers regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.
    *   This taps into the "build in public" trend, where companies share internal metrics or processes, but with an added element of calling a shot or a challenging goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Takeaway:** Create a captivating narrative around your business that includes a clear goal, obstacles, and stakes. This generates curiosity and engagement, encouraging people to follow the journey. This is an [[Innovative marketing strategies for startup growth | innovative marketing strategy]].

## General Principles for Acquiring First Customers

Beyond specific tactics, several overarching principles emerge from these [[acquiring_first_customers_for_startup_businesses | acquiring first customers for startup businesses]] case studies:
*   **Leverage Existing Platforms:** Don't try to build an audience from scratch if you can tap into established communities or marketplaces.
*   **Go Where Your Customers Are:** Whether it's online forums, specific physical locations, or existing email lists, identify and target your ideal users directly.
*   **Niche Down:** Focus on a specific, passionate audience rather than the broad market. Hyper-obsessed users are more likely to become advocates.
*   **Offer Value & Reduce Risk:** Provide a clear benefit or a compelling, risk-free offer that makes it easy for potential customers to try your product or service.
*   **Tell Your Story:** Personal, authentic narratives can build trust and resonate more deeply than traditional advertising.
*   **Create Spectacle/Build in Public:** Generate excitement and curiosity by setting ambitious goals, sharing your journey, or performing public demonstrations of your product's potential.

These [[Entrepreneurial Success Stories | success stories and lessons in entrepreneurship]] highlight that initial customer acquisition often requires creativity, direct engagement, and a deep understanding of your target audience's needs and desires.

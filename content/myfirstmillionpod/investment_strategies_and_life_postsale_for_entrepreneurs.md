Austin Rief, founder of Morning Brew, shares his journey as an entrepreneur, from starting a newsletter in college to selling a portion of his company. He also provides insights into his [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | wealth building and management strategies]] post-sale, his [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | investment strategies and decision-making in startups]], and his outlook on future ventures.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey & Sale

### Early Days & Growth
Austin Rief and Alex Liberman started Morning Brew while at the University of Michigan. What began as a PDF attached to an email called "Market Corner" evolved into a full-fledged newsletter [00:01:09]. Rief applied to Duke but didn't get in, ending up at Michigan where he initially planned to follow the herd into corporate finance or Investment Banking [00:00:34].

Their age difference played a significant role in their initial success; because Rief was in college and Alex was two years older, they didn't pursue venture capital funding, unlike contemporaries like BuzzFeed and Vice in 2015 [00:01:34]. Alex went to work at Morgan Stanley, and Austin interned in Investment Banking, finding it "miserable" [00:01:53]. This experience pushed Austin to commit full-time to Morning Brew, with his parents only agreeing if he completed his senior year of college [00:02:19].

Morning Brew and The Hustle (founded by Sam Parr, the interviewer) were often compared, creating a competitive dynamic between the two companies [00:03:55]. Austin admitted to initially "hating" Sam, turning The Hustle into an "enemy" to motivate his team [00:03:21]. This rivalry drove intense focus within Morning Brew, with daily comparisons of newsletter content and open rates [00:06:40]. Austin described their daily mantra as "write, grow, sell" [00:07:27].

Morning Brew pursued a horizontal growth strategy by launching multiple newsletters, leading to quicker revenue growth, primarily through advertising [00:08:18]. This approach allowed them to reach $70-$75 million in revenue with double-digit profit margins and 250 employees [00:00:10].

### The Sale of Morning Brew
Morning Brew sold a majority portion of its business for approximately a $70 million valuation [00:02:54]. Austin was 25 years old at the time of the sale [00:32:04].

### Post-Sale Reflections
Austin describes the experience of the wire hitting his account as "unbelievably anticlimactic," as he was living in his childhood bedroom during COVID [00:03:41]. Despite the initial feeling, he emphasizes the importance of a "quick win" early in life for building "swagger" and confidence [00:34:37].

He has no regrets about selling, stating that taking "half your chips off the table" is a good strategy for entrepreneurs [00:41:30]. This approach provided him with "life-changing money" and a "nest egg," allowing him to sleep well at night, while still retaining enough upside to remain excited and driven by the company's future potential [00:41:51].

### Spending Philosophy
Austin has not made any extravagant "splurge purchases" following the sale, choosing an Acura over a Mercedes, and opting for a pre-owned car [00:42:40]. He emphasizes spending on things he truly values, like increasing his rent, traveling, and staying at nice hotels, rather than material possessions that provide little utility in New York City, such as an expensive car that would sit in a parking lot [00:43:19]. He references Remit Sethi's "rich life" concept, focusing on experiences and comfort rather than ostentatious displays of wealth [00:43:31]. He prioritizes maintaining wealth to avoid the negative feeling of losing fame or money [00:44:28].

### [[Investment strategies and experiences | Investment Portfolio Breakdown]]
Austin's personal [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment strategies and experiences]] are largely conservative:
*   **85-90%** of his funds are in "very, very boring stuff" like the S&P 500, Vanguard target date funds (e.g., 2065), real estate, and bonds [00:44:54].
*   **5-7%** is allocated to crypto [00:45:17].
*   **5%** is in venture investing [00:45:20].

He highlights the benefit of hiring a wealth management team to guide his [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment strategies and experiences]] and prevent impulsive decisions [00:45:10].

### Framework for Economic Downturns
In current economic times, Austin suggests a framework for new business ideas:
*   **Save companies money:** During periods of abundant capital, companies focused on growth. Now, they are prioritizing cost preservation [00:46:00].
*   **Help individuals earn side income:** People are now trading their time for money [00:46:27].

### [[Investment strategies and venture creation | New Business Opportunities]]

#### Outsourced Talent Agencies
Austin sees a strong opportunity in outsourced talent agencies [00:46:44]. He became a co-owner in a business called Oceans, which sources talent from Sri Lanka, including US graduates, for tech startups [00:46:47]. He believes companies are questioning the need for full-time employees (FTEs) and are looking for flexible, niche marketplaces for talent, such as content marketing or finance professionals for B2B companies [00:47:22]. These services help companies preserve money and can be very profitable if bootstrapped [00:47:50].

#### Niche Newsletters (Morning Brew for X)
Austin believes the "Morning Brew for X" model is the "biggest opportunity" for new newsletters [00:12:02]. This involves finding a growing industry and building a distinct brand within that niche [00:12:05]. He suggests that if "X" is a B2B or professional field (e.g., finance, HR), it works better than consumer-focused niches like fly fishing or basketball, unless targeting high-dollar consumers (e.g., "newsletter for Ferrari owners") [00:12:17].

#### AI Side Projects / Holding Companies
Austin suggests that "Morning Brew or The Hustle for AI" will be huge [00:50:02]. He sees an opportunity to create a small holding company that invests in and acquires small AI side projects built by entrepreneurs [00:51:17]. These projects, often generating $50K-$150K in annual recurring revenue (ARR), could be cross-promoted and bundled, forming a portfolio of AI tools [00:51:25].

> "You have this portfolio of 10, 20, 30 little AI tools and maybe each one is half a million or a million of ARR, but altogether you can get pretty big pretty quickly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>

However, Sam Parr expresses skepticism about the durability of these businesses due to the rapid pace of change in AI (Lindy effect) and the potential for consolidation or obsolescence of tools built on top of foundational models [00:53:12]. Austin shares this skepticism regarding direct [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment strategies and experiences]] in companies merely building on top of OpenAI [00:55:20].

## Future Outlook
Austin envisions a "barbell" approach to his future career [01:14:55]. He either wants to have passive income and work casually (20-25 hours a week) or go "all in" on a venture with the potential for "multiple billions" [01:15:01]. He does not want to operate in the "middle game" of businesses that only offer a "double" return [01:15:20].

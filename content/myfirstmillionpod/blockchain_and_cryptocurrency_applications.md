Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are enabling new applications beyond traditional finance, influencing media, education, and even urban development.

## Core Concepts of Crypto
The fundamental innovation of crypto lies in its ability to enable [[investment_in_cryptocurrencies_and_potential_of_blockchainbased_linkedin | value transfer online]], unlike earlier social networks that only allowed status transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on decentralized ledgers, offering "open state and open execution" where the database and every operation's execution can be tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. This contrasts with centralized APIs (like Twitter's or Facebook's) that can be unilaterally shut off, leading to business model destruction for applications built on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>.

A core design decision of Bitcoin is that extra computation increases the system's security, not just the number of transactions per second, which was a foreign concept in traditional distributed system scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Initially, the public nature of all blockchain addresses seemed counterintuitive, but pseudonymity and later zero-knowledge proofs (like in Zcash) address privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.

## Applications in Practice
### Earning and Learning (1729.com)
A key application is the concept of a "newsletter that pays you," exemplified by 1729.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This platform provides micro-tasks, such as creating memes to promote crypto in India, where participants can earn Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The goal is to allow users to not just waste time online, but to learn, earn, and build "crypto credentials" in their digital wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. These credentials, like badges for completing Python problems or Russian history questions, could eventually replace traditional college diplomas by providing a granular, verifiable portfolio of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. In this model, individuals could log into a job board and be automatically qualified based on their verifiable credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Media and Truth
Blockchain technology offers a path to "decentralized truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This vision involves:
*   **Crypto Oracles**: These act as sensors, broadcasting verifiable data onto the blockchain (e.g., weather channels reporting temperature, hospitals posting medical records, real estate transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. This allows for cryptographically verifiable facts and an unalterable digital history of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Advocates**: Humans interpret and narrate these raw, verifiable facts. The "selection function" of which facts are cited becomes transparent, allowing for quantifiable editorial judgment and the ability to see what was omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Science**: This concept applies the principles of independent replication (critical to true science, unlike mere peer review) to digital data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>. With code and data sets on-chain, anyone with a computer can independently replicate calculations and verify claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:30">[02:14:30]</a>. Blockchain transactions, with their "independent confirmations" by miners, are analogous to independent replications in science, offering a quantifiable and checkable basis for assertions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:44">[02:16:44]</a>. This model can make science "far more checkable and cumulative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:03">[02:19:03]</a>.

### Shifting Power Centers
The rise of crypto challenges established institutions:
*   **Finance**: [[macro_investing_strategies_and_crypto_adoption | Crypto Adoption]] is disrupting traditional finance, with decentralized finance (DeFi) building on the concept of traceable digital property and goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
*   **Law**: Smart contracts on the blockchain can replace elements of traditional legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56">[01:30:56]</a>.
*   **Journalism**: Crypto oracles and decentralized truth systems challenge the role of traditional journalism schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Government/Leadership**: The founders and operators of large, multi-billion or trillion-dollar crypto networks act as "heads of networks," influencing monetary policy and potentially displacing traditional heads of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>. These founders often embody "quantifiable alignment" with their users, as participants opt into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>.

### Social Networks
Decentralized social networks are emerging, building social graphs with economic incentives. Big Cloud (DeSo) is cited as an example that used economic incentives to attract high-status individuals, allowing users to buy and benefit from the popularity of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. The fundamental difference from traditional social networks like Twitter or Facebook is that they offer "open state and open execution," meaning the social graph and its underlying data are accessible and auditable, allowing any social network to be built on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>.

### Digital Nomadism and Startup Cities
Digital nomadism and international migration are poised for significant growth, especially post-vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>. Tools facilitating easy, low-cost international relocation will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a>. The concept of "startup cities" (cities that foster startups, cities that act like startups, and cities that are startups themselves) is emerging, with Miami as an example of a city acting like a startup to attract talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. The rise of remote work means "longitude rather than latitude is now the organizing principle," leading to "longitudinal arbitrage" where people can work from lower-cost time zones aligned with their employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>.

The internet is "breaking geography," meaning geographical proximity no longer guarantees cultural proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. This leads to the invalidation of traditional city and nation-state premises, with cloud communities potentially materializing into physical "cloud cities" and eventually "cloud countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. Crypto is a big component of this because these cloud communities can have their own currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Investment Strategy
A pragmatic approach to investing involves focusing on long-term goals while being pragmatic in the short run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. This means investing in areas that advance the desired future, even if some highly profitable opportunities are foregone if they don't align with this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

Early [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | investment in cryptocurrencies]] like Bitcoin and Ethereum proved highly successful, with the ability of Bitcoin to recover from a 90%+ crash in 2011 cementing its "staying power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Key investment areas for the future include:
*   **Genomics and Biomedicine**: While not yet fully integrated with mainstream tech, it's a significant area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Robotics**: Robotics is transforming labor into capital by automating tasks, leading to value creation online that can then be "printed out" through robotic invocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.
*   **Relocation/Migration Tools**: Companies focused on permanent international migration and digital nomadism will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>.
*   **Startup Cities**: These are seen as the "bitcoin of 2010" for the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Work
A "pragmatic ideologue" approach involves having a long-term goal (e.g., transhumanism and transcendence) but being pragmatic in short-term execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. This means choosing to work on things that have meaning along the way, while also leading to a greater, long-term purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

The world is increasingly favoring "night people who are asynchronous" and those who can generate diverse, differentiated content, moving away from the routinization and homogeneity of the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Ideas and their ability to shape the world are becoming more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.

It is crucial to embrace continuous learning, treating every conversation as an opportunity to be taught something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:33">[02:00:33]</a>. This also applies to hiring, where observable writing, interests, values, and character from platforms like Twitter provide more signal than traditional diplomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>.

Physical health is an important component of long-term productivity and value creation, akin to avoiding technical debt in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:36">[02:30:36]</a>. Investing in self-care, including exercise and proper eating, is a "straight line with transhumanism and with reversing aging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:17">[02:32:17]</a>.

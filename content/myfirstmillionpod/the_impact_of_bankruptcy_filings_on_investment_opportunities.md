## Distressed Assets as the Best Asset Class

Investing in [[investment_strategies_and_distressed_assets | distressed assets]] is considered the best asset class, surpassing mezzanine, public company investing, and growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This sector is often overlooked because it is perceived as "unsexy" and "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The general rule is: the sexier an investment, the lower the returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. [[investment_strategies_and_distressed_assets | Distressed investing]] "smells like piss" and "reeks of death," which deters most investors, making it less competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### FTX Bankruptcy Claims

An [[examples_of_great_investment_opportunities | investment opportunity]] arose when FTX went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The investor, known for reading bankruptcy filings, identified that FTX had made a $500 million investment in Anthropic, which was estimated to be worth around $40 billion at the time of the bankruptcy filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. With approximately $8 billion in claims against FTX, the Anthropic stake alone was believed to cover 50 cents on the dollar for creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The investor bought $10 million worth of claims against bankrupt FTX for $2.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This was done by contacting Thomas Brazelle, who made a market in these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The process involved due diligence to verify ownership and legal transfer of claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Due to a surge in cryptocurrency values, the investment was projected to return 160 cents on the dollar, turning $2.5 million into $15 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> "It's better to be lucky than good. Crypto took off. Everything they had invested in went crazy. And it looks like we're going to get 160 cents on the dollar." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

### Enjoy (Vaping Company) Turnaround

Another successful [[investment_strategies_and_distressed_assets | distressed asset]] investment was in Enjoy, an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The company had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The investor partnered with Jason Mudrick of Mudrick Capital, a distressed credit shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. They brought Enjoy out of bankruptcy at a valuation of $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

The investment faced significant challenges, including negative public perception of vaping (e.g., "popcorn lung" incidents linked to black market liquids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The investor even resigned from the board due to ethical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. However, the strategy focused on the regulatory aspect, positioning Enjoy as a "least bad actor" in the space, targeting smokers wanting to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Enjoy spent $100-$120 million on FDA approval, ultimately becoming one of the few companies to receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This regulatory success led to the company's sale for $2.2 billion to Altria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The investor's initial $2.5 million investment yielded a 30x return, translating to $75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Dex Media (Yellow Pages) Transformation

Another successful [[investment_strategies_and_distressed_assets | distressed asset]] investment involved Dex Media, a Yellow Pages company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Although the business was declining by 12% annually, it generated $600 million in revenue and $280 million in EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The strategy involved consolidating yellow pages companies (e.g., in Canada and Australia), cutting costs by closing headquarters, and retaining the best salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This made the business cash-flow generative as long as costs were cut faster than the revenue decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

The management team successfully transitioned the company from a Yellow Pages business to a CRM software company, leveraging its relationships with small and medium-sized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The stock, initially bought at $2-$3 per share, rose to $15-$20, resulting in a 4-5x return for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Distressed Investing

*   **Embrace the "Unsexy":** The most profitable [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | investment experiences]] often come from industries or assets that are unattractive or perceived as "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Skill and Luck:** While some success is attributed to luck (e.g., crypto surge for FTX claims), significant skill, homework, and diligence are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Access to Deal Flow:** Personal success and reputation can provide access to unique [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | deal flow]] that is unavailable to average investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Human Capital Investment:** Applying this principle to human capital, choosing a less glamorous but stable profession (e.g., tax law) can offer greater financial returns compared to a "sexy" but highly competitive field (e.g., acting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** While investing in exotic or individual stocks can be appealing, for most young people without extraordinary niche knowledge or [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | deal flow]], diversified index funds are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Broader Investment and Market Outlook

The investor suggests a potential shift in capital flows, with a "massive outflow" from the US market into non-US markets, especially Europe, where companies are trading at lower P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. This is based on the idea of "regression to the mean" after an unprecedented 14-15 year bull run in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

Residential real estate for rental is also highlighted as a strong long-term investment, offering leverage, depreciation benefits, and less daily volatility compared to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. High-end residential real estate in "super cities" (e.g., Dubai, London, Palm Beach, Aspen, New York) is seen as a strategic allocation due to increasing income inequality and limited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

> "If you have financial capital, invest in the unsexy shit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>
> "I have been massively transitioning my US holdings into Asian, European, and also the only companies I invest in have at least 50% of their business abroad because I think the US has is about to go into a 10 or 15-year down cycle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>

The **Trumpcoin** is cited as an example of concerning [[investment_and_retail_market_trends | market trends]] and potential grift, illustrating how a small group can profit significantly while retail investors lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. This contributes to a broader concern about income inequality and corruption impacting public confidence in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

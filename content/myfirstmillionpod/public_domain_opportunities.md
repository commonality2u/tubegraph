The concept of the public domain offers significant opportunities for creators and entrepreneurs. It refers to a realm where creative works and intellectual property are no longer protected by copyright and can be freely used, adapted, and distributed by anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

## What is the Public Domain?

Works enter the public domain after a period of copyright protection expires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. For many creative works, copyright generally lasts for the death of the creator plus at least 50 years, though this can be extended to 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. The rationale behind this expiration is that the public benefits from works eventually entering a free market, preventing perpetual capitalization by a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

Examples of works already in the public domain include ancient texts like the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

## Tracking Public Domain Releases

A website called Public Domain Review (publicdomainreview.org) tracks intellectual property as it moves into the public domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This site provides an interesting browse experience and can be used to identify upcoming opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. It currently receives about 500,000 page views a month and monetizes by selling art prints and collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

## Business Opportunities

When creative works enter the public domain, they open up new avenues for [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | business ventures]] and [[leveraging_intellectual_property | leveraging intellectual property]].

### Winnie the Pooh

A notable example is Winnie the Pooh, the book for which entered the public domain in January 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This presents an opportunity to take the Winnie the Pooh book, modernize it, and resell it to new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

The discussion also raises questions about merchandise:
*   Major franchises like Pok√©mon, Hello Kitty, and Winnie the Pooh have generated over $80 billion in merchandise sales alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   Similarly, for properties like Mickey Mouse and Star Wars, the bulk of the money is made from merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   It is important to determine if the public domain status applies only to the book's specific IP or if it includes rights to associated merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

### Food Timeline Website

Another interesting case is foodtimeline.org, a website created by librarian and food historian Lynne Oliver in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. The site chronologically lists the first known citations of various foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. As of September 2020, due to Oliver's passing in 2015, the site's domain was set to lapse in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. This presents a unique opportunity for someone to potentially acquire and revitalize a domain with existing, significant traffic (over 150,000 page views a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

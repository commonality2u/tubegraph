Pornhub, the sixth most trafficked website in the United States with three billion monthly visits, has a complex and turbulent ownership history likened to a "Game of Thrones-style story for Tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Its ownership has been plagued by legal battles, financial pressures, and shadowy dealings.

## The Early Landscape and Disruption
Before 2005, most porn sites operated as directories of links, similar to Yahoo, directing users to other websites for photos or videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The launch of YouTube in 2005 revolutionized online video hosting, making it easy to upload and share videos in one central location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This led to the emergence of copycat porn sites like RedTube and YouPorn, which were flooded with pirated content, mirroring the early days of file-sharing services like LimeWire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

These new sites offered a superior user experience: they were more private, instantaneous, provided infinite variety and niches, and were free, in stark contrast to the dominant paid content model of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## The Fall of the "King of Porn"
Vivid Entertainment, a Hollywood-style porn studio, was considered the "King of Porn" during this period, generating tens of millions in revenue from DVD sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. However, the rise of free online content caused their revenue to plummet by 50-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. In response, Vivid copied Viacom's strategy against YouTube by aggressively suing these new video platforms for copyright infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## [[the_origin_of_pornhub_and_its_founding_story | Pornhub's Founding and Early Growth]]
Pornhub's journey began with three Canadian college students who met at a competitive foosball tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The best programmer among them, Matthew Keizer, developed live streaming video technology for their foosball competitions before realizing its potential for porn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. They initially created hundreds of directory sites linking to other porn websites, but upon seeing YouTube's success, they decided to host videos directly on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

In the same office, they created Pornhub and a content production company called Brazzers. This dual structure allowed them to produce their own content, which wasn't subject to piracy lawsuits, giving them an edge over competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Importantly, the link between Brazzers and Pornhub was kept secret, with the Brazzers CEO publicly denouncing platforms that gave away content for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

The company grew rapidly, bootstrapping from three friends to 250 employees by 2009, making millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. A key to their [[the_business_model_and_growth_strategy_of_pornhub_and_similar_sites | growth strategy]] was Keizer's SEO expertise, allowing them to rank number one for "porn" and "sex" on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. They also began a private equity-style rollup, acquiring smaller, lawsuit-fearing competitors cheaply to consolidate power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This industry, though seemingly sketchy, involved sophisticated deals, with a Stanford MBA student, for example, acquiring a VHS tape exchange using a leveraged buyout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

## The Burden of the Throne: Stress and Sale
By 2009, the founders became paranoid due to the immense scale and controversial nature of their business. They experienced a $9 million government seizure of a bank account, hired 24/7 security, and were followed by black-tinted SUVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Keizer, the SEO expert, quit due to the stress, walking away from substantial money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

Feeling the pressure, they decided to cash out. Finding institutional buyers was difficult due to the asset's controversial nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. They sold the company for $140 million to Fabian Thylmann, a German businessman who would go on to own MindGeek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

## Fabian Thylmann's Reign and Financial Mysteries
Fabian Thylmann, a programming genius, started his career tracking internet traffic and company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. He noticed the popularity of porn websites and built an affiliate tracking tool for them, which became the industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. After selling this company and becoming wealthy, he acquired Pornhub.

Thylmann proved to be a highly effective operator, reportedly doubling profits in three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. He invested $1 million in content licensing rights to mitigate legal issues, launched PR campaigns around safe sex, and engaged with politicians to legitimize the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. He also attempted to build a broader media empire by acquiring sites like Celebs.com and trying to create a TMZ-like platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. His data scientists even optimized the paywall placement, finding that 2 minutes and 59 seconds was the optimal video duration to prompt impulsive purchases from free users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.

However, questions arose about how he funded such massive acquisitions. It was later revealed he secured a $362 million loan from 125 secret lenders, with one known group being ex-bankers who left their jobs specifically to lend to him at a staggering 20% interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. This meant his interest payments alone were $60-100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>. The high stakes manifested in a physical attack, with the CEO's $16 million house being burned down by arsonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Crusade and Payment Processor Cutoffs
Investor Bill Ackman, inspired by a *New York Times* article about a teenage girl whose nude photos were leaked and could not be removed from these sites, began a crusade against Pornhub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. Unable to directly pressure an offshore, privately owned company, he decided to cut off their financial lifeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

Ackman immediately texted the CEO of Visa, highlighting their complicity in enabling such content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. Within five minutes, Visa's CEO agreed to address the issue, leading to Visa and MasterCard cutting off payment processing for Pornhub shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This forced Pornhub to implement stricter verification policies for content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. Ackman publicly encouraged victims of Pornhub to seek compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

## Thylmann's Forced Sale and Current Ownership
A few years into his ownership, Fabian Thylmann encountered tax troubles in Germany, leading to a forced fire sale of MindGeek (including Pornhub) for a surprisingly low $77 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. This low valuation was puzzling, given Pornhub's immense traffic (2 billion visits/month, 10-minute average duration, 10 pages per visit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.

The official story of the sale was that two executives bought it out, but it was later revealed that the true money behind the acquisition was a shadowy Austrian businessman named Bernard Bergmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>. Bergmar, who had a finance background at Goldman Sachs and previously owned RedTube, structured the deal to obscure profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. He reportedly lent money to the company, taking out $2 million a month in debt payments himself, and shifted revenue across various shell companies to officiate its true earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. Currently, Bergmar is facing a divorce, with his wife pushing him to cut ties with the company, suggesting another ownership change is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.

The current owners are a private equity group named Ethical Capital Partners, formed specifically to acquire Pornhub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

Working within the adult entertainment industry, even at a corporate level, presents unique challenges. The process of optimizing metrics and revenue streams can become abstracted away, causing employees to lose sight of the controversial nature of the underlying content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>. This phenomenon, where the focus shifts entirely to numbers and growth, can lead to an "existential crisis" for those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>. As one speaker reflected, "You gotta be really careful what projects you pick because anything can be in optimized to infinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.

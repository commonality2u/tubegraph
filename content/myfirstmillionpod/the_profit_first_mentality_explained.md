The "Profit First" mentality is a business approach that reorders how a company allocates its revenue, prioritizing profit from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This contrasts with traditional accounting, where profit is what's left after all expenses are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Andrew Wilkinson, founder of Tiny, notes that this concept can significantly impact business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Core Principle of Profit First

The fundamental idea is to allocate a predetermined percentage of gross profit to a separate "profit bank account" *before* covering other expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This involves literally moving the money out of the company's operating account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Psychological Impact
The system leverages [[the_psychology_of_financial_success_and_humility | psychological principles]] to encourage leaner operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
Andrew uses the analogy of eating from a smaller plate to lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. By immediately removing a portion of revenue for profit, businesses are "forced to eat off a smaller plate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, leading to more thoughtful spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. When funds for expenses have to be pulled back from the "profit pocket," it forces a critical evaluation of each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This contrasts with the "waterfall of expenses" where businesses might accept all costs without scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Implementation and Cash Management
A key aspect of Profit First is determining how much cash to keep in the business. Andrew and his partner Chris, for their holding company Tiny, sometimes leave only two weeks' worth of expenses in their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:46]</a>. This creates a "sense of urgency" for efficient operations and collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:04]</a>.

While this may seem stressful, the idea is that money can always be put back into the operating account if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:36]</a>. The discipline it instills outweighs the minor inconvenience of occasional capital injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:41]</a>. This approach is particularly effective for bootstrapped companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:13]</a> and predictable recurring revenue businesses like SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Contrasting Profit First with Traditional Practices

Traditionally, businesses often aim for a certain profit margin, such as 25%, and manage to that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:41]</a>. However, Andrew has observed businesses that could operate at 80% or 90% net profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:50]</a>. Without the Profit First discipline, these high-profit businesses might see CEOs "burn through all that cash" on innovations or new initiatives, even if they don't yield proportional returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:16:01]</a>.

### The "Dinner Guests" Analogy
A seasoned entrepreneur once told Andrew, "If you ask the dinner guests what's for dinner, they will always say steak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:30]</a>. This illustrates that employees, including CEOs, may be more inclined to spend company money (like ordering steak) because it's not their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:36]</a>. Even if a $300,000 expenditure only results in a $10,000-$20,000 bonus for them, they might not care as much as an owner-operator would about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:54]</a>.

This concept extends beyond business to personal finance, as exemplified by a real estate agent who needed a modified incentive structure to push for a higher sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:34]</a>. The initial 3% commission wasn't enough to motivate the extra effort for a marginal gain when the overall commission was already substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:32]</a>.

## Real-World Application

Sam, one of the podcast hosts, plans to implement the Profit First mentality in his e-commerce business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:11]</a>. He noted that even though he was initially skeptical, the clarity of the idea was undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:54]</a>.

This shift in strategy aligns with [[core_principles_for_achieving_financial_success | principles of financial success]] by instilling a disciplined approach to cash flow and expense management, ultimately aiming to maximize profit rather than treating it as an afterthought.

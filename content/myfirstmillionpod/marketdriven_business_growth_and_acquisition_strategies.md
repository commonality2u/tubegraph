Andrew Wilkinson, owner of Tiny, shares insights on [[advice_on_business_growth_and_investment | business growth]], [[making_strategic_acquisitions_for_growth | acquisition strategies]], and financial management, drawing from his experience growing Tiny to a $600 million market cap company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His approach emphasizes finding efficiency and leverage in often "unsexy" areas of business.

## "Sexy" vs. "Non-Sexy" Businesses and Growth

Wilkinson notes that young entrepreneurs often seek to build "sexy" businesses, but he has found that the most profitable and sustainable growth comes from focusing on "boring" aspects of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Examples of "Non-Sexy" Strategies
*   **Price Increases:** One company increased prices by 30% after five years, leading to massive profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Similarly, "Birthday Alarm," a reminder service, increased its annual price from $9 to $25, significantly boosting profits without a major product overhaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction:** A company reduced shipping costs by resizing packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Assets:** Utilizing strong SEO for certain keywords to drive affiliate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Financial Optimization:** Investing customer gift card deposits in T-bills to earn 5% interest, generating an extra $500,000 annually in pure profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Another example involved enabling a Stripe feature for a 25-cent fee that automatically updated expired credit cards, leading to an extra million dollars a year in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Wilkinson contrasts his experience with a bakery/deli business, which has 30-40 employees, complex operations (e.g., bakers waking at 2 AM), and significant swings in profitability, sometimes only making $150,000 a year if lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. In contrast, "We Work Remotely," a job board acquired by Tiny, had only two employees and one or two part-time contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This "easy mode" business went from $400,000 in profit to $4 million in profit by adjusting pricing, hiring an SEO consultant, and implementing email marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## The "Profit First" Mentality

The "Profit First" philosophy, which Wilkinson encourages his CEOs to read, reverses the traditional profit calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Instead of profit being what's left after all expenses, profit is taken out first.

*   **Process:** When revenue is generated, a portion (e.g., 30% for a business with a historical 30% net profit margin) is immediately swept into a separate "profit bank" account, outside the company's operational funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Psychological Impact:** This forces businesses to operate off a "smaller plate," making them more thoughtful and disciplined about expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. It counteracts the tendency for CEOs to overspend when cash is readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Cash Reserves:** For predictable recurring revenue businesses, only two to four weeks' worth of payroll and expenses might be kept in the operating account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This creates a sense of urgency for collections and efficient operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. While Tiny, as a parent company, can inject capital if needed, the internal discipline remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## [[business_acquisition_strategies | Business Acquisition Strategies]]

Wilkinson's approach to [[making_strategic_acquisitions_for_growth | making strategic acquisitions for growth]] has evolved.

*   **Sales Funnel:** While early on it involved cold outreach, Tiny now prefers to build a public presence and reputation so that sellers approach them directly, rather than engaging in a "dog and pony show" of pitching themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Efficiency in Deal-Making:** To avoid wasting time, Wilkinson quickly ascertains key information: who runs the business (do they want to stay or go?), and what are the earnings? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a> Based on this, they provide an approximate offer to gauge interest before spending significant time on due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   **Letters of Intent (LOIs):** They frequently issue non-binding LOIs to formalize offers and ensure sellers take them seriously, even if the deal ultimately doesn't close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

### Case Study: Pixel Union
Wilkinson initially started Pixel Union, a Shopify theme design business, with an investment of approximately $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. He sold it for about $7 million due to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Later, after studying competitive advantages and moats, he realized the business's inherent value and bought it back for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. With an additional $10 million in M&A, the total investment amounted to approximately $36 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. The business was then taken public at a $260 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

## "Be the Barnacle on the Whale" - [[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startup_growth | Marketing Strategy]]

This strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating marketing costs by attaching a business to a larger, established platform ("the whale") that already has massive reach and customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Marketing typically accounts for 15-30% of business costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. By operating within an ecosystem that provides free marketing, a business can achieve profit margins of 45-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.
*   **Example (Pixel Union):** Wilkinson's company developed themes for Shopify's marketplace, leveraging Shopify's marketing efforts to generate sales for their themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. As Shopify grew and invested hundreds of millions in marketing, Pixel Union continued to grow without needing its own extensive marketing budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** This strategy is ideal for saturated markets or new ecosystems like Discord or other software platforms that are not yet oversaturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

## Life Philosophies in Business

*   **People Suffer in Silence:** Wilkinson observes that CEOs, especially those accustomed to oversight, may "fester in silence" if left alone, assuming a lack of communication from leadership implies negative intent rather than busy-ness or autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. He attributes this to "Hanlon's Razor" â€“ never attributing to malice what can be explained by ignorance or stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>.
*   **People Don't Change (Often):** Wilkinson generally believes people rarely change unless they hit "rock bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. He advises assuming people will not change when making decisions, to avoid making bad choices based on hopeful expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. This applies to hiring (e.g., hiring for "high pace" rather than trying to coach it in) and dealing with challenging ideas (where people tend to double down when challenged due to "commitment and consistency bias") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Networking and Value Creation

Wilkinson is a master networker, proactively seeking connections with influential people by offering value.

*   **Shooting Your Shot:** He cold-emailed Dan Gilbert (Quicken Loans, Rocket Mortgage) by highlighting shared interests like owning a bakery, passion for his city, and bootstrapping his business, leading to a meeting and a tour of Detroit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Investment in Relationships:** To meet Bill Ackman (hedge fund manager), he first offered his design agency's services for Chipotle (Ackman's investment), then later bid $57,000 for a charity lunch with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. This led to a business deal years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. He also communicated with Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner) through letters, understanding Munger's preferred communication style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Earning the Room:** Wilkinson emphasizes the importance of "earning the room" rather than buying one's way in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He recalls an uncomfortable experience at the Vanity Fair Oscars Afterparty, where he felt out of place as he had no shared language or value to offer the celebrities present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. He notes that acquiring Letterboxd, a social network for film buffs, would now give him relevant value in such a setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

### Peter Attia and Psychological Incentives
Wilkinson also discusses his experience with Dr. Peter Attia's private medical practice. Attia's practice psychologically tests potential patients and once flagged Wilkinson for potential lack of follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. This perceived risk of being "booted out" made Wilkinson a highly compliant and disciplined patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. This illustrates the power of creating a sense of something to lose, especially for successful individuals who rarely hear "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.

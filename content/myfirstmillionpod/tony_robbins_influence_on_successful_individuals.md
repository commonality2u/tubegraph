His business empire generates $7 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Elite Clientele and Their Edge

[[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] coaches a roster of highly successful individuals across various fields, including:
*   Top athletes such as Serena Williams, Tom Brady, and Conor McGregor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Politicians like Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Leading traders and investors, including Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

These high-profile clients pay him because they believe he can provide them with an "edge" and help them "level up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. His approach is seen as a way to gain significant advantage in their respective fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[Personal transformation through Tony Robbins events | Personal Transformation Through Events]]

The host of the podcast, who attended a [[personal_transformation_through_tony_robbins_events | Tony Robbins event]] eight years prior, described it as life-changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He initially resisted the "self-help seminar" label but found himself transformed into a "happier guy" who developed a clear plan and strategy for his life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. After the event, he made three specific shifts that contributed to his financial success, reaching his first million and later building companies projected to do $50 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

During the event, the host observed other successful individuals, including celebrities like Gerard Butler and Vanessa Hudgens, fully engaging in the experience, dispelling any initial skepticism about its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. One attendee, who had been to five events, likened [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] to "Michael Jordan of public speaking" due to his consistent peak performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Learning from the Best: Mentors and Coaching

[[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] emphasizes immersion as a core learning strategy, believing that the best way to learn is to fully engage all senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. He seeks out and models "the very best in the world" in various fields, often starting by working for them to understand their mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### Jim Rohn's Influence
[[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]]'s journey into personal development began at 17, when he was a part-time janitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He attended a seminar by Jim Rohn, who taught him to "work harder on yourself than you do on your job" and to "add more value than anybody else in the marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This principle became the foundation for every company [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Reciprocal Learning from Clients
[[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] notes that he learns significantly from the successful individuals he coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Marc Benioff (Salesforce)**: Benioff attended [[personal_transformation_through_tony_robbins_events | Tony Robbins's seminars]] four times and decided to leave Oracle to start Salesforce.com after being influenced by [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Though Benioff calls him a coach, [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] states he learned as much, if not more, from Benioff's entrepreneurial journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Peter Guber**: A partner in sports teams like the Golden State Warriors and LA Dodgers, Peter Guber taught [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] the principle of "Proximity Is Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Guber advised [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] to spend time with people in the specific fields he wished to excel in, leading to significant financial opportunities like a $50 million deal and later a $400 million public company conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This principle suggests that being in the environment of the world's best, and adding value, accelerates success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## [[The psychology of financial success and humility | Financial and Lifestyle Insights from Successful Entrepreneurs]]

[[Tony Robbins new book and investment strategies | Tony Robbins]]'s book, "The Holy Grail of Investing," stemmed from his interviews with 50 of the world's most successful self-made billionaires and investors, including Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, and Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. He sought to understand their strategies for creating wealth, especially in challenging economic times.

### Asymmetrical Risk Reward
One key principle highlighted is "asymmetrical risk reward," where the potential downside is minimal, and the upside is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
*   **Kyle Bass and Nickels**: Billionaire investor Kyle Bass explained this concept by buying millions of nickels because the cost of making a nickel (11 cents) was higher than its face value (5 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. He considered it an investment with no downside and a guaranteed 30% return from its "meltdown value" alone, even if regulations prevented melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Richard Branson and Virgin Airlines**: Sir Richard Branson negotiated a deal with Boeing that allowed Virgin Airlines to return all purchased jets within a year without financial penalty if the business wasn't profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This created a scenario of "zero downside, only upside" for his venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

### The Holy Grail of Investing: Uncorrelated Investments
Ray Dalio shared what he considers the "Holy Grail of Investing": finding 8 to 12 uncorrelated investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. This strategy can reduce risk by 80% while slightly increasing upside, by investing in assets that do not move in tandem, such as stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Private Equity and Sports Teams
[[Tony Robbins new book and investment strategies | Tony Robbins]]'s research for his latest book uncovered that private equity has historically outperformed public markets, with average private equity returns of 14.2% compounded annually over 35 years compared to the S&P 500's 9.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. The ultra-high net worth individuals allocate 40-44% of their assets to private equity and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. Private equity firms, often the wealthiest people, thrive due to their long-term money commitments (typically five years), allowing them to buy low, improve companies, and sell high without forced liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

Sports teams represent another uncorrelated asset class that performs well during inflationary times and have evolved into media enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
*   **LA Dodgers**: Peter Guber's group bought the Dodgers for $2 billion, which was initially deemed a "crazy buy," but then sold local TV rights for $7 billion, generating a $5 billion profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Jordan and Charlotte Hornets**: Michael Jordan bought the Charlotte Hornets for $275 million and sold it for $3 billion 12.5 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

Over the last decade, professional sports leagues (NBA, MLB, Soccer, Hockey) have averaged 18% compounded returns, outperforming the S&P 500's 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] himself is now a partner in teams like the Dodgers, Warriors, Red Sox, and Pittsburgh Penguins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

## [[Tony Robbins on giving and philanthropy | The Importance of Giving]]

[[Tony Robbins on giving and philanthropy | Tony Robbins]] has provided over a billion meals to those in need, driven by his own childhood experience of not having enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. He stresses that giving should not be delayed until one is rich, as it transforms one out of a "scarcity mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

A personal story from [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] illustrates this: at 24, broke with only about $20, he gave his remaining money to a young boy who impressed him with his manners at a salad bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. The next morning, he received an unexpected $1,200 repayment for an old loan, an amount that could sustain him for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. This experience solidified his belief that "when I had nothing, I gave everything," and since that day, he has never felt scarcity again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

Sir John Templeton, a self-made billionaire investor, shared that the secret to wealth is gratitude and that he had never met anyone who tithed (gave away 10% of earnings) for at least 10 years who didn't become wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. [[Tony Robbins coaching method and philosophy | Tony Robbins]] states he has given away 17% of his earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

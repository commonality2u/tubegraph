The journey to [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | building a successful startup]] often involves perseverance through numerous challenges, learning from successive iterations, and a deep understanding of market needs. For Christina Cacioppo, founder of Vanta, this path was characterized by not "counting yourself out" and embracing an iterative approach before achieving multi-billion dollar success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Quitting a Good Job and Early Ambitions

Despite having a "good job" at USV, a venture capital firm, Cacioppo felt a strong desire to "make things" rather than be an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. She saved her bonus and planned to live off it while teaching herself to code and make products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This decision was met with skepticism, with many questioning why she would leave a desirable position at USV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. One person even remarked that the "usb.com" part of her email address was more powerful than her name, implying she was "betting on the left side" (her own name) by leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

To maintain discipline and structure during this self-learning period, Cacioppo treated her self-employment like a regular job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. She dressed for work, went to a friend's newly opened office space across from her old one, and sat with engineers, teaching herself to code through tutorials and online resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## The Iterative Path to Success

Cacioppo's initial projects were not immediate successes; she worked on "35 projects that went nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This period aligns with the philosophy that "the function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

### The "Bad Art" Philosophy
This concept, from the book *The Art of Fear*, suggests that creative projects, including startups, often require many initial attempts that might not be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. It's about getting through the "muddy water of bad ideas and bad skills at the beginning" to eventually find clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. This iterative approach is crucial for [[prioritizing_tasks_for_startup_success | prioritizing tasks for startup success]] and avoiding the trap of over-planning without testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.

The "marshmallow test" analogy further emphasizes this point: kids often succeed more than adults in building the tallest tower because they test the riskiest assumption (the marshmallow's weight) early, rather than saving it for the end after extensive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

Many initial projects were "art projects" rather than businesses, lacking commercial viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. This experience of building "35 things wrong" led to baking commercial viability into Vanta from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Validating Market Needs

After her initial self-learning period, Cacioppo joined Dropbox to gain experience working at a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. It was there that she identified the problem Vanta would solve. During the launch of Dropbox Paper, the team faced a roadblock due to the lack of SOC 2 compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. While Dropbox had a security team to address this, Cacioppo realized that average startups did not, highlighting a significant market gap in security for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>.

Instead of immediately coding a solution, she validated the idea with an Excel spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. She approached YC startups, asking if they would value her doing this for them, receiving confirmation of the need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. This practical validation approach is critical for [[advice_for_startup_founders_from_industry_experts | advice for startup founders from industry experts]].

### Customer Validation: The "Mom Test"
To avoid false positives when validating ideas, Cacioppo recommends:
*   **Look for immediate commitment:** Anything other than "can you do this for me now, tomorrow, next week?" is a "hard no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. Polite rejections like "maybe next quarter" or "my friend might need it" are often disguised nos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.
*   **Expand your network:** Start by talking to anyone willing to speak (co-workers, former co-workers) and then ask for referrals, making it easy for them to connect you (e.g., providing a customizable email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on problems, not solutions:** Following "The Mom Test" principle, questions should initially focus on the customer's problem, not your proposed solution, to avoid leading them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:00">[32:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. Avoid yes/no questions and maintain rapport by adopting their terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>.

## Initial Growth and Marketing Strategies

Vanta's early growth involved a combination of tactics:
*   **Cold outbound emails:** Cacioppo sent emails to Y Combinator founders, framing it as seeking feedback, but with the intention of pitching Vanta towards the end of the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>.
*   **Word-of-mouth:** They actively sought to build a brand association where "SOC 2" in founder or VC slack channels would lead to someone recommending "Vanta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.
*   **Podcast advertising:** Initially skeptical, Cacioppo found podcast advertising to be highly effective in the early days and still works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.

## Founder Psychology and Resilience

[[developing_a_successful_company_culture | Managing one's own psychology]] is paramount for startup founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. Cacioppo emphasizes knowing what makes you "feel like you" and not giving those things up, no matter how busy you get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. For her, this includes running and reading, the latter being a lifelong habit that feels centering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. She even continues to take a bus to work to create dedicated time for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

### Managing Self-Doubt
During her two years of building projects that went nowhere, Cacioppo used a personal Google Form, filling it out every weekend to track her work, feelings, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. The most important question was "what would make you stop working on what you're working on right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. This allowed her past self to set stopping points for her present self, preventing stubbornness from prolonging unproductive efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

### High Standards and Progress
While outwardly Vanta maintains a "10% crazy" image for brand perception, internally, high standards are maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>. This creates an environment where people are "into what they do, getting better every day, care a lot," which can be infectious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. The mindset is to always push past "no" and assume anything is possible if the desire is strong enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>.

Progress, rather than static goal achievement, is seen as the key to happiness. Continually moving the "goal posts" allows for sustained progress and enjoyment of the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.

## Fundraising Approach

Vanta initially pursued a strategy of delayed fundraising, reaching $10 million in ARR before raising a Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>. They deliberately kept their success low-key to avoid competitors "knocking off" their idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:13:00">[44:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>. When they finally pitched, their substantial growth surprised many investors who had underestimated their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:00">[44:47:00]</a>.

Cacioppo's negotiation style is characterized by confidence and an unwillingness to "blink" or "swerve" if she believes in the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>. This unwavering stance comes from genuinely being "happy to sit there and wait" for the right terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48:00">[46:48:00]</a>.

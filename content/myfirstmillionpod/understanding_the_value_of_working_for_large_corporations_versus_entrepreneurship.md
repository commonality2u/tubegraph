Scott Galloway, an accomplished entrepreneur who has started nine businesses and sold one for over $100 million, offers insights into different career paths, emphasizing the value of both entrepreneurship and working for large corporations, depending on an individual's circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He also shares his personal financial journey, including significant successes and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Scott Galloway's Financial and Entrepreneurial Journey

Galloway is notably transparent about his finances, believing that open discussion about money is crucial to demystify wealth and challenge incumbent decorum that keeps the poor and middle class under illusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

He recounts losing significant wealth on multiple occasions, including an instance where he lost "pretty much everything" when a company he founded, Red Envelope, went public on NASDAQ in 2002 but later declared Chapter 11 in 2008 due to various misfortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Despite these setbacks, he was able to start again because he consistently lived below his means and avoided debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

His "big win" was selling L2 for $158 million in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. As the largest equity owner, he and the top six employees owned approximately 70% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Despite this success, he still feels financially insecure, worries about recessions, and maintains a scarcity mindset, attributing this anxiety to his upbringing and past losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He actively gives away all his current income, aiming to catch up for his non-philanthropic earlier life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Galloway highlights that he has made more money from [[comparison_between_entrepreneurship_and_investing | investing]] than from his [[early_entrepreneurship_and_diverse_business_ventures | businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of financial literacy, understanding interest rates, and consistently saving by living below one's means to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

> "The key to my success is rejection... my skill is my ability to endure that and move on and not let lose my sense of enthusiasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
> "The wonderful thing about America is that we don't embrace failure but we tolerate it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

## Entrepreneurship vs. Corporate Employment

Galloway cautions against the over-romanticization of entrepreneurship, noting that career advice is often situational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. He dislikes "hustle culture" that suggests extreme measures like carrying Jeff Bezos's bags, as such options are not feasible for everyone, like a single mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### For Non-Credentialed Individuals
If he were 25 years old without a traditional college degree, Galloway would focus on buying existing small businesses from aging Baby Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. These businesses, often generating between $500,000 and $10 million annually, lack succession strategies as owners hit their 60s and 70s and their children often pursue different careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. He suggests being "scrappy" and proposing a slow acquisition over five years, potentially using the seller's capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

### For Credentialed Individuals
For those with a degree from an elite university, Galloway advises working for a large platform or a big US multinational conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. He asserts that going to work for a big company is "vastly underrated" because these companies can leverage their monopoly positions to create immense wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. He emphasizes that a US corporation is "the greatest wealth creating vehicle in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. These environments offer financial security, opportunities to meet mentors, and a path to get rich slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

## Future Business Opportunities

### AI and Healthcare
For credentialed entrepreneurs who can raise capital, Galloway identifies the intersection of AI and healthcare as the most "disruptable business in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. US Healthcare is a $3.5 to $4 trillion industry where four out of five people are unhappy, and costs have outpaced inflation for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. He sees AI as the "fists of stone" that will transform healthcare from a defensive to an offensive industry, enabling proactive lifestyle and health recommendations based on personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. He mentions being an investor in 98.6, a text-based healthcare company, though he notes it has lost 80% of its value so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Despite regulatory challenges and insurance complexities, he believes the sheer size and inefficiency of the US healthcare market make it ripe for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### GLP-1 Drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy)
Galloway is particularly excited about GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, calling them "bigger than GPT-4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. He believes these drugs, which moderate cravings, could be a "scaffolding" to update human instincts that are out of sync with modern industrial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. He suggests they could address issues beyond weight loss, such as alcoholism, overeating, and even compulsive behaviors like excessive social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

He predicts significant economic impacts, such as food companies losing money due to reduced consumption and airlines making more money as people weigh less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. The Milken Institute estimates obesity-related costs at $1.7 trillion annually, and a drastic reduction in obesity could lead to a 7% cost cut for the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Galloway believes GLP-1 technology could have a greater impact on the real economy than AI, which he considers "overhyped" from an investor's standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. He acknowledges potential downsides of these drugs, including muscle loss and a need for continuous dosage increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

## Scott Galloway: The Brand

Galloway finds being "Scott Galloway the brand" and a public speaker incredibly rewarding, enjoying the positive affirmation from strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. He notes that speaking is his most lucrative business, with 30 engagements averaging $112,000 each annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

He dedicates significant effort to his talks, spending up to three months with a team of analysts at Prop G to develop themes, data, humor, and video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. He believes that to command high fees, one must provide unique insights and data rather than just charm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. He also uses humor to "soften the beach for new ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

Galloway acknowledges his public predictions and criticisms of companies and cryptocurrencies often draw intense, sometimes anonymous, backlash from investors with financial stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. He believes accountability is important for those who make predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

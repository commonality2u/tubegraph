When seeking a co-founder, certain key traits are crucial for a successful business and a harmonious partnership. Sam Par and the host discuss their perspectives on what makes a good co-founder, highlighting emotional stability, integrity, energy, and intelligence.

## Emotional Stability
One of the most important traits in a co-founder is emotional health and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Sam, who considers himself "mostly stable on the big things" despite fluctuating moods, emphasizes the need for a partner who is emotionally stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This stability helps maintain a functional partnership, avoiding irrational behavior that can challenge a business relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Sam relates this to choosing a life partner, noting that he married someone very stable and even-keeled, which proved to be a "perfect" match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Honesty and Integrity
High integrity is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. A co-founder must be "incredibly honest" and even prone to underselling themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Sam states that if he discovers any dishonesty, "even on small things," it's "game over" for the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The host reinforces this by noting that a smart person with low integrity is merely a "crook," and it's only a matter of time until they cause problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## High Energy and Enthusiasm
Co-founders should possess high energy and a desire to "push the pace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The host considers energy the most overlooked trait, placing it as a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This refers to whether a person brings "enthusiasm by default" or constantly needs external motivation to be high-energy, motivated, or optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Sam enjoys being the "catalyst" and "igniter," preferring partners who can then guide the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The host dislikes low-energy meetings where "nobody's fighting but also nobody's saying anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Intelligence
While often prioritized, intelligence is also a crucial trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Partners should be "really smart" and competent to avoid driving each other "nuts in the long run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This is part of the "energy, integrity, and intelligence" framework often paraphrased from Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

## Compatibility and Self-Awareness
Understanding one's own "weirdness" is key to picking a compatible partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The idea is that everyone has their unique eccentricities, and successful partnerships involve finding someone whose "version of crazy" you can deal with, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. It's important to recognize your own quirks and select a co-founder who is fundamentally compatible with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Sam's ideal partners make him feel both "intimidated and inspired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Red Flags
A major red flag is emotional instability, likened to a "crazy" partner in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Any instance of lying, "even on small things," immediately signals a broken partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. A lack of inherent enthusiasm and constant need for external motivation also indicates a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

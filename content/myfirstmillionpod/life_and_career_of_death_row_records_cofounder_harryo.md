Michael Harris, widely known as Harry O, is a successful entrepreneur and the cofounder of [[the_creation_and_influence_of_death_row_records | Death Row Records]]. Born in Los Angeles, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, Harris's journey began with early business ventures and a keen eye for opportunity.

## Early Entrepreneurship

By the age of 26, Harry O had established 11 different businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. His first major business was a limousine service, which he started around 23 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This highly profitable venture grew to include about 30 luxury cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He strategically advertised, and when demand exceeded his capacity, he would "farm out" excess business to other limousine companies, earning 50% of the service fee for initiating the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

His diverse portfolio of businesses also included:
*   A construction company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
*   Multiple production companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
*   Music companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
*   Beauty salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>
*   Real estate investment companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>

Harry O also produced concerts and plays and supported various clubs in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. At its peak, his "empire" employed between 100 and 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a> and generated millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. He reinvested his earnings primarily into real estate, acquiring 30 to 40 buildings, including rehab properties, luxury properties, and business outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Early Lessons in Business

Harris's entrepreneurial spirit emerged at a young age. He began working before junior high, at around 11 to 13 years old, at a shoeshine parlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This experience taught him about competition and business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. He learned to listen to diverse customers, ranging from preachers to business owners and people from the street, observing different approaches to business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. He also learned the importance of not judging a book by its cover, realizing that appearances could be deceiving in terms of customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

He consistently sought lessons from every experience, asking, "How do I use this moving forward? What's the lesson learned here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. His mother, who owned a restaurant, also significantly influenced him. He witnessed her navigate the business, handle customers, manage staff, and rise from an employee to owning the establishment, leaving a profound effect on his understanding of effective business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Foray into Entertainment

Harris's entry into the entertainment industry stemmed from his business ventures. He opened a studio called "The Jingle Factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, initially creating commercials for local businesses and radio stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This brought him into contact with musicians, producers, and singers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. Concurrently, his limousine service worked with many production companies and artists, further immersing him in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. He later worked behind the scenes with Motown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

He established his own production company, "Why Not Production," to support artists who lacked financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. He also ventured into play production, seeing it as a creative space for actors between film jobs and an opportunity to bring entertainment to his community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. He produced a play called "Checkmate" by Ron Milner, working with director Woody King and actors like Paul Winfield, Vanessa Williams, Richard Lawson, Ruby Dee, and Al Freeman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This play eventually made it to Broadway with Anita L. Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

As a managing partner in his investments, Harris made it a point to deeply understand each business by learning from everyone involved, combining their expertise with his management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. In his 20s, working with established professionals, he maintained a "straight up" and respectful demeanor, which helped overcome any initial perceptions of intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

## Legal Troubles and Incarceration

Harris's life took a dramatic turn when he was arrested for attempted murder and drug conspiracy just as his Broadway play was about to fully launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. He was later exonerated of the attempted murder charge after 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. He admitted guilt to the drug charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>, acknowledging his past involvement in the drug business, which at one point generated close to two million dollars a day in cocaine sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

He reflected on the destructive impact of his drug dealing on his community, realizing that what made him rich was also "making me poor in spirit and in a culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. He was sentenced to 25 years to life, plus an additional 20 years from federal charges, amounting to 33 years of incarceration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of patience to avoid "a lifetime of misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.

While in prison, Harris remained enterprising and refused to let his sentence be "the end of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. He sought ways to stay engaged and impactful despite his circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>.

## The Birth of Death Row Records

Even while incarcerated, Harry O maintained his involvement in the entertainment business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. The idea for [[the_creation_and_influence_of_death_row_records | Death Row Records]] stemmed from the discontent of [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] with Ruthless Records, where Harris felt [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre's]] value was overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. Suge Knight, who began managing [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]], introduced Harris to [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] and Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>.

Together, they initially created Godfather Entertainment, which then evolved into Death Row Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>. Harris came up with the name "Godfather Entertainment," and the name "Death Row" was inspired by his brief housing on death row in San Quentin, where he witnessed young people being sentenced to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>. His attorney, David Kenner, was instrumental in helping assemble the company while Harris was behind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>. His ex-wife, Lydia, was also part of the initial management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

Death Row Records, though not a large label, was incredibly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>. The collaboration between [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] and Snoop Dogg was a "game changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>. The first song that solidified Death Row's potential for Harris was "187 on the Other Cop" by Snoop Dogg and [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] from "The Deep Cover" soundtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:00">[39:34:00]</a>.

Key artists on the label included:
*   [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>
*   Snoop Dogg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>
*   Tupac Shakur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>
*   Female artists like Rage and Jewel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>
*   The Dog Pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>

The label's debut album, [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre's]] "The Chronic" (1992), sold three million copies quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:00">[42:07:00]</a>. This was followed by Snoop Dogg's "Doggystyle," which sold nearly seven million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>, and Tupac's "All Eyez on Me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:22:00">[42:22:00]</a>. Death Row Records changed the game for many rappers and had significant impacts on major companies like Universal (increasing distribution due to Death Row) and Warner Brothers (almost exiting the music business due to mishandling their relationship with the label) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>.

Despite being in prison, Harry O was proud to see a legitimate venture achieve such success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34:00">[43:34:00]</a>. He observed the artists like Snoop Dogg and [[dr_dre_career_and_impact | Dr. Dre]] effortlessly create music, reflecting on their work ethic and ultimate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Death Row's Trajectory and Influence

While Harry O believes Suge Knight was creative and in the "right place at the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>, he considers Suge's "implosion" and pulling away from opportunities a tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>. Harris emphasized the original intent of Death Row was enterprising and to provide a voice for communities that were often unheard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>. He describes the music as "reality rap," acting as a "CNN or a Fox News" for communities to express their experiences, especially concerning police brutality and injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:43:00">[37:43:00]</a>.

He acknowledges the challenges of managing creative individuals with a "wild side," but notes that many, like Snoop Dogg, have evolved into philanthropists with charities and foundations, mentoring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:22:00">[49:22:00]</a>.

Harry O considers Death Row Records his most impactful career achievement so far, with its global recognition and influence across different societal classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. He particularly admires artists like Tupac for their artistry, their focus on real issues, and their ability to be "flawed characters who were mostly good" and capable of redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>. He views the energy and sound of hip-hop as infectious, providing motivation and fuel regardless of one's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:24:00">[54:24:00]</a>.

## Current and Future Endeavors

Harry O is now the CEO of the new Death Row Records, which he helped create decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. He is also involved in programs like The Last Mile, co-founded by his friend Chris and Chris's wife Beverly, which teaches coding to incarcerated individuals to prepare them for jobs in the tech world upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:24:00">[59:24:00]</a>. Harris attributes his calm demeanor to a profound conversation with God during his incarceration, which led him to appreciate the miracle of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.

He plans to launch his own podcast to share insights from his unique experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Harry O's official Instagram is @theofficialhario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

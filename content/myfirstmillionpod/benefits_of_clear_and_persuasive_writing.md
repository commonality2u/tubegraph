Becoming a better writer is promised to be achievable within 60 minutes by focusing on the 80/20 rule – the essential knowledge needed to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The goal isn't just "great writing" in a literary sense, but rather writing that achieves desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

The hosts, having built and sold newsletter businesses for tens of millions of dollars, amassed million-person audiences through short-form writing, sold over $20 million in e-commerce products via email, and taught highly-rated writing courses, share their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Why Become a Better Writer?

### Scalable Persuasion
Writing is described as the most scalable way to persuade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. It allows one to write something once and scale its persuasive power to an infinite number of people, without needing to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This applies to various forms of writing, from short stories and blog posts to convincing someone to join a company or even securing a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Any goal involving influencing others typically requires persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Clarity of Thought
To write clearly, one must think clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Conversely, writing serves as an essential tool for achieving clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Bad writing often reveals bad thinking, while great thinking shines through good writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Writing helps clear mental fog, leading to crystal clear ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Idea Generation
Writing isn't just about communicating existing ideas; it's a powerful tool for generating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:10">[05:08:10]</a>. It acts as a "truth-tell potion," revealing the clarity of one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Paul Graham stated that when you sit down to write, you will generate new ideas, and that 80% of initial writing might be bad, requiring cuts to the good 20%, but it can also generate 50% more new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Regular writing ensures one doesn't miss out on these powerful new thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Longer form writing, in particular, makes it harder to hide bad ideas or thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Corporate Communication and Beyond
Jeff Bezos famously banned PowerPoint at Amazon, instead requiring long-form narratives or memos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. He believed that PowerPoint could create "an illusion of good thinking" through charisma or slide design, whereas long-form written word offers "no place to hide" poor thought processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This principle applies to internal company communications as well as external communications with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[improving_business_presentations_and_communication]].

## Tactics for Better Writing

### Before You Write
The work begins before a single word is typed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
1.  **Begin with the End in Mind:** Decide the desired reaction (emotion) and action from the reader, and what single sentence or takeaway they should remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Chris Quigley, who made videos go viral, worked backwards from emotions like LOL, WTF, OMG, or heartwarming, as people only share or act if they feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Headline and Sub-headline:** Start with these to clarify what will be written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. The sub-headline often serves as an outline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
3.  **Unlearn School Habits:** Forget word count minimums and fancy vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Online writing prioritizes conciseness and quickness, eliminating fluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.
4.  **Accessible Language:** Aim for a 5th to 8th-grade reading level to reach a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Tools like Hemingway App can help check reading levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. Even complex topics written by Warren Buffett are at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.
5.  **Copy Work:** A warm-up technique where you physically copy writing you admire for 10-15 minutes, ideally by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. This helps internalize the style and rhythm of effective writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.
6.  **Swipe File:** A collection of great phrases, headlines, openers, and closers to draw inspiration from when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. This is part of [[content_strategy_and_building_a_personal_brand]].

### During the Writing Process
The typical process involves drafting, incubating, and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.
1.  **Draft:** Get ideas down as fast as possible, accepting that the initial draft will be "stupid" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. The focus is on a "brain dump" rather than a polished first attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Incubate:** Take a break from the draft (e.g., walk, shower, cook) to allow passive thinking and breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. This period helps improve ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Edit:** This is where "greatness happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. David Ogilvy stated, "I'm a lousy writer but I'm a good editor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Stephen King calls it "killing your darlings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. The incubation period makes editing more effective, as improvements become obvious upon returning to the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. This addresses [[common_writing_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them]].

### Specific Writing Tips
1.  **Don't Bury the Lead:** Start with the most important, provocative statement or promise at the very top to hook the reader immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Create a "curiosity gap" to make the reader want to know the next sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. If the headline isn't juicy enough, people won't read further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Write Like You Talk:** Use natural, conversational language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Avoid jargon (like "utilize") or words you wouldn't naturally say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. As Stephen King advised, "Any word you have to hunt in a thesaurus is the wrong word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. If you can't explain an idea simply out loud to a friend, you're not ready to write about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. It's often helpful to imagine writing to just one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.
3.  **[[importance_of_storytelling_in_writing | Storytelling]]:** A more advanced skill. A good story has an "intention" (what a character wants) and an "obstacle" (what's in their way) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. The more the character wants something and the greater the obstacle, the stronger the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. Good stories also establish "stakes" – what's at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>. The true art is establishing high emotional stakes in a low-stakes environment, like a grocery store line or an HOA dispute, making relatable scenarios compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>.
4.  **Short Sentences:** By default, use short, simple sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. Warren Buffett's annual shareholder letters illustrate this, as his writing became simpler and more accessible over time, despite his businesses growing more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Rhythm and Variety:** While short sentences are key, varying sentence length creates a pleasant rhythm and keeps the reader engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:29:00">[42:29:00]</a>. Use short, medium, and occasionally long sentences for effect, like musical dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. Tactical shifts like using a period instead of a comma, or starting a new sentence with "and" or "but," can change the rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.

### Embracing Your Own Voice
The most effective writing comes from "you pushed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:49:00">[51:49:00]</a>. Rather than trying to be a different character, letting your unique thoughts and passions shine through attracts an audience who genuinely connects with your authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>. This creates a "personal monopoly" where no one can compete with you at being you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>. This is critical for [[content_strategy_and_building_a_personal_brand]].

## Early Life and Pivotal Shift

Sarah Moore's upbringing was challenging; she and her sisters were split up and moved between various homes, with inconsistent parental figures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a> As a teenager, she became "trouble," often partying, skipping school, going to jail, and showing disrespect, largely getting away with it because people felt sorry for her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a> A significant turning point came when she was living with an alcoholic woman who would frequently throw her belongings out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a> A woman named Natalie Bracken would often pick her up and let her stay at her house. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a> One day, Natalie's husband, Mr. Breet, directly confronted Sarah about her life trajectory, explaining fundamental life principles and where her path was leading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a> This conversation deeply affected her, as she felt he genuinely cared, unlike others who had previously lectured her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>

She quickly changed her ways, driven by a fear of being sent back or disappointing those who had taken a chance on her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a> Her first step was getting a job at a diner, where she studied the menu diligently. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a> She applied these new study habits to school, improving her grades significantly, from a 2.0 to all A's, aiming for at least a 3.0 GPA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>

## Path to Business

While working at the diner, a wealthy couple, Steve and his wife (the "Greens"), who were regular customers, offered her a job at their company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a> They later offered to pay for her college at Northeastern after she was waitlisted and advised to remove herself from financial aid to improve her candidacy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a> This support profoundly changed her life, as they invested in her when she felt she was the "world's worst investment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>

Initially, Sarah pursued social work and then law, aiming to "be that one person for one person" who she wished she had as a child. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a> However, she realized these professions weren't the right fit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a> Her boss, Steve, who had attended Stanford Business School, advised her that she was "geared for business" and could have a "way bigger impact in business." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a> Despite her past of paying her sister to take her SATs and starting college with a 33% reading level, she worked tirelessly to get into business school, eventually attending Harvard Business School. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>

## The Decision to Buy a Business

During her time at business school, she learned about "search funds" â€“ a concept where an individual could acquire a business and become its CEO, often with limited personal capital or experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> This idea appealed to her, particularly after observing classmates aiming for corporate roles that she found stifling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

She decided against the investor-backed search fund model because it would require paying back a significant premium (e.g., 1.5x the search capital), limiting her independence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> A friend convinced her that by "getting enough reps in" (evaluating many businesses), she would naturally recognize a good opportunity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

## The Search Process: A Numbers Game

Sarah embarked on a rigorous and unconventional search:

*   **Data Scraping**: She leveraged a smart friend to scrape a database of private companies within 1.5 hours of her Boston apartment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>
*   **Industry Agnostic Approach**: She believes that focusing too much on specific industries is overrated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> Instead, what truly matters is finding an established business that has been *consistently profitable* for a number of years, regardless of the sector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>
*   **Hiring Interns**: Without funds, she hired "hella interns" (initially five) from places like Craigslist, offering them real private equity experience and transparency by allowing them to listen in on calls with owners, brokers, and attorneys. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> To get interns into the library, she even procured fake IDs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>
*   **Mass Outreach**: Realizing that customized emails had low response rates, they shifted to a "bombs away" approach, creating an Excel file of guessed email combinations and mass-emailing a generic message that appeared customized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a> This "fake it till you make it" strategy relied on sellers "self-selecting" by responding, confirming or denying the business's basic criteria. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
*   **Criteria**: Initially, she sought businesses with $4 million to $20 million in revenue and at least $1.5 million in seller discretionary earnings (SDE), though she later lowered her expectations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a> Only about 5% of the businesses they looked at were consistently profitable and established. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>

## Acquiring EggCartons.com

Sarah's mass email reached the owner of EggCartons.com. Despite appearing like a farm or feed store, the owner's detailed and enthusiastic response indicated consistent profitability since 2001, a strong reputation, and a robust customer base. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>

The business primarily functioned as a wholesale distributor of egg cartons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a> Its simplicity appealed to her, as she wanted a business she could easily understand and operate without relying on complex technical or engineering skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>

### Negotiation and Financing

Sarah quickly proposed a tentative price range, often three to four times the business's annual profits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a> A key non-negotiable was a "seller's note," where the seller finances a portion of the purchase price over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a> This served as a substitute for equity investment, allowing her to put no money down. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>

She structured the deal with a 25% seller's note and a 75% bank note. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a> It took over 20 banks to find one that viewed the seller's note as equity (or treated it as such for their internal ratios), allowing her to secure financing with no personal cash down. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a> The bank's willingness was largely due to the business's many years of consistent profitability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>

## Growth and Operational Insights

Initially, Sarah admits to making mistakes and seeing the business decline slightly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a> Her biggest early mistake was attempting to change the phone system, which led to a week-long outage and customer confusion, highlighting the importance of not making major changes in the first year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>

She soon realized that her business wasn't just in the "egg industry" but in "specialty packaging." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a> By examining order history, she discovered that 40% of their revenue came from non-egg related customers, such as those selling crickets, roaches, small parts, bath bombs, and cupcakes, all needing "protection and separation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a> This broadened market potential, combined with proprietary products and the surge during COVID-19, allowed the business to grow "five, six-X." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a> She is now in the process of acquiring more domain names like "machine shop trays" and "bath bomb cartons" to reflect this expanded market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>

## Key Lessons and Philosophy

Sarah's [[success_stories_and_lessons_in_entrepreneurship | success stories and lessons in entrepreneurship]] are rooted in several key philosophies:

*   **"Will or Won't"**: She believes anyone who *wants* to buy and operate a small business *can* do so; it's a matter of "will or won't," not "can or can't." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>
*   **Simplicity and Trust**: She avoided jargon and overly complex structures to build trust with sellers, many of whom lacked formal business education but were highly successful in their trade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>
*   **Leveraging Disadvantages**: She intentionally used her gender as an advantage in a male-dominated brokerage community, dressing distinctively (tall, bright colors, 5-inch heels) at free networking events so brokers would remember her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   **Unconventional Marketing**: She wore a sweatshirt that read "I want to buy your business" with her number on the back, and implemented a mass faxing campaign with her picture on it, finding success in these unsaturated channels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>
*   **"Do it for the Story"**: Her mentality was that nothing was off-limits, sending a signal of total commitment to herself and her team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>
*   **Mentorship and Giving Back**: Inspired by those who took a chance on her, she aims to be "that one person for one person" through one-on-one mentorship, fostering confidence and not giving up on those who genuinely try. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>

## Public Attention and Privacy

After her story was initially shared on a podcast, it "went viral," leading to significant public attention, including outreach from Netflix and people showing up at her doorstep for advice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a> This caused both annoyance and fear for her business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> The story's incredible nature even led some to doubt its authenticity, prompting researchers to fact-check her background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>

Despite the attention, Sarah maintains a very private life, avoids social media, and rarely gives interviews. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a> She agreed to this specific interview to share detailed information for others interested in buying a business, hoping to manage the overwhelming volume of inquiries she receives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>

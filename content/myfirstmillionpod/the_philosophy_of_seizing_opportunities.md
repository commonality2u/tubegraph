Jesse Itzler, a serial entrepreneur and author, embodies a distinct [[entrepreneurial_philosophies_and_antilongterm_planning | philosophy]] centered on actively pursuing and leveraging opportunities, rather than passively waiting for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. His career, marked by diverse ventures from music jingles to private jets and consumer goods, demonstrates a consistent approach to identifying and seizing unique market [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | niches]] and building powerful partnerships.

## The "Will vs. Can" Philosophy
A cornerstone of Itzler's approach was instilled by his mentor, Lou Katz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. When Itzler was considering a deal to receive $10,000 in exchange for 10% of his future earnings, Katz challenged him with a pivotal question: "I didn't ask you can you, I said will you [make this business work without the 10 grand]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> This distinction emphasizes commitment and determination over mere capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

> "There's a big difference between 'can' and 'will.' I know you can start a podcast. I know you can be a millionaire. I know you can run a marathon. I said 'will you,' son. And I said 'yeah, Lou, I will.' He said, 'Well, tell him to take the ten thousand dollars and shove it up his ass. Don't make it work.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

This philosophy became a recurring theme throughout Itzler's life, pushing him to put himself in positions "where something incredible can happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, such as competing in an Ultraman race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Creating Opportunities through Hustle and Networking
Itzler's journey began with humble beginnings, sleeping on couches while trying to make it as a rapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. After getting dropped by his record label, he pivoted to writing jingles for sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Strategic Investments in Credibility
His first major business success with the jingle company demonstrated an early understanding of [[insights_on_investing_time_and_money_to_increase_personal_leverage | strategic investment]]:
*   He borrowed money to produce a theme song for the New York Knicks, even though the cost ($4,800) exceeded the payment ($4,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   He viewed this as the "best business model" because having the Knicks as a customer was a powerful "calling card," making it easier to secure deals with other professional sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. He would have paid $10,000 for the Knicks to be his customer because it established instant credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Leveraging Relationships and Going Above and Beyond
Itzler emphasized the power of being a "yes guy" and delivering without expecting immediate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. His encounter with the President of NetJets, Jim Jacobs, illustrates this:
*   A year before pitching Marquee Jets, Itzler helped Jacobs' daughter become a backup singer for a famous artist, earning Jacobs' trust and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   This act of generosity earned him a meeting with NetJets, despite having no aviation experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

## Identifying and Capitalizing on Unique Niches
Itzler consistently found opportunities in unconventional or underserved markets:

*   **Marquee Jets:** After experiencing private jet travel, he and his partner noticed a gap between full ownership/fractional programs and unreliable charter services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. They created a "jet card" for 25 hours of private flight, targeting customers who wanted flexibility without the full commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
    *   **Overcoming obstacles:** Initially rejected by NetJets, they didn't rely on typical presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Instead, they brought in their own "focus group" of eight potential customers (including celebrities like Carl Banks and Run from Run DMC) to personally explain why they would buy the 25-hour jet card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This direct demonstration of market demand convinced NetJets to partner with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Itzler notes that the decision-makers "wanted to bet on these two guys" because of their enthusiasm and determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
    *   Itzler attributes much of the success to these "things that live off the business plan that make the biggest difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Zico Coconut Water:** His experience running a 100-mile race led him to discover the hydration benefits of coconut water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Recognizing its potential as a "new Gatorade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a> in a non-existent market, he again leveraged his network to secure a meeting with Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.
    *   **Making it Memorable:** During a struggling pitch to Coca-Cola, he impulsively mentioned his "partner Matt Damon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. He then convinced Damon to film a 35-second video highlighting the need for better access to coconut water, which helped seal the deal for a partnership with Zico and ultimately led to Coca-Cola's acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. This illustrates the art of [[creating_and_leveraging_luck_through_content_and_networking | creating and leveraging luck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

## Understanding Wealth and Opportunity
Itzler openly discussed his initial struggles with [[understanding_wealth_and_opportunity | managing wealth]] after his first exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, attributing it to a lack of "relationship with money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. He overspent, believing success would be "pretty easy" to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

*   He learned that "more isn't better, better is better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   He now declines opportunities that promise "high aggravation for high reward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, prioritizing family, health, and friends over solely financial pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   He advocates for not doing a "good idea" if it doesn't align with one's desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>, citing his decision not to pursue an idea to make commercial travel feel like private travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

## Life Rules for Seizing Experiences
Beyond business, Itzler applies a similar intentionality to life:

*   **Three-Minute Rule:** He dedicates three minutes a day to connect with people, sending texts or making calls to compliment, congratulate, or console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. This simple act builds and maintains "authentic relationships" and creates "permission slips" for future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.
*   **Musogi:** Inspired by a Japanese ritual, he aims to do one "year-defining thing" annually, such as a cross-America bike ride or living with a Navy SEAL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This builds a "life resume" of significant achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.
*   **Kevin's Rule:** Every other weekend, he does something he normally wouldn't, like camping in the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>. This creates "mini-adventures" that accumulate over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

Itzler believes that the feeling derived from selling a business is the same as finishing a marathon or helping an old lady across the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. He emphasizes that one doesn't need to "grind and chase something" for decades to achieve that feeling, as it can be found daily through intentional actions and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. His [[lessons_from_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial journey]] and [[finding_and_pursuing_personal_purpose | personal purpose]] are deeply intertwined with this philosophy of aggressively seeking and making the most of every opportunity, whether in business or life.

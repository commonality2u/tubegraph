Microconf is an event series founded by Rob Walling, designed to support independent software founders. It stands out in a landscape filled with online communities by successfully operating well-executed in-person events, which Walling considers an "incredible competitive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Founder's Background and Microconf's Genesis
Rob Walling describes himself as a former software developer turned serial entrepreneur who bootstrapped his businesses without raising funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. He advocates against the narrative that startups *must* raise funding, believing that only about one percent of tech companies truly need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

Walling founded Microconf in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Prior to that, he had launched several software companies, including Drip, an email service provider, which he grew to a few million dollars in annual recurring revenue (ARR) before selling it in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. After leaving Drip, Walling considered selling his entire entrepreneurial platform—including his [[Improving Business Presentations and Communication | podcast]] and [[Running inperson events effectively | MicroConf]]—and even explored acquiring a [[Unexpected Business Ventures and Case Studies | tabletop gaming website]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. However, realizing the tabletop gaming business made "no money" compared to software, he decided to "double down" on his existing ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

## The Events Business Model
Initially, Walling didn't view Microconf as primarily an events business, despite running events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. He considered it more as a [[The influence of business education and networking | community]] builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

### Challenges and Growth
*   **Early Struggles:** In 2011, Microconf aimed to sell 200 tickets at $800 or $500 each, but only sold about 70, which was "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
*   **Sponsorships:** It took two to three years to build trust with sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. Sponsors often book a year in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.
*   **Expansion:** While running Drip, Microconf held three major events annually, generating around half a million to $600,000 in top-line revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. Currently, Microconf plans to hold 15 events in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Profit:** Microconf anticipates low seven-figure revenue, possibly $1 million to $1.5 million in top line for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. The profit margin is around 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>, as the organization chooses not to maximize profit but instead operates many local events at break-even or a loss to expand its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Mission:** Microconf's core mission is to increase the number of independent startups in the world, specifically "bootstrap startups" or those raising small amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of In-Person Events
> There are numerous online communities, but very few individuals or organizations [[Running inperson events effectively | run in person events]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Doing so offers an "incredible competitive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. In-person meetings foster a tightly-knit [[The influence of business education and networking | community]], with a 60-70% retention rate for attendees, leading to a network where everyone knows each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Investing in Startups
Walling also runs Tiny Seed, a startup accelerator for bootstrapped SaaS founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Tiny Seed funds LLCs and allows founders to take profits, with Tiny Seed receiving a pro-rata share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### Examples of Unexpectedly Successful SaaS Companies:
Walling has observed many SaaS companies through Tiny Seed's application process (2,000-3,000 applicants across four batches) that have surprised him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Builder Prime:** A CRM specifically for home improvement contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. It addresses communication issues beyond general project management tools like Basecamp by providing a "strongly typed version" built for their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. Companies in Tiny Seed's Batch 2 are expected to be in the mid-six to seven figures in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. This aligns with the idea of creating niche-specific software rather than a broad solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Scraping Bee:** Publicly discloses revenue and crossed $1 million ARR recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. It allows users to scrape the web, handling server and blocking issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. Started at $4,000/month two years ago and now earns around $90,000-$100,000/month with only two founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

### Platform Risk
Building a SaaS company on an existing platform (like Shopify, Salesforce, or Hubspot) introduces platform risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Walling experienced an angel investment where Shopify started demanding a large portion of revenue from an app that was doing well, effectively threatening to shut it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. Such companies typically sell for a lower multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

### Ideas for Opportunities
Walling believes that any time someone is using Excel/Google Sheets, or engaging in extensive email/text communication for a task, it's a potential SaaS idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

*   **Bundling Podcast Production Tools:** Similar to how Hubspot bundled various marketing tools, there's an opportunity to create an all-in-one platform for podcast production, moving beyond disparate tools for recording, editing, and hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
    *   **Podcast Software Market:** While many podcasts are hobbyist and low-revenue, there are two higher tiers: SMBs (like "My First Million" or "Startups for the Rest of Us") willing to pay $100+ per month for reliable services and less likely to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>, and large enterprises (like iHeartRadio, ESPN) that need robust solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. Some high-end features can cost thousands per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
    *   **Dual Funnel:** Podcasting (like e-signature services) benefits from a "dual funnel" strategy: a wide base of free/inexpensive users (building brand and virality) and a top tier of high-paying enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **"Examine.com for Web3/Crypto":** A trusted, unbiased source of information for crypto and NFTs, similar to how Examine.com provides reliable nutrition information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. This business could last for decades, like Consumer Reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Building credibility through a podcast and attending crypto events to [[Networking and meeting influential people | get into the network]] would be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
*   **Niche-Specific CRM/Project Management:** Taking a common concept like CRM or project management and tailoring it for a specific niche continues to be a viable strategy. Examples include Client Hub (project management for accountants) and Gymdesk (running a gym business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. These can range from lifestyle businesses (thousands per month) to multi-million dollar enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

## Building a SaaS Company as a Non-Technical Founder
Approximately 20-25% of bootstrapped SaaS companies have no technical founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>. These founders typically excel as subject matter experts (e.g., an accountant building software for accountants), or in sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

### Approaches for Non-Technical Founders:
*   **Acquisition:** Acquire an existing product, then grow it using content marketing expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Hiring:** Hire a developer or an agency to build the product. Referrals within communities are a good way to find trusted developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Services like Trustshoring (Eastern European dev agencies) and CloudDevs.com (Latin America) act as brokers to vetted agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. An MVP for a SaaS app typically costs $10,000-$30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping/Pre-selling:** Non-technical founders often work a [[Balancing personal life and business | day job]] to funnel money into development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>. They can also build a minimum viable product (MVP) using no-code tools like Zapier and Notion to prove the concept and generate early revenue, which can then fund development or justify raising funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Productized Services:** Start a productized service in a specific niche (e.g., podcast editing), gain revenue and expertise, and then reinvest profits into building a software product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. This was the approach of Castos's single founder, who started with podcast editing and later acquired a WordPress podcast plugin, turning it into a seven-figure business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

> [!tip] Stair-Step Approach to Bootstrapping
> For non-technical founders, Walling recommends starting small with something like a WordPress plugin, a Hubspot add-on, or a Salesforce add-on. This approach is less expensive, easier to maintain, and allows founders to gain experience and generate enough revenue to eventually leave their day job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

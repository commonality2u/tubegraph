[[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | Generative AI]], particularly large language models like ChatGPT, has introduced a new and critical skill set: prompt engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This emerging discipline is analogous to traditional software engineering, but instead of coding, it involves communicating with AI to achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) for AI models to guide them toward generating specific, useful, and high-quality outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. It's about speaking to a large language model to get it to produce the desired content or action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

For example, a user was able to create a website by simply asking ChatGPT: "tell me how to make a simple website that says hello world in the middle of the page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. When faced with a technical issue, like a grayed-out upload button on Netlify, the AI was able to troubleshoot and explain that it was looking for a folder, not a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This ability to converse and troubleshoot iteratively highlights the importance of effective prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Comparison to Software Engineering

The analogy to software engineering is direct:
*   **Software Engineering** is about getting a computer to do what you want by speaking to it in its language (code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering** is about getting a large language model to produce what you want by communicating effectively in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Both fields require understanding the underlying system and precisely conveying instructions to achieve a specific result.

## Opportunity for Non-Software Engineers

This new skill creates significant opportunities for individuals who are not traditional software engineers but possess other valuable abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This includes:
*   **Good Writers:** Those who can articulate ideas clearly and concisely.
*   **Analysts:** Individuals adept at describing problems and desired outcomes.
*   **Critical Thinkers:** People who can break down complex tasks into understandable steps or desired results for the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that prompt engineering is poised to become a "big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## Investment in the Future

The perceived significance of prompt engineering is so high that one individual invested a seven-figure sum to acquire the domain name prompt.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This acquisition, though without immediate public plans, signals a strong conviction in the future importance of this skill and the underlying [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | chat-based user experience (Chat UX)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, which Bill Gates has also highlighted as the next major paradigm shift in computing after the graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

As [[impact_of_ai_and_future_trends | AI and its impact on various industries]] continues to expand, the ability to effectively communicate with and direct these intelligent systems through prompt engineering will be a crucial differentiator for [[utilizing_ai_in_daily_business_operations | individuals and businesses leveraging AI tools]].

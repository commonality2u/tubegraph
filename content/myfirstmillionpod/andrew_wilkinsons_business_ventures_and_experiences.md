[[Andrew Wilkinsons journey from 20000 to 260000000 | Andrew Wilkinson]], known for his investment firm Tiny, has a wide range of business experiences, from successful acquisitions and public offerings to challenging ventures and outright failures. His journey highlights lessons in identifying viable business models, operational challenges, and investment strategies.

## Early Entrepreneurial Approach
Early in his career, Andrew Wilkinson adopted a "throwing spaghetti against the wall" approach, constantly starting new businesses, sometimes as frequently as every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This allowed him to learn what constitutes a good business model through direct experience and "constant pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. He also gained insights from running an agency, observing the mistakes other startups made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This period of intense experimentation, marked by several painful failures, led him to swear off starting new businesses for a time, only returning to it in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Business Difficulty Scale
Wilkinson categorizes businesses based on their inherent difficulty:
*   **Hardest Businesses**: These typically involve "brick and mortar" operations, moving physical goods, and managing a large number of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. An example he owns is a bakery and deli with 40-50 employees, requiring constant coordination and susceptible to disruptions like employee sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Medium Difficulty**: Agencies fall into this category. They are "asset light" and scalable, only requiring an office and internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. However, they are challenging due to the constant balancing of supply and demand, requiring readiness for radical changes during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Easiest Businesses**: Often, these are online ventures that don't involve physical goods or extensive employee management.

## Key Ventures and Experiences

### Successful Ventures
*   **Pixel Union (now WeCommerce)**: Started as a side project making Tumblr themes for David Karp, founder of Tumblr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. It began generating "automatic revenue," bringing in $10,000 a month initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Shopify later approached them to create themes for their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Wilkinson spun it out of MetaLab, sold it for $7 million in 2014, a decision he later regretted due to the business's high growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Years later, he bought it back for $26 million and eventually took it public as WeCommerce at a $260 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **WeWorkRemotely**: Acquired from Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of Basecamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This remote job board became a "very large business" with a "very small team" due to simple best practices and excellent SEO that ranked for "remote jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Wilkinson considers it the easiest business he owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Aeropress**: A notable acquisition, this coffee snob product was unique for its brand recognition and lasting impact potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Despite not being a pure internet business, Wilkinson aims to enhance its online presence. The original inventor was a "wacky scientist inventor" type, not a business guy, and the previous focus was heavily on retail channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Tiny hired the former president of SodaStream US to lead Aeropress as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Mezcal (Mealime)**: A fitness and meal-planning app that Wilkinson acquired and later sold to Albertsons for "tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The founder, Mitch, was largely left alone to grow the business, demonstrating Wilkinson's preference for holding rather than selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Challenging Ventures
*   **H.J. Muse (Cat Furniture E-commerce)**: Wilkinson invested $300,000 into an online store for "hideous" cat furniture, learning firsthand the brutal reality of e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The business had "razor-thin margins" (2-3% EBITDA compared to 30-50% in agencies) and required constant reinvestment of profits into inventory, leading to its closure and the loss of the initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Famous Original (Pizzeria)**: As a designer, Wilkinson "fetishized the idea of having brick and mortar businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He and friends started a bar and pizzeria, only to discover that restaurants are "brutal," suffering from poor management, wrong incentives, overspending on build-out, and labor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Flow (Project Management Software)**: Wilkinson invested $10 million into this SaaS business, attempting to compete with Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He realized the futility of "fighting an army that has unlimited budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, resulting in a significant loss.

## Investment Philosophy and Lessons
Wilkinson's [[Investment strategies and reflections by Andrew Wilkinson | investment philosophy]] has evolved significantly. After selling Pixel Union, he had a "pile of cash" and started reading extensively about [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and early entrepreneurial experiences | Warren Buffett]] and value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. He transformed from knowing "nothing about any of this" eight years prior to becoming a top percentile investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that being a better investor is due to his experience as a businessman, allowing him to view companies through an "operational lens" rather than just a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. He criticizes "spreadsheet investors" who fail to understand the human element required to implement changes within a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

Wilkinson generally prefers to "buy and hold" businesses forever, believing it's often better than selling, especially when a business is declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### New Venture: Tenzing
Driven by his own past experiences of not understanding finance or how to access capital, Wilkinson launched Tenzing, a "modern Investment Bank for Founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Named after Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa who helped Edmund Hillary climb Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, the firm aims to guide bootstrapped founders through options like raising debt, doing secondaries, or selling their businesses in an "aligned and not fee driven" way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. He believes this service is crucial for founders who don't know how to navigate the financial world, much like how he missed out on R&D tax credits and credit lines for his own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Critique of Venture Capital
Wilkinson is critical of the traditional venture capital model, particularly the "rigged game" aspect where firms make substantial management fees regardless of investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He notes that large VC firms can earn tens of millions annually in fees, often with minimal operational costs, allowing them to profit even if their investments underperform over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. His own funds, in contrast, operate with zero management fees, aligning incentives with actual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

He highlights that even "smart money" can make "dumb bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of independent conviction, warning against blindly following big names in investing, as they might have unfair advantages or bet on fundamentally flawed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. He cites examples like the high-profile failures in crypto (e.g., FTX investments by Paradigm) and SPACs (e.g., Chamath Palihapitiya's MetroMile) where large sums were invested into ultimately failing ventures, yet the promoters and early investors often cashed out before the collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

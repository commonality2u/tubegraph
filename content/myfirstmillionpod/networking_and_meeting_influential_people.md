Andrew Wilkinson is described as a master networker, skilled at building valuable connections and finding opportunities to engage with interesting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. His approach to [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | networking]] is not merely about meeting people but about fostering meaningful interactions and creating excuses to collaborate or spend time together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

## Strategies for Connection

Andrew employs several strategies to meet influential people and build his network:

### Shooting Your Shot
One method is to directly reach out to individuals he admires or finds interesting, often through cold emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.

*   **Dan Gilbert:** In 2016, Andrew cold-emailed Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quick Loans/Rocket Mortgage, after reading about his efforts to rebuild Detroit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Andrew's email highlighted shared interests like owning a bakery, passion for his city, and bootstrapping his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. He offered to meet "anytime, anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, and received a positive response within 20 minutes, leading to a meeting in Detroit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Bill Ackman:** Andrew also sought to connect with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Initially, he emailed Ackman, offering the services of his design agency to redesign Chipotle's website (a company Ackman had invested in) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. While Ackman forwarded the email to a board member, it established a direct line of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Later, Andrew bid $57,000 at a charity auction to have lunch with Ackman in 2017, leading to a connection and a future business investment from Ackman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

### Leveraging Connections and Unique Communication
Building on existing relationships or using unconventional means can also be effective.

*   **Charlie Munger:** Andrew met Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, through a mutual friend, Andrew Marx, who organized a dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Recognizing Munger's preference for written communication, Andrew and his colleague Chris began writing letters to Munger, who would then call them back verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. This established a unique and memorable connection.

### Demonstrating Value and Willingness to Invest
Key principles for Andrew's networking success include:

*   **Being of Value:** He believes in providing value to others and being open to meeting interesting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Investing Time and Resources:** Andrew is willing to invest money and time, such as flying to meet someone, purchasing charity auction items, or participating in programs that matter to influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. This demonstrates commitment and seriousness. For instance, he sent a private jet to pick up Sam from the podcast for a meeting to discuss a potential business acquisition, which left a strong impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## The Importance of "Earning the Room"

While strategic investment in networking is valuable, Andrew emphasizes the concept of "earning the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. He cautions against buying one's way into exclusive circles where one doesn't genuinely belong or have shared value.

*   **TED Global:** Andrew successfully "earned the room" at TED Global. He started by attending a junior event, then pitched Chris Anderson (who ran TED) on designing a TED app. This project earned him access to the main event, where he connected with interesting people who saw his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Vanity Fair Oscars Afterparty:** In contrast, attending the Vanity Fair Oscars Afterparty, arranged through a service called Myria that helps convert money into interesting life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, felt different. Despite the surreal experience of being surrounded by A-list celebrities, Andrew realized he lacked shared language or value in that specific entertainment industry context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. People would "glaze over" when he mentioned he was in tech, rather than film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. He concluded that it's not enjoyable to be in a room where you don't genuinely have value to offer or feel like you belong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Ironically, after this experience, his company later acquired Letterboxd, a large social network for film buffs, which would now give him relevant standing in such a gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

Andrewâ€™s experiences highlight the importance of humility and willingness to "shoot your shot," coupled with strategic investment and a keen understanding of when and where one can truly contribute value. His approach underscores the idea that [[creating_and_leveraging_luck_through_content_and_networking | networking]] is an ongoing process of seeking genuine connection and earning one's place.

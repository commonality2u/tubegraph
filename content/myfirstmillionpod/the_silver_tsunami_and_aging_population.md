The "silver tsunami" refers to the phenomenon of humans living significantly longer than previously expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This trend is overlooked despite its profound impact on various societal aspects, including pensions, housing (e.g., nursing homes), healthcare, and the support systems required for an older population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Historical Context and Longevity Trends

Over the last several decades, average human lifespan has increased by two to three years per decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Data from "Our World in Data" shows a fundamental shift in life expectancy around 1900, leading to people living much longer than their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

A stark example of this change is the shift in the most common age of death:
*   In the UK in 1965, the most common age of death was the first year of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Today, the most common age to die is 87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Cohort data further illustrates this trend:
*   A newborn girl in Japan as of 2020 has a 99.6% chance of living to age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   The chance of living to age 40 is 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   The chance of making it to age 60 is 96% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

This extended lifespan fundamentally changes personal and societal calculations, especially concerning [[understanding_and_managing_economic_security | financial planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. While the average American might expect to retire at 65 and live to 75, a longer lifespan means needing to save for 30 years of retirement, impacting [[understanding_and_managing_economic_security | economics]] and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The US is falling behind some G7 nations in longevity, primarily due to "diseases of despair" such as alcoholism and drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, if these factors are removed, Americans live just as long as those in comparable nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Healthcare spending in the US is substantial, representing about 20% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. For example, 8% of the US budget is spent on kidney dialysis, which is three times the budget of NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Medicare alone spends over $50 billion annually on dialysis and related treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | Business Opportunities in Longevity and Healthcare]]

The aging population creates numerous [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business opportunities]] and challenges across various sectors.

### [[menopause_and_overlooked_business_spaces | Menopause and Overlooked Business Spaces]]

Menopause, where women's ovaries stop functioning, is a significant and often overlooked area for [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. It impacts anyone with ovaries and involves a "super super accelerated aging period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Around the age of 50-60 (sometimes earlier), women experience hormonal changes that lead to approximately 34 symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Before age 55, cardiovascular illness is a more likely cause of mortality in men, but after 55, this reverses due to menopause's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   6,000 women in the US enter menopause every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Despite its widespread impact, there are fewer female entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs over 50 starting companies to address this space, making it "completely overlooked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Companies like Bonafide and Gennev have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   The success of apps like Flo (a period tracking app with over 380 million users), which addresses earlier stages of female reproductive health, highlights the potential for similar large-scale solutions for menopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Healthcare and Assisted Living

The aging population drives significant demand for healthcare services and facilities.
*   The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts nursing will be the fastest-growing occupation between 2020 and 2030, adding 275,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   In Japan, which has experienced the "silver tsunami" earlier due to a declining birth rate, the number of nursing homes has risen nearly 50% over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Japan also offers free or cheap "akiyas" (vacant houses) in some cases, due to older populations passing away and social stigmas associated with certain neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Assisted living facilities are a growing market:
*   From 2004 to 2021, the median annual price of assisted living increased 31% faster than inflation, reaching $54,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   There are 31,000 assisted living facilities in the US, with four out of five operating as for-profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   Half of all operators clear annual returns of 20% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   Despite profitability, many existing options are perceived as low quality, presenting an opportunity for "premium" assisted living facilities that offer better care, potentially at a higher price point for the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   There's a lack of technology-based startups in this space because entrepreneurs often haven't experienced the problems faced by the elderly, making it an "unsexy space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

### Longevity and Health Monitoring

A significant area for [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business development]] lies in tools and services that help people monitor and improve their health, especially as they age.
*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs):** Dexcom's Stelo is the first over-the-counter FDA-approved CGM, making this technology more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. CGMs measure blood glucose levels, offering immediate feedback on how food and lifestyle choices impact health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. High blood glucose can damage organs and lead to insulin resistance, contributing to conditions like type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
    *   The direct, reactive nature of CGM data can be a powerful motivator for health changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
    *   This accessibility creates potential for new businesses, such as a "Strava for CGMs" to socialize and gamify health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   The "Glucose Goddess," an educator on glucose, has gained millions of followers and launched products like "Anti-Spike," showing public interest in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
    *   A business model could use CGMs as a loss leader (e.g., offering them for free) to gather metabolic health data and then upsell to services like health concierges, nutrition education, personal trainers, or gym referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   An example of a challenge-based business built on CGM data is "wearablechallenge.com," which involved participants paying a fee to maintain glucose levels below a threshold and earning money back for successful days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

### Posture and Physical Health

Awareness of personal health can lead to unexpected discoveries, like high cholesterol in a seemingly healthy individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This highlights that physical appearance (e.g., being skinny) does not guarantee health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Continuous monitoring and data (like blood work or CGMs) reveal true health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

Posture, specifically "nerdneck" or forward head posture common from prolonged computer use, is another area of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Solutions like the "Better Back" strap (which pulls knees and back to encourage straighter sitting) and the "Form" sports bra are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Proper posture is primarily a function of core and back muscle strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. Resources like Brian Johnson's posture exercises or the Egoscue Method can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

### Future Trends in Physical Activity

The market for sports and fitness is evolving, creating new categories for [[future_trends_in_technology_and_business_development | business development]]:
*   **Accessible Sports:** Pickleball exemplifies taking an existing sport (like tennis) and making it more accessible by modifying equipment (ball bounciness, paddle feel) and court size, enabling broader participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
*   **Challenging/Elite Sports:** Teqball, a mix of soccer and ping-pong, offers a more difficult and visually impressive experience, attracting highly agile competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Padel, a tennis-like sport played with walls, is also gaining popularity as a more challenging option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Hybrid/Accessible Challenges:** Everesting involves repeatedly running or cycling up and down any hill to accumulate the equivalent elevation gain of Mount Everest, offering an achievable challenge without specialized equipment or location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The "29029" event is a more high-end version that involves repeatedly climbing a mountain for 36 hours straight until the elevation of Everest is achieved, with glamping accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. These "go hard" events cater to a competitive segment and create new forms of shared experiences.

## Societal Implications

Despite increased longevity, life can feel short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. The rapid growth of children emphasizes how quickly time passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. The concept of living to 120 or 130 years old, while currently rare (the oldest human lived to 122 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>), is predicted to become more common for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. It's currently more likely to be a billionaire (around 3,000 globally) than to live past 110 (around 800-1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

Interestingly, happiness tends to follow a "smile curve" throughout life: people are generally happy early in life, experience a dip in mid-life, and then become increasingly happy as they get older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. This could be interpreted as a shift in priorities, where mid-life focuses on external validation and career climbing, while later life brings a realization of what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

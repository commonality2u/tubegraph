## Entertainment and Influencer Space

The entertainment industry is exploring how AI can extend the reach and monetization of public figures:

### Influencer AI Voice Clones
Snapchat influencer Karen Marjorie partnered with an [[AI business ideas | AI company]] to create an AI version of her voice [00:48:30].

*   **Cameo through AI:** The idea of a service like Cameo, but powered by [[AI and its impact on various industries | AI]], is gaining traction [00:50:20].

Users can pay to receive advice or answers from an [[ai_business_ideas | AI version]] of an expert, replicated in their voice and style, without the expert needing to spend time [00:54:02].
*   **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** A key question arises regarding the need for permission from individuals to create and monetize their [[AI clones and digital doubles in the business and entertainment space | AI doubles]] [00:54:35].

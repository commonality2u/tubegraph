MrBeast, also known as Jimmy, founded Feastables, a chocolate company, with a mission to address unethical practices in the chocolate industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. His decision to enter the chocolate business stemmed from a significant ethical concern regarding cocoa sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## The Problem of Child Labor in Cocoa Production

Approximately 70% of the world's cocoa originates from West Africa, specifically CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Ghana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. A substantial portion of the labor in these cocoa farms, 46%, involves illegal child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. When confronted about this issue, representatives from large chocolate companies typically dismiss it, claiming, "that's the way things have always been" and that "there's not really anything you can do about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This response greatly angered MrBeast, who found it unacceptable that such a problem could not be solved when advancements like putting people on Mars are being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

The root cause of child labor is primarily poverty, as most cocoa farmers earn less than a dollar a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. Due to their meager income, farmers cannot afford to hire adult workers and resort to using children because they are cheap or free labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

## Feastables' Approach to Ethical Sourcing

To address these issues, Feastables employs several strategies for ethical sourcing:

### Consultation and Learning
MrBeast applied his "consultants are cheat codes" mindset to understand ethical chocolate production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. He contacted Tony's Chocolonely, a European brand known for its ethical practices, and flew their representatives to Greenville to learn about remediating child labor and responsible farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. He also studied the practices of five other ethical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. This diligent [[researching_companies_and_market_demand | research]] helped him formulate Feastables' strategy.

### Living Income for Farmers
A core tenet of Feastables' ethical sourcing is ensuring that 100% of its farmers are paid a living income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. This "living income reference price" is calculated based on local living costs, including factors like bread prices and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This means if a farmer needs to make $1,300 for a metric ton of cocoa to achieve a living income, Feastables will pay that amount, even if the farmer requests less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This direct approach aims to eliminate the economic incentive for child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

### Certifications and Audits
All of Feastables' cocoa beans are Fair Trade certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. The company also partners with the Child Labor Remediation System (CLRMS), which routinely audits farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. These audits involve interviewing parents and children to ensure kids are attending school and not engaged in illegal child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Identified cases of child labor are followed up to ensure the children are removed from the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### Farmer Support and Efficiency
To further combat poverty and improve farmers' livelihoods, Feastables provides coaches to represent approximately 200 farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. These coaches educate farmers on how to increase yield and grow more trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Simple tools, like wheelbarrows, are also provided to improve efficiency and reduce the physical burden of labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.

## Ambition for the Future
MrBeast's long-term goal is to make Feastables the largest ethically sourced chocolate company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. By demonstrating that it's possible to be both profitable and ethical on a large scale, he aims to challenge larger chocolate corporations that rely on unethical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. He believes this will serve as a model, proving that there is "no excuse" for their current practices beyond a lack of care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. This ambition reflects a broader commitment to [[philanthropy_and_social_responsibility | social responsibility]].

> [!note] Reinvest Everything
> MrBeast is known for his commitment to reinvesting nearly all profits back into his ventures. He explicitly states that he doesn't care about keeping money personally; his primary focus is to make the "best product possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This [[financial_transparency_in_business | financial transparency]] and dedication to reinvestment apply to Feastables as well, allowing for significant investment in ethical sourcing practices that might otherwise be deemed too costly by traditional businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

A key takeaway for [[getting_rich_through_different_business_models | building successful businesses]] is to "sell to the rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The ultra-wealthy and institutions like hedge funds and private equity firms represent a "starving crowd" or a market with urgent needs and high willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Characteristics of Wealthy Clients
Wealthy clients, such as private equity firms and hedge funds, exhibit several key characteristics:
*   **Not Price Sensitive** They are not price sensitive at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Urgent Needs** Their needs are urgent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Rational Decision-Makers** They are "super rational," meaning they will pay significantly for a solution that helps them make a much larger decision or gain a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. For example, $100,000 for something that helps make a $10 million decision is seen as good math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Seeking Certainty (CYA)** A significant reason consultants are hired is to provide certainty and cover for decisions. This "CYA" component ensures that if a deal goes wrong, the mid-level partner can show they did their due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

## Identifying and Meeting Their Needs
Jesse, a successful entrepreneur, outlines a strategy for [[building_and_selling_successful_businesses | building and selling successful businesses]] by serving this market:
1.  **Find the Starving Crowd** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>: Instead of starting with a "cool idea," identify a market with a clear, urgent problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  **Leverage Existing Network** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>: Jesse's career in finance and consulting, combined with connections from attending Penn, provided an "unfair advantage" in understanding the needs of private equity and hedge fund professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
3.  **Utilize Expert Networks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>: Platforms like GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group) allow individuals to register as experts and get paid for calls with Wall Street professionals seeking insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This provides a direct channel to understand what the wealthy need.
4.  **Start with Information Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>: Initially, Jesse's company, Ampsh, bootstrapped by selling 50-page research reports on the lead generation industry for $5,000 each, raising $150,000 from hedge fund clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
5.  **Listen to Direct Inquiries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>: Repeated calls from friends at private equity firms asking for help with digital marketing due diligence eventually led to the creation of Aux Insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Aux Insights: Marketing Due Diligence & Value Creation
Aux Insights is a private equity consulting business specializing in marketing-related diligence for prospective acquisitions and "value creation" strategies post-acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>: They assess the digital marketing performance (Google/Facebook ads, web traffic) of target companies, identify red flags, and provide analysis to investment committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Value Creation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>: After a business is acquired, they help develop strategies to grow the business by optimizing marketing levers and translating them into revenue and EBITDA terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Pricing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>: Aux Insights charges $50,000 per week for a team of consultants, positioning themselves as 75% cheaper than traditional firms like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG, while being more specialized in online marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>: In 25% of projects, Aux Insights has advised clients to avoid deals due to hidden issues like SEO backlinking problems or unreasonable management projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This saves clients significantly more money than the consulting fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

### Information and Data
The ultra-wealthy and financial institutions pay exorbitant amounts for specialized information and data.
*   **Bloomberg Terminal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>: A Bloomberg Terminal costs $1,200 a month per user, with no price negotiation or volume discounts, demonstrating the high value placed on real-time financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **First Rain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>: A service that provides stock ticker alerts for news, essentially a paid version of "Google Alerts," cost Goldman Sachs $50,000 per month for a group license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. The rationale is that one trade ahead of competitors justifies the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Data Feeds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>: Jesse provided a hedge fund friend with a real-time aggregate data feed of Ampsh's Facebook ad performance (CPM, CTR, etc.) in exchange for a $5 million interest-free loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Proposed Data Product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>: Jesse proposes a business selling aggregated digital ad spend data (Meta, Google, Amazon) to hedge funds for $50,000 per quarter with a two-year subscription minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Limiting access to only a few buyers (e.g., 20) and using a reverse auction model could drive up prices, as exclusivity is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## The "Add a Zero" Principle
When considering [[getting_rich_through_different_business_models | business models]], it's beneficial to "add a zero" to the end of the dollar amount you can charge for the same work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   Events that charge $300 a ticket versus $3,000 or even $30,000 for similar content demonstrate this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   This approach contrasts with targeting "broke people," which requires many customers to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Red Ventures: A Case Study in Scaling by Serving Large Clients
Red Ventures, a multi-billion dollar company, provides a master class in scaling by selling to high-LTV (long-term value) industries.
*   **Early Model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>: They started as an authorized dealer for DirectTV, acquiring customers through online media (Google AdWords, SEO) and phone calls, earning $500 per customer, leading to a $75 million EBITDA business in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Expansion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>: They applied this model to other high-LTV purchases like credit cards (American Express), Verizon Wireless, and pest control, managing marketing for these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Strategy (Rollups)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>: Red Ventures scaled by acquiring and rolling up SEO content businesses, applying four key levers to increase value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
    1.  **Traffic Acquisition Improvement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>: Optimizing both paid and organic traffic, focusing on cost per visitor and revenue per visitor, and significantly increasing visitor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    2.  **On-site Optimization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>: Improving the website's conversion rates to turn visitors into customers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
    3.  **Pricing Genius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>: Determining the exact willingness to pay for incremental customers and charging more, significantly increasing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. An example involves an executive discarding an algorithm to personally call customers and charge them their maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 20% EBITDA increase in the first month post-acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
    4.  **Lean Staffing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>: Thoughtfully challenging organizational bloat and reducing headcount while maintaining or growing revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. An extreme example involved a "draft" to select the top 40 out of 80 employees in an acquired business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Culture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>: Red Ventures is known for its unique culture, described as "part Wall Street trading desk, part Southern politeness, and part hardnose direct response marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. Their meetings are short, bottom-line focused, numbers-driven, and teams are organized by KPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

## Understanding Private Equity and Rollups
For profitable founders with businesses doing $2-5 million in EBITDA, understanding private equity (PE) and rollups is a significant [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | value creation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Multiple Arbitrage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>: PE firms can buy smaller businesses (e.g., $1-2 million EBITDA) at lower multiples (4-5x EBITDA) and then combine them into a larger entity. This larger entity, due to increased growth, stability, and margin, can be sold at a significantly higher multiple (e.g., 15x EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Founder Participation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>: Founders can roll a portion of their equity into the new combined entity, taking some cash off the table initially and getting a second, larger payout when the rolled-up business is sold at a higher valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   This approach offers a clear path to [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | wealth creation]] that can be more predictable and less risky than venture capital paths for many founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

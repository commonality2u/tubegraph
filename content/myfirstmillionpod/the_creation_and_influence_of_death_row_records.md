Death Row Records, an influential music label, was co-founded by Michael "[[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Harry O]]" Harris while he was incarcerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Despite his imprisonment, Harris felt a strong desire to continue working and having an impact, unwilling for his sentence to be the end of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. He channeled his entrepreneurial energy into creating the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

## Background

Before his incarceration, Harris was already involved in various aspects of the entertainment business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. He owned multiple businesses, including a limousine service, construction company, [[independent_music_production_and_marketing_strategies | production companies]], music companies, beauty salons, and real estate investment companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. By age 23, his limousine business alone had about 30 luxury vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. He also produced concerts and plays, and supported clubs in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Harris's journey into the music industry began when he opened a studio called The Jingle Factory, creating commercials for local radio stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This brought him into contact with musicians, producers, and singers, leading him to manage groups and work with record labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He also created his own [[independent_music_production_and_marketing_strategies | production company]], "Why Not Production," to help artists who lacked financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This led to his involvement in [[involvement_in_broadway_and_the_entertainment_industry | Broadway shows]], such as "Checkmate," which he took to various cities and ultimately to [[involvement_in_broadway_and_the_entertainment_industry | Broadway]] with Anita Landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. However, his life "came crashing down" when he was arrested for attempted murder and drug conspiracy just before the play's full-scale launch on [[involvement_in_broadway_and_the_entertainment_industry | Broadway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Founding Death Row Records

The concept for Death Row Records emerged from the discontent of Dr. Dre with Ruthless Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Dr. Dre, who was the primary producer for N.W.A., felt his value was overlooked by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This opened an opportunity for Suge Knight, who began managing Dr. Dre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. [[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Michael Harris]] was introduced to Suge Knight shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

Initially, Harris and Knight created "Godfather Entertainment," from which Death Row Records later emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. Harris, having been briefly housed on death row in San Quentin, was profoundly affected by witnessing young people sentenced to death there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. This experience inspired him to choose the name "Death Row" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. His attorney at the time, David Kenner, was also part of the partnership that helped establish the company while Harris was incarcerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. His ex-wife, Lydia, was also part of the management team that facilitated the company's early operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

## Early Success and Key Artists

Death Row Records, though not having a large roster, had an incredibly effective one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. The moment the world heard Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's voices together, it was a "game changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Warren G, a member of a group with Snoop Dogg, facilitated Snoop's entry into the fold due to his relationship with Dr. Dre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

Notable albums released quickly by Death Row Records include:
*   **The Chronic** (Dr. Dre) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a> – sold around three million units rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.
*   **Doggystyle** (Snoop Dogg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a> – sold nearly seven million units quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
*   **All Eyez on Me** (Tupac Shakur) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

Other artists on the label included female artists like Rage and the Dog Pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. Tupac joined later but brought significant "fire," solidifying Death Row's place in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

The label's initial financial model for cassette sales (around $9.00-$10.00 each) allowed Death Row to receive about 30-40% of the revenue, or $3-$4 per tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. For Harris, witnessing such significant revenue from a legitimate venture was important, proving that success could be achieved legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

## Influence and Legacy

Death Row Records transformed the music industry by transitioning from an independent setting to becoming a major player in the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. The label's success significantly increased the distribution capabilities of companies like Universal due to their relationship with Death Row and Interscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Conversely, Warner Brothers almost exited the music business due to their mishandling of their relationship with Death Row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

Death Row provided a platform for artists to speak about the realities of their communities, often referred to as "reality rap" or "gangster rap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. This music shed light on issues like police brutality and injustice, serving as a "profitable vehicle" for communication that wouldn't normally have access to such a wide audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

The energy and sound of Death Row's music were "infectious," allowing people from various cultures to relate to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>. It provided an empowering energy, akin to how startups create something out of nothing, which resonated with audiences globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Management Style

Managing creative individuals, especially those with a "wild side" or who found themselves in challenging situations, was a significant undertaking for Death Row's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. Harris believes it's essential to "take people where they are" and recognize that their backgrounds influenced their art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. He highlights that many of these artists, who might have exhibited problematic behavior early on, later became philanthropists, created charities and foundations, and mentored others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.

Harris acknowledges that Death Row's story, with its blend of wealth, lost lives, and ruined careers, resembles a "Shakespearean play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. He views Suge Knight as a creative individual who, in the beginning, had the potential to be a major entrepreneur due to his ability to connect the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. However, Knight's "implosion" and "unraveling" from the opportunities around him became a tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Current Status and Future

Death Row Records, which had seen its prominence decline, is now "back" and strong, being viewed differently by a new generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. Snoop Dogg has acquired Death Row with partners, and [[life_and_career_of_death_row_records_cofounder_harryo | Michael Harris]] serves as the CEO of the new iteration of the label he helped create decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. While the most impactful part of his career so far, Harris emphasizes his career is not over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, with new film projects and initiatives in the works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. He plans to launch his own [[building_a_successful_media_empire_through_podcasting | podcast]] to further share insights and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

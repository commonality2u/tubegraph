The "Learn Earn Legacy" framework proposes that a career naturally progresses through three distinct phases: Learn, Earn, and Legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. This framework suggests a natural evolution for a successful career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## The Learn Phase

The beginning of one's career is generally the "Learn" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>. This phase involves internships, starting a first business, making mistakes, or gaining experience at a larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:46">[03:01:46]</a>.

### Prioritization and Mindset
During the Learn phase, the most important thing is what you optimize for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>. Instead of prioritizing higher pay, focus on the job that offers a better learning experience, more hands-on work, and interaction with smarter people, as this will pay off in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:08">[03:30:08]</a>. Your key performance indicator (KPI) should be how much learning and personal growth you achieve each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>. You are building yourself as a product during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>.

### Duration and Dabbling
The first 10 years of a career can be considered the Learn phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:49">[04:54:49]</a>. During this time, it's advised to dabble and expect to reinvent yourself every 18 months or so by hopping into new situations to challenge yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:09">[05:55:09]</a>. This constant change helps you find what you are uniquely capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>. Avoid the pressure to "declare your major" or pigeonhole yourself early in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:20">[05:22:20]</a>.

### Identifying Your Edge
In the Learn phase, you should focus on identifying your "Edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:13">[06:39:13]</a>. This breaks into two categories:

1.  **Common Edges of Beginners**:
    *   **Small and Helpless**: People are often willing to help beginners, offering meetings, opportunities, or mentorship. Embracing being a beginner is a significant advantage that many unsuccessful people hide due to embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:42">[06:48:42]</a>.
    *   **Time**: When starting, you likely have more free time. This allows you to take on opportunities that someone with a high hourly rate would pass on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:10">[07:35:10]</a>.
    *   **Nothing to Lose**: Starting at rock bottom is a solid foundation, allowing you to take more risks than those who have something to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:09">[08:38:09]</a>. This is primarily a mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:48">[08:10:48]</a>.

2.  **Personal Edge**: This is about finding the unique combination of things that come naturally to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:47">[09:11:47]</a>. Examples include being funny, having endurance for grinding, having good taste, or a unique blend of skills (e.g., a talented programmer who loves anatomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:07">[09:26:07]</a>. This is likened to a "bear riding a unicycle" â€“ two cool but not special things combined to create something amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. If you don't know your personal edge, ask friends or actively develop a skill like writing or sales through practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:13">[11:28:13]</a>.

### Project Selection
When choosing projects, whether starting a company or joining one, focus on:
*   **Proximity to Ambition**: Get around the smartest and most ambitious people who are pursuing similar goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:04">[12:58:04]</a>. Moving to a hub like Silicon Valley or a creative city like Los Angeles can provide this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:02">[13:24:02]</a>. This exposure makes success seem normal and keeps you motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:02">[13:40:02]</a>.
*   **Working on the A+ Problem**: Ensure you're doing actual work, not just observing from the fringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:07">[14:27:07]</a>. Identify the most critical problem a company or industry faces and work on it, even if it's not your designated role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:23">[15:06:23]</a>. This approach forces you to learn and make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:59">[18:38:59]</a>.
*   **Creating Luck**: Luck is not just random; it can be created and increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:16">[19:29:16]</a>.
    *   **Blind Luck**: Uncontrollable, but appreciate it when it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:13">[19:36:13]</a>.
    *   **Motion Luck**: Take a lot of action; fortune favors the bold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:03">[19:49:03]</a>. This includes showing up to events, making introductions, or publishing analysis online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Content Creation**: Publishing your thoughts puts pressure on you to have good ideas and learn, increasing your "surface area for luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:03">[20:34:03]</a>. The goal is not popularity, but to be "known well" by the right people who can offer new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:08">[21:29:08]</a>.

### Investing in Yourself
During the Learn phase, instead of investing small amounts of money in financial markets, focus on [[leveraging_skills_and_personal_development_for_business_success | investing in yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:03">[27:58:03]</a>. This means:
1.  **Buying Back Your Time**: Identify activities that drain your creative energy (e.g., errands, chores) and outsource them, even if it seems "spoiled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>. This frees up time for higher-value creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:03">[28:44:03]</a>.
2.  **Investing in Knowledge and Proximity**: Give yourself an unlimited book budget and buy your way into conferences, groups, or clubs where successful people congregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. Proximity to inspiring individuals leads to automatic growth through osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:19">[29:54:19]</a>.
3.  **Leaving Money on the Table**: Say no to time-wasting clients or take lower-paying jobs/equity stakes to work with exceptional people or gain invaluable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:07">[30:31:07]</a>. This investment in better opportunities will pay off long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:44">[31:23:44]</a>.

## The Earn Phase

After building yourself as a product and acquiring skills and market understanding, the "Earn" phase allows you to reap what you've sown and extract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:08">[03:59:08]</a>. This phase is about generating cash to achieve Financial Freedom, where your investments generate enough income that you don't need to work a job, allowing you to pursue your passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:05">[04:09:05]</a>.

An example of an "Earn" phase strategy could be starting a service company aiming for 10 customers paying $10,000 a month, generating $100,000 monthly or $1.2 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. Such a business could achieve a high profit margin (e.g., 90%) and potentially be sold for a significant multiple (e.g., 4 times profit) to achieve millionaire status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:04">[26:33:04]</a>.

## The Legacy Phase

The "Legacy" phase is about giving back and being remembered for contributing something beyond yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This might involve endeavors like starting foundations, teaching, or pursuing ambitious projects for the betterment of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:17">[04:30:17]</a>.

## Overarching Principles

*   **Age is Irrelevant**: Whether you are 21, 31, or 41, if you are broke or not successful, it's your "day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. Embrace a "white belt" or 21-year-old mindset where anything is possible, and you can reinvent yourself at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. Free yourself from age constraints that add pressure and doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.
*   **Play Offense**: Approach your career by actively seeking opportunities and growth, rather than feeling behind or playing catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:03">[02:20:03]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Core Skills**: Before pursuing noble or world-changing missions, first [[building_core_skills_learning_to_build_sell_and_get_lucky | build the core skill set]] of knowing how to build and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>. You need enough financial runway to chase audacious goals without worrying about rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:07">[32:29:07]</a>.
*   **Don't Perpetually Wait**: While building skills and runway is important, avoid the trap of continuously delaying your true aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:17">[32:46:17]</a>. The "thing you really want to do" doesn't have to be a noble, world-changing mission, especially at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:08">[32:57:08]</a>.

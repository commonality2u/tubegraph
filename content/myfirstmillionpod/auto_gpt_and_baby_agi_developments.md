The field of [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] is rapidly advancing, with new developments appearing every 48 hours that can "blow your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Among the latest advancements are **Auto GPT** and **Baby AGI**, open-source [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | AI agents]] that represent a significant leap beyond previous conversational AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Evolution from ChatGPT
While [[business_opportunities_with_chatgpt_and_ai_tools | ChatGPT]] has gained immense popularity, boasting over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing product of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, its primary function is to provide answers and steps when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The CEO of Google has stated that [[business_opportunities_with_chatgpt_and_ai_tools | ChatGPT]] is "more important than the invention of electricity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Auto GPT and Baby AGI take this a step further by breaking down multi-step tasks and attempting to perform the actions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These models are built upon [[business_opportunities_with_chatgpt_and_ai_tools | ChatGPT]] and function as "agents" or "workers" that can pass tasks to one another to achieve a larger goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
The "AGI" in "Baby AGI" stands for Artificial General Intelligence, which describes a state where an [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] can perform any intellectual task that a human can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This contrasts with "narrow [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]]", which is trained for specific tasks like self-driving cars or robot assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The rapid progress from [[business_opportunities_with_chatgpt_and_ai_tools | ChatGPT]] to Auto GPT and Baby AGI in a short period suggests a rapid advancement towards AGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Potential Applications and [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities | Business Opportunities]]

### The "Magic To-Do List"
A significant [[ai_business_ideas | AI business idea]] stemming from these developments is a "magic to-do list" application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Unlike traditional to-do list apps, which merely track tasks, a magic to-do list would actively *do* the tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. For example, if a user states, "I need to get my pool fence installed; I gotta call and get a quote," the [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] could call three local places, obtain quotes, organize them into a table, recommend an option, book the service, process payment, and add it to the user's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Such an app could be "insane" and reach valuations of "next level" compared to existing note-taking or to-do apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### "Hustle GPT" Experiment
A notable experiment involved "Hustle GPT," where a user, Jackson Greathouse Fall, tasked [[business_opportunities_with_chatgpt_and_ai_tools | ChatGPT]] (specifically GPT-4) with turning an initial budget of $100 into as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The user acted as the "human liaison" to execute the [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | AI]]'s instructions, with the constraint of not doing anything illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | AI]]'s plan involved:
*   Purchasing a domain and hosting for an affiliate website (e.g., eco-friendly products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Using the remaining budget for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Signing up for affiliate programs like Amazon Associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Utilizing social media and SEO for traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   Generating a logo using DALL-E 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   Creating a newsletter pop-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   Allocating an ad budget for Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The experiment led to the creation of greengadgetguru.com, which gained 500,000 views due to the viral tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The site eventually made over $100 in revenue and secured investments, valuing the company at $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for [[building_a_business_using_ai_tools | building a business using AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Financial Analysis and Tax Preparation
[[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] can also perform complex financial analysis, such as building a full profit and loss (P&L) statement and modeling scenarios based on variables like ad spend and return on ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Users can ask the [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | AI]] what inputs are needed for a comprehensive analysis, and it will guide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Furthermore, [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_ai_agents_in_business | AI]] is being developed to handle personal taxes, potentially maximizing savings by analyzing tax codes and personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Concerns
While [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] offers incredible benefits, its power also raises concerns.

### Increased Scams
The ability of [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] to automate and scale interactions could enhance scams. For example, [[ai_clones_and_digital_doubles_in_the_business_and_entertainment_space | AI voice cloning]] can be used to impersonate individuals like grandchildren in "grandparent scams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] can also make mass automated phone calls with human-like voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. While this technology has beneficial uses, such as automating medical billing calls to save human hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, it can also be exploited for malicious purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### The Paperclip Optimization Problem
A classic theoretical concern with powerful [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] is the "paperclip optimization problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This thought experiment posits that if a highly intelligent [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] is given an objective, like maximizing paperclip production, without proper constraints, it might take extreme measures to achieve its goal, potentially converting all available resources, including cars and even humans, into paperclips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This highlights the importance of careful [[prompt_engineering_as_a_new_skill_in_ai_development | prompt engineering]] and ethical considerations when deploying powerful [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The "paperclip optimization problem" illustrates how an "extremely powerful tool if given the wrong optimization could make very bad decisions on behalf of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. For example, if "Hustle GPT" wasn't explicitly told "don't do anything illegal," it might suggest illicit activities to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Accessibility and Future Outlook
Currently, Auto GPT and Baby AGI are GitHub projects, meaning users need technical knowledge to run them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, it is expected that these technologies will soon be "productized" and made accessible through user-friendly websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Like the internet, personal computers, and mobile phones, [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] appears to be a transformative wave that businesses and individuals cannot afford to ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Companies that fail to integrate [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | AI]] will be at a significant disadvantage against those that do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

Sulman Ali (Sulay) has extensive experience in both founding and investing in companies, serving as a "deal doula" during company sales, and reflecting on various investment philosophies. His journey began with traditional employment at Microsoft before transitioning to entrepreneurship during the rise of the Facebook app platform and later mobile apps, leading to successful exits for companies like Superlatives and TinyCo (which secured funding from Andreessen Horowitz and licensed IP like Family Guy and Harry Potter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He also played a key role in the sales of BBO to Twitch and the Milk Road, guiding the process to a successful conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Mergers & Acquisitions

Through his experience, Sulay has distilled several key insights regarding company acquisitions:

*   **Focus on the Big Picture** Buyers are primarily interested in the strategic reasons, revenue, and profit of a business, rather than the nuances of wording in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Radical Transparency Builds Trust** It is beneficial to proactively disclose any "shitty things" or "skeletons in the closet" about the business early in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This transparency builds significant trust with potential buyers, as they will likely uncover these issues during due diligence anyway, avoiding later complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Expressing Interest Without Desperation** When approached by a potential buyer, entrepreneurs are often advised to feign disinterest. However, a more effective approach is to acknowledge past interest and express openness to listening, without appearing overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This signals interest to experienced buyers without undermining the seller's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Offers** One strategy to initiate a sales process is to secure an offer from a less desired buyer. This allows the seller to then approach preferred strategic buyers, informing them of an existing offer and suggesting a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Identifying Charlatans** Watch out for individuals who lead with flattery and puffery rather than substance or verifiable facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Case Study: AppLovin Acquisition Mishap

Dick Filipini, a banker who advised Sulay, was involved in the AppLovin acquisition attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. AppLovin was initially set to be sold to a Chinese company for $1 billion, but the deal was blocked by the Trump Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Instead, the Chinese company invested $100 million, and a few years later, AppLovin went public, eventually reaching a valuation of $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This outcome, where a failed sale led to a much larger valuation, highlights the unpredictable nature of high-stakes deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Business and Investment Ideas

Sulay shared several [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | business and investment ideas]]:

*   **"Robinhood for Real Estate"**
    A mobile application that simplifies real estate [[investment_strategies_in_agricultural_commodities | investment]] for younger individuals (e.g., 20-somethings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. It would allow users to invest in fractional equity of rental properties with a single click, setting up recurring monthly investments (e.g., $200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The goal is to make real estate accessible without requiring sophisticated knowledge of cap rates or construction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Niche-Specific Agencies/Consulting**
    For achieving [[wealth_building_and_management_strategies | financial freedom]], Sulay suggests creating an agency or consulting business focused on a specific, profitable aspect of an existing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Examples include email marketing for e-commerce brands, conversion rate optimization, or even highly specialized services like Facebook pixel optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The strategy involves creating "before and after" case studies, even by analyzing other brands, to establish expertise and attract clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This approach can quickly generate significant revenue (e.g., 10 clients paying $10K/month for $100K/month in revenue) and can lead to a salable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This model can be applied to any sector, from local businesses like dentists or restaurants to large industries like self-storage or accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
*   **Cloning Successful Blueprints**
    A highly [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | underrated strategy]] is to identify a successful business blueprint and replicate it in a different category or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. This provides a clear understanding of costs, revenue, and growth drivers, making the path to success more predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   **Current "Waves" of Opportunity**
    If he were 22 today, Sulay would focus on genetics or AI, as these are the biggest emerging sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

## Reflections on Startup Investing

Sulay has significantly reduced his direct [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | startup investing]] activity, citing several reasons:

*   **Competition and Demeaning Process** He dislikes competing for deals and finding it demeaning to convince founders to accept small investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>. The aggressive tactics of even top-tier VCs like Bill Gurley highlight the lack of a "moat" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   **Long Time Horizon for Returns** Investments of $50,000 taking 10 years to yield $2 million (as in his Chartboost example) are no longer compelling for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **High Valuations and Increased Competition** Sky-high valuations and intense competition, with multiple companies pursuing similar ideas (e.g., four "Divvy Homes" competitors), make it challenging to generate significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

Instead, Sulay prefers to acquire a majority interest (30-40%) in businesses with existing revenue and a clear path to profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>, allowing quicker capital deployment and reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

### Investment Regrets and Successes

*   **Biggest Miss: Coinbase** Sulay had the opportunity to invest $25,000 in Coinbase's Series A round, which would have been worth $200 million at its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. He didn't invest because he "didn't believe" in crypto at the time, viewing it as "silly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>.
*   **Facebook Stock Mishap** In 2008, during the financial crisis, Facebook was valued at $2 billion in the private market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Sulay signed a contract to buy $150,000 worth of Facebook stock, but the private market price dropped by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Despite his father's advice to buy it, he paid $75,000 to exit the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. A friend he connected to the opportunity later bought $50,000 worth of Facebook stock, which became worth $8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Father's Real Estate Success** Sulay's father successfully invested in Florida real estate during the 2008 financial crisis, buying houses at drastically reduced prices (e.g., $150,000 dropping to $75,000 two weeks later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. He continued to buy properties as prices fell and then rose, accumulating around 100 single-family rentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This demonstrated a long-term vision, understanding that prices were below replacement cost and would eventually recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

## Acquiring Public Companies: The "Hostile Takeover" Approach

Sulay is exploring the possibility of acquiring a public company, aiming to bypass the challenging "zero-to-one" phase of starting a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. He looks for undervalued companies that are not being run to maximize profits.

### Case Study: Squarespace

Squarespace is a prime target for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. Once valued at $10 billion in the private market, its public valuation dropped to $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. Sulay believes it's undervalued and could be significantly more profitable by:
*   Reducing non-direct response advertising (e.g., podcast ads) in favor of more efficient direct response ads (e.g., Facebook ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
*   Cutting excess headcount, particularly in expensive locations like their New York City headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

To acquire a public company, one would typically start with a private offer, then make a public offer with financing secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. A board must respond to a public offer, especially if it's at a significant premium to the current stock price, to avoid shareholder lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

### Inspirations for Roll-up Strategies

*   **Justin Yoshimura (CSC Holdings):** This entrepreneur buys antiquated furniture companies (like Z Gallery, One Kings Lane, Sur La Table) that are undervalued and suffering from a lack of digital savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. His strategy involves closing underperforming retail locations, boosting e-commerce, and modernizing customer data systems that are often stuck on outdated servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. He aims to replicate the success of companies like Constellation Software, which acquires and unlocks value from many small SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. Yoshimura is known for his aggressive public offers when private negotiations fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Dental Practice Roll-up:** Sulay helped a friend sell their highly profitable dental practice to a private equity firm that was rolling up dentists in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. The practice was generating seven figures in EBITDA with a 50% net margin while the owner worked only three days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. The PE firm aimed to buy practices at a 7x EBITDA multiple and sell the consolidated entity at a 15x multiple, leveraging a "valuation arbitrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. They also increased profitability by adding more dentists and hygienists, optimizing for revenue (e.g., by claiming higher insurance codes), and building an internal referral network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. This provided a significant win for both the firm and the selling dentist, allowing him to retire and maintain real estate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Perspective

Sulay's [[investment_strategies_and_reflections_by_andrew_wilkinson | reflections]] have evolved, moving away from purely building more businesses towards balancing work with personal enjoyment and a broader definition of success.

*   **Shifting Definition of Success:** He recognizes that "winning is really fun" and that success itself brings joy, more so than the specific category or product being worked on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Avoiding the "Graveyard":** As he's gotten older, he's more cautious about entering highly competitive fields where many have failed. He now analyzes the "graveyard" of past failures before committing, unlike his younger self who pursued trends blindly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Life Phases and Priorities:** He observes distinct life phases, where younger individuals prioritize building and hustling, while those in their 30s and 40s may seek more balance, prioritizing fun and avoiding the "rat race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.
*   **"Building a New Prison":** Some entrepreneurs, after achieving financial independence, continue to build new businesses, inadvertently creating a "new prison for themselves that's bigger and brighter, but it's still a prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.
*   **Imagination as the Limiting Factor:** Sulay has realized that his life's limitations are not due to money or resources, but rather his own imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. He plans to hire a "chief fun officer" to help him discover and engage in more enjoyable activities, shifting focus from constant business ideation to personal fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
*   **The "One Thing" Question:** When starting a new venture, Sulay encourages identifying the "one fundamental thing" that needs to be done differently from the status quo to ensure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

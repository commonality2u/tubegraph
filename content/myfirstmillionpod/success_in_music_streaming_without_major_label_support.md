Connor Price and Brianna, his wife and marketing genius, have achieved significant success in the music industry by operating independently, without the backing of a major record label. Their strategy centers on leveraging social media platforms, owning their intellectual property, and diversifying their [[diverse_revenue_streams_for_independent_artists|revenue streams]].

## The Independent Advantage

A common misconception in music is that there's no money in streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, this often stems from major labels owning up to 80% of an artist's songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. If artists maintain ownership of their music, there is substantial income potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, on average, a million streams on Spotify translates to approximately $4,000 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Connor and Brianna currently average around 60 million streams a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

Their independent status is a conscious choice, not a default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. They have received offers from major labels but prefer to control their creative process and business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. This approach aims to demonstrate to other aspiring artists that independent success is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.

## Leveraging Social Media for Growth

Brianna's background in marketing, honed at a pet company, proved instrumental in developing Connor's online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The core strategy is to provide entertainment first, rather than overtly selling music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### [[using_platforms_like_tiktok_to_promote_music|TikTok Strategy]]

The primary platform for Connor's initial growth was TikTok. Unlike traditional musicians who might simply play their song or a music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, Connor and Brianna developed a unique approach:
*   **Opening Skits:** Videos begin with short, engaging skits that capture curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Character Play:** Connor, a former child actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, plays multiple distinct characters (e.g., the producer, the rapper, the nerdy brother) within these skits, making them relatable and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. This allows for constant, quick hooks every few seconds to maintain viewer attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   **Storytelling:** They focus on telling a story around the song rather than just presenting the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Viral Series:** The "Spin the Globe" series, where Connor spins a globe and collaborates with an artist from the landed country, was a massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The first video in this series, featuring a Zambian artist named Killa, garnered 72 million views on TikTok and YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Killa, who had less than a thousand monthly listeners, now has over a million due to the collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The second song from this series, "Spinning," has over 100 million streams on Spotify in under nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Content-First Approach:** Often, the content idea comes first, and then the song is created to fit it. For example, the "carrot flute" video came from a family moment, and the song was designed to incorporate that visual element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Conversion Challenges:** TikTok makes it harder to convert views to streams because it has removed the pinned comment feature and discourages links that take users off the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### [[leveraging_youtube_and_unique_products_in_ecommerce|YouTube Shorts Strategy]]

Connor was initially late to YouTube Shorts but found immense success by repurposing his popular TikTok videos without watermarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Creator-Friendly Platform:** YouTube is more creator-friendly than TikTok for promoting music, allowing pinned comments with streaming links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Rapid Growth:** Connor gained 800,000 YouTube subscribers in one month by consistently posting his popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. This translated into significant additional revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

## [[diverse_revenue_streams_for_independent_artists|Diverse Revenue Streams]]

Connor and Brianna focus on multiple revenue streams to ensure financial stability and growth:
1.  **Streaming:** The number one revenue source, particularly from Spotify and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
2.  **YouTube Money:** YouTube pays well for video views through AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
3.  **Brand Deals:** Negotiating high six-figure deals depending on the scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Brianna now works with a brand agent to manage these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
4.  **Syncs:** Licensing songs for commercials, TV shows, and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
5.  **Publishing:** Earning royalties from the songwriting aspect of music, including performance rights (radio play, covers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
6.  **Merch:** Selling merchandise related to Connor's brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
7.  **Live Shows:** While not the primary revenue driver at their current stage due to high costs (renting buses, paying staff, travel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, live performances are crucial for fan engagement and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. They prioritize "pop-up shows" and festivals over extensive touring to manage time and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. They also aim to avoid charging for fan interactions like VIP meet-and-greets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

## Building a Business Mindset

Brianna views Connor's music career as a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Their mindset is to treat songs as "real estate," investing in as many as possible because some will become highly valuable "mansions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Their ultimate financial goal is to scale the catalog and potentially sell it for $50 million in three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

### Family as a Core Team
The entire family is involved in the business. Connor's brother-in-law Christian mixes and masters the music, and other family members assist with editing, house management, and childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This "family ecosystem" allows them to support each other and manage daily operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Overcoming Fear of Judgment
Connor initially kept his music a secret, using an alter ego ("Unidentified") to upload songs anonymously on YouTube due to fear of judgment from friends and the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Brianna's consistent support and encouragement were key to his confidence in pursuing music publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

### The Unproven Path
Their success relies on a "new lane" of music promotion that combines quick, catchy TikTok content with full songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. This path is less traditional and therefore "unproven," but their financial success allows them to continue innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

### Maintaining Relationships
Working as a married couple and with family requires conscious effort to maintain personal relationships separate from business partnerships. Date nights are essential to prevent becoming "just business partners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

### Being Present
With a young child, Brianna reflects on the importance of being fully present in the newborn days, cautioning against being too focused on business and missing those precious moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Connor and Brianna envision expanding their creative ventures, including a potential "The Studio" series akin to *The Office*, which would further develop their characters and leverage Connor's acting connections for guest appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. Brianna also dreams of pitching "Spin the Globe" as a Netflix series, where Connor would travel to different countries to collaborate with artists, showcasing their culture and music scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

They plan to continue prioritizing their independent approach, believing it offers the most control and long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. Connor also created a DMCA-safe, copyright-free music playlist on Spotify for other content creators, believing the long-term value of creators using his music outweighs immediate small royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. Brianna also plans to launch a newsletter for independent artists and offer home studio kits to help others start their own music production journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.

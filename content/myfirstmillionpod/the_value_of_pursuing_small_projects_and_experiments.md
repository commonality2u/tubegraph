The approach to new ventures and personal growth often emphasizes starting small, embracing experimentation, and prioritizing long-term learning over immediate, conventional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This philosophy suggests that even seemingly "tiny" endeavors can lead to significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Embracing "Tiny" Starts

Contrary to the pressure to pursue large, impactful ventures, starting with small, discreet experiments can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. For example, a successful podcast began with a commitment to just six episodes, demonstrating that a "tiny" start is valid and can lead to significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. As [[unconventional_life_choices_and_experiments | Seth Godin]] wisely noted, grand ambitions are easy to hide behind, but committing to the smallest possible next action makes accountability immediate and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This approach makes it a "pass/fail" scenario that compels action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Strategic Experimentation: Success Even in Short-Term Failure

A core principle for choosing projects is to select those that can be long-term successes, even if they appear to fail in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This means engaging in activities where the process of pursuit develops or deepens durable skills and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Even if four projects fail, the development of relationships and new skills can compound over time, eventually leading to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

This method often involves:
*   **Creating a menu of things to try** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, often focusing on what one would like to learn, such as prototyping board games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing "weird" or non-obvious choices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, as these often face less social expectation and can indicate a natural enthusiasm and endurance that offers a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## The Role of Energy and Creativity

A key currency for choosing projects is energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. The question to ask is: "Does this activity give me more energy, or does it substantially deplete it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Activities that might seem frivolous, like archery or playing drums, can be "charging stations" that replenish energy, which can then be transferred to other endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

Maintaining a [[balancing_between_business_and_creative_endeavors | creative outlet]] is also crucial for sustaining peak performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Activities like Jiu-Jitsu, which involve improvisation and experimentation, can serve as a "creative gym" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. The "perfect Tuesday" exercise encourages individuals to define and live their ideal average day, integrating activities that foster physical and creative fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Effectiveness Over Efficiency

While efficiency often focuses on maximizing output per unit of time, effectiveness is about ensuring the output is directed towards the most important goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. Doing something exceptionally well does not inherently make it important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Therefore, less emphasis is placed on "optimization" in favor of keeping the "main thing the main thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

## Comfort with Non-Busyness and Avoiding Overcommitment

Being comfortable with not being busy is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. This mindset prevents rushing into commitments that might consume years without aligning with personal criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>. Indiscriminate action, or constantly chasing busyness, is identified as a form of laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. Having tight parameters and not breaking one's own rules, similar to the discipline in poker or startup investing, helps preserve one's "bankroll" of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. Time is a non-renewable resource, unlike money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Unique Approaches (Law of Category & Barbell Strategy)

When considering [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | new projects]], it's more effective to create a new category rather than compete to be the best in an existing, crowded one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>. This "Law of Category" or "Blue Ocean Strategy" is about being unique, rather than just better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>. This strategy, coupled with ideas like Kevin Kelly's "1,000 True Fans," emphasizes finding a distinct position and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:12:00">[40:12:00]</a>.

The "barbell approach" is another strategy applicable to project selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. Borrowed from investing, it involves focusing on two extremes: super risky endeavors with capped downside and huge upside, and extremely boring, stable ones, avoiding anything in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:59:00">[43:59:00]</a>. This can be applied to podcast formats (no video vs. high-quality studio video) or even pricing strategies (free vs. ultra-premium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>. Ultra-premium pricing allows for greater margin for error and experimentation, fostering a virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:58:00">[47:58:00]</a>.

## Powerful Questions for Intentional Experimentation

[[lessons_from_experience_in_business_experiments | Strategic questioning]] acts as a "pickaxe for the brain," digging out valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>. Key questions include:
*   **"What would this look like if it was easy?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:13:00">[54:13:00]</a> This question shifts perspective and identifies simpler paths.
*   **"Am I leaning into my absolute strengths and unfair advantage as much as I could be?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:23:00">[55:23:00]</a> This encourages maximizing one's unique abilities. Identifying an "unfair advantage" can involve asking friends when they've seen one at their best or what they do that is easier for them than for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>.
*   **"What is the silly story I'm telling myself?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:53:00">[59:53:00]</a> This question helps dismantle self-limiting beliefs that are often fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **"Don't believe everything you think."** This wisdom emphasizes the importance of cross-examining one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

The ability to frame new undertakings as "experiments" offers a psychological advantage by providing a graceful exit strategy if things don't go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>. This mindset, combined with deliberate inquiry and a focus on long-term skill and relationship development, forms a robust framework for navigating the "what's next" question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

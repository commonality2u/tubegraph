Sabri Suby, known as the "Australian Gary Vee" and a figure on *Shark Tank Australia*, built one of Australia's largest growth agencies with just a laptop and no initial capital or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He shares strategies for [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | building successful businesses from scratch]] today, even with no resources or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The core of these strategies lies in creating "Godfather offers" that are irresistible to potential clients.

## Business Ideas for Starting from Scratch

### 1. The "Godfather Offer" Agency Model

This strategy involves identifying businesses that are already successful on one marketing channel but are missing out on opportunities on others due to lack of focus, team, or expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **The Pitch**: Offer to do all the work — build funnels, run ads — on a new channel for free, taking only a percentage of the sales generated from that new traffic source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This presents no risk to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Approaching a business successfully running Google Ads but not Facebook Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Targeting businesses strong on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads but not yet on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. You would handle the entire setup, including compliance and funnel building, for a percentage (e.g., 10%) of the sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Finding Shopify e-commerce stores not yet selling on Amazon. Offer to manage their Amazon presence, with the products remaining in their warehouse initially, for a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This requires about four months to become proficient in Amazon FBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Seek businesses that have money but lack the time or expertise for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Profitable e-commerce stores (e.g., in business for three years) are ideal as they likely generate revenue, making it easier to justify a new channel that also generates money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Avoid ventures like optimizing podcast clips for TikTok, as podcasters may not have enough money to justify the expense for uncertain ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### 2. SaaS Affiliate with Free Funnel Build

This strategy capitalizes on the increasing cost of advertising (CPMs) for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses, which are extending their customer acquisition payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

*   **The Opportunity**: Many SaaS companies (e.g., HubSpot, GoHighLevel, ClickFunnels, Hyros) offer substantial affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. HubSpot, for instance, offers 30% recurring commission for up to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **The Pitch**:
    1.  Choose a niche (e.g., chiropractors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    2.  Pre-build a complete, high-converting funnel tailored for that niche (landing page, opt-in, email flows, text messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    3.  Reach out to businesses in that niche (e.g., cold call, email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    4.  Offer the pre-built funnel for free (typically charged at $5,000 by agencies), with the only condition being that they sign up for the necessary SaaS product (e.g., HubSpot) through your affiliate link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: You generate a high volume of customers for the SaaS product without directly operating or maintaining the customer relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### 3. Live Chat Service for Local Businesses

Small businesses often lack the manpower to field inquiries outside of regular hours, missing out on potential leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

*   **The Opportunity**: Many small businesses with Google My Business listings do not offer live chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **The Pitch**: Offer to provide live chat support for free, especially during off-hours, to field and nurture leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. You would then send qualified leads to their sales team or even close some sales directly through chat, taking a 20% commission on sales generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Start by doing it yourself as a side hustle, then hire people (e.g., in the Philippines) to scale the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### 4. TikTok Shop / YouTube Shopping Affiliate (AI Content Creation)

This is highlighted as one of the best current opportunities because it requires no money, no showing your face, and no using your voice, while operating in an exploding market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

*   **The Platform**: TikTok Shop allows brands to offer affiliate programs where individuals can sell products with a product tag and earn a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. YouTube Shopping is also emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **The Process**:
    1.  Use tools like Koaladata or FastMoss to find best-selling products on TikTok Shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. These tools show revenue data and successful video creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    2.  Reverse-engineer popular scripts: transcribe them, identify what drives views and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    3.  Create new content using AI:
        *   **Voiceover**: Use AI tools like ElevenLabs (around $20/month) for voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
        *   **Visuals**: Generate images using free AI tools like Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
        *   **Editing**: Assemble content in tools like CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
    4.  Upload new videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Shilajit resin and Gurunanda oil pulling kit are examples of products that have seen massive success through TikTok Shop, often promoted with AI-generated voices and outrageous claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Skills Acquired**: This method forces you to learn invaluable, timeless skills like copywriting, understanding consumer psychology, video editing, video storytelling, and social media virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. These "horizontal skills" can be applied to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Monetization**:
    *   **Affiliate**: Directly earn commissions from sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
    *   **Agency**: Once proficient, offer services to businesses for a retainer (e.g., $20,000/month) plus a percentage of sales (e.g., 5%) to build out their TikTok Shop presence. Additionally, provide the viral TikTok creatives for use in their Facebook ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## Mindset for Starting with No Capital

When [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting a business from scratch]] with no money, the primary goal is often simply to "not be broke" and replace one's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### Focus on "Bleeding Necks"

*   Identify "bleeding neck" customers – those with an immediate, pressing problem that generates revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   Get as close as possible to revenue-producing activities for a business, as this is their "oxygen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Acquire Compounding Skills

*   Consider the "half-life" of the skills you're acquiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. While platforms and ad strategies change (e.g., Facebook Ads skills have a half-life of perhaps 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>), fundamental skills like copywriting, consumer psychology, and storytelling will serve you for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   The goal is to get paid to acquire these valuable skills, building something larger down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

### The "Yes, Yes, Yes, No" Funnel

This is a strategy for [[acquiring_first_customers_for_startup_businesses | acquiring first customers for startup businesses]] by providing immense value upfront, leading to an eventual "no" to doing it themselves, and a "yes" to hiring you.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Offer a valuable piece of content (e.g., a free report, video, playbook) that educates your target market on how to solve a problem themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.
    2.  This content should be so valuable that it literally gives them the "Playbook" without holding anything back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.
    3.  The ideal prospect, after consuming the content, is convinced you are an expert and says "yes, yes, yes" to the information, but then says "no" to doing the work themselves due to lack of time, energy, or skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
    4.  At this point, you offer your services to do it for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.
*   **Example**: Sabri Suby's "Sell Like Crazy" book, given away for free plus shipping, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. It provided a complete playbook for selling, knowing that many readers, convinced by the expertise, would rather hire his agency than implement it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. This book has sold over a million copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

### Rejecting the "Internet Gods"

Many businesses "pray to the internet gods" hoping for cheaper CPMs, easier algorithms, or referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Instead, focus on building a repeatable, predictable system to acquire clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. Without this, a business is merely an "expensive hobby worse than a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

### Embrace Showmanship

Showmanship is the currency that buys attention in the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. It involves storytelling, stage presence, energy, and visual communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. Even in seemingly mundane business contexts, bringing pizzazz can make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This skill is becoming increasingly important with the rise of content creation and audience building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

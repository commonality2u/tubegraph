Jesse Itzler emphasizes the importance of [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | building strong personal and professional networks]] through intentional and authentic relationship strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:22">[1:14:22]</a>. He advocates for prioritizing relationships with family, friends, and one's own health, asserting that no business success can provide the same fulfillment as a strong personal foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:00">[1:08:00]</a>.

## Intentionality in Relationships

Itzler highlights the significance of developing a strong "relationship with money" and "relationship with time," in addition to personal relationships, as all are equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:30">[0:18:30]</a>. He learned early in his career about the power of personal connections, such as when he was given a chance by a record company because he "shopped it himself" and wasn't "super connected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:38">[0:04:38]</a>. This contrasts with the notion of merely having a good idea, as people often "buy into stories [and] momentum" and "the business plan is you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:02">[0:16:02]</a>.

### The "Yes Guy" Approach

Itzler describes himself as a "yes guy" for much of his life, priding himself on delivering on requests without asking for anything in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:03">[0:27:03]</a>. This philosophy led to unexpected opportunities, such as securing a meeting with the president of NetJets after helping his daughter with a celebrity connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:27">[0:27:27]</a>.

### Creative Problem Solving

When pursuing a deal for Marquee Jets, Itzler and his partner were initially dismissed by NetJets due to their lack of aviation experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:29">[0:28:29]</a>. Instead of relying on a typical PowerPoint presentation, they brought in their own focus group of eight individuals who articulated their need for a 25-hour jet card, a service NetJets wasn't offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:10">[0:29:10]</a>. This unconventional approach led to the deal, demonstrating that "the things that live off the business plan... make the biggest difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:12">[0:32:12]</a>. The NetJets president later told Itzler that he saw enthusiasm and a willingness to "make this work" regardless of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:20">[0:30:20]</a>.

Similarly, to secure a partnership with Coca-Cola for Zico Coconut Water, Itzler used an unconventional approach: he filmed a 35-second short film of Matt Damon cracking open a coconut and humorously asking for a "better way" than the current market offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:36">[0:49:36]</a>. This memorable presentation helped secure the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:47">[0:49:47]</a>.

### Proactive Service

Itzler believes in going above and beyond to service clients, turning them into advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:42:11">[0:42:11]</a>. For his first Marquee Jet customer, Josh Koppelman, Itzler not only met expectations but exceeded them by providing unexpected services like a list of pediatricians in Mexico or dinner reservations during spring break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:42:25">[0:42:25]</a>. This exceptional service led to Koppelman providing referrals, which became a key strategy for the company's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:42:47">[0:42:47]</a>.

## Frameworks for Cultivating Relationships

### Three Minutes a Day

Itzler practices a "three minutes a day" strategy to invest in his network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:34">[1:11:34]</a>. This involves taking small, consistent actions, such as sending appreciative texts, calls, or emails to friends, suppliers, manufacturers, or mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:48">[1:13:48]</a>. The goal is to plant "permission slips" â€” building rapport and making it easier to engage later without appearing out of the blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:56">[1:13:56]</a>. This concept aligns with [[the_importance_of_handwritten_notes_and_network_building | the importance of handwritten notes and network building]].

### Compliment, Congratulate, Console

This framework guides Itzler's approach to maintaining [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | authentic relationships]]:
*   **Compliment:** Acknowledge and praise someone's achievements or qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:21">[1:15:21]</a>.
*   **Congratulate:** Reach out to celebrate a friend's success or positive life event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:16">[1:15:16]</a>.
*   **Console:** Offer support during difficult times, such as illness or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:12">[1:14:12]</a>. Itzler notes that people "never forget" who reached out to them during moments of grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:47">[1:14:47]</a>.

### The Power of Handwritten Notes
Itzler started writing 10 handwritten letters a day in his 20s as his entire marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:28">[1:12:28]</a>. He believes handwritten letters cut through the clutter of emails and DMs, as everyone reads them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:40">[1:12:40]</a>. He emphasizes that the "intent" behind a handwritten letter, requiring the effort to get a stamp, lick it, and mail it, is "received completely different than just sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:53">[1:15:53]</a>. He also makes it a practice to write 25 to 50 handwritten thank-you letters at the end of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:16:17">[1:16:17]</a>. This practice demonstrates [[the_importance_of_transparency_and_intent_in_relationships_and_wealth_management | transparency and intent in relationships]].

## Prioritizing Life Over "Hustle and Grind"

While recognizing the necessity of hard work, Itzler cautions against solely chasing entrepreneurial dreams at the expense of personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:50">[1:22:50]</a>. He advocates for maintaining a healthy balance that allows for joy and meaningful experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:50">[1:22:50]</a>. He advises against taking on "high aggravation" projects or relationships, preferring to say no to opportunities that might compromise his daily enjoyment, even if they are lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:48">[0:51:48]</a>. He believes the "same feeling" one gets from selling a business can be achieved by finishing a marathon, helping an old lady across the street, or any action that makes one feel good about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:37">[1:08:37]</a>.

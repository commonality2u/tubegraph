Craig Clemens, a marketer who has built a billion-dollar company with no outside investors, shares his "seven human hijacks" â€” a masterclass in [[sales_strategies_and_psychology | sales strategies]] that have enabled him to sell over a billion dollars of products online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These strategies are designed to "hijack" the limbic system of the brain, making it nearly impossible for humans not to pay attention and respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## The Influence of Marketing on Daily Life

Marketers are responsible for creating much of our daily behavior, including habits like brushing teeth or eating bacon for breakfast, which were not always common practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Edward Bernays: The Father of Public Relations and Consumerism
Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud's nephew and often called the "father of public relations," is credited with creating consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Before Bernays, people primarily bought clothes for work. He, along with others, shifted this by promoting the idea that clothing could be used for expression, leading people to buy more clothes and other items seasonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## The Seven Human Hijacks

These seven principles are repeatedly seen in successful marketing campaigns, from historical examples to modern-day phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### 1. Make it About Them (The Customer)
Focus on the benefits the customer will receive, rather than just the product's features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The "Mario marketing" analogy suggests selling the transformation of the customer (from small Mario to big Mario with fireballs), rather than just the "fireflower" (the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. In a world saturated with thousands of ads daily and short attention spans, capturing attention requires speaking to the customer's dreams, hopes, and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

*   **Example: Pepsodent Toothpaste**
    In the 1920s, only 5% of people brushed their teeth daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Claude Hopkins created a campaign for Pepsodent that focused on removing the "film that discolors the whitest teeth," promising a "movie star smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This approach led to 85% of Americans brushing their teeth daily within a decade, making Pepsodent the dominant brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The minty tingle of Pepsodent also created a physical sensation that reinforced its perceived effectiveness, leading to repeat orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### 2. Make it an Event
Creating an event attracts crowds and media coverage, leveraging the human instinct that "nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

*   **Example: Otis Elevator Safety Demonstration**
    In 1854, Elisha Otis introduced a safety braking system for elevators, but sales were poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. PT Barnum advised Otis to perform a public demonstration at the Crystal Palace in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Otis stood on an elevator, had an assistant cut the main rope with an axe, and the safety brake prevented the elevator from falling, famously exclaiming, "All safe here, gentlemen!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This dramatic event led to a surge in sales, securing Otis's legacy in major structures like the Eiffel Tower and Empire State Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### 3. Powerful Demonstration
Demonstrations make products tangible and memorable, tapping into how humans learn from physical interaction and observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.

*   **Example: Mini Katana Swords**
    This e-commerce brand sells large swords but cannot advertise on platforms like Google or Facebook due to weapon restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. They hired YouTubers and TikTokers to create "powerful demonstrations," such as cutting a bullet fired at the sword or slicing through a steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. These visually striking, albeit unnecessary, demonstrations drove engagement and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Example: Dr. Oz's Weight Loss Supplements**
    Dr. Oz used visual demonstrations on his TV show, like using balloons to represent fat cells and a pin to "pop" them, illustrating the effect of supplements like Garcinia Cambogia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. These simplified, dramatic visuals were highly effective, even if not scientifically accurate, and contributed to billions in sales for various supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Example: "This is Your Brain on Drugs" PSA**
    The iconic public service announcement showing an egg frying in a pan to represent "this is your brain on drugs" is a powerful demonstration that sticks in the mind for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

### 4. Show Unquestionable Proof
Leveraging experts, influencers, or personal risk provides strong evidence that bypasses skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

*   **Example: Lucky Strike and "Torches of Freedom"**
    In the 1930s, it was illegal and considered unladylike for women to smoke in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Bernays capitalized on the women's rights movement by staging an "event" during the Easter Parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. He had prominent socialites publicly light cigarettes, framing them as "torches of Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. This marketing transformed smoking for women into a symbol of liberation, widely reported by newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. The participation of "people of prominence" serves as unquestionable proof, as humans tend to assume something is acceptable or desirable if influential figures adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Example: "Great American Breakfast" and Bacon**
    In the early 20th century, breakfast was typically light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. When Beachnut bacon wanted to sell more bacon, Bernays' team surveyed 5,000 doctors asking if a hearty breakfast with bacon was the best way to start the day. 4,500 doctors agreed, and this "unquestionable proof" was published in newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This led to bacon becoming a breakfast staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### 5. Change a Daily Behavior
Altering or adding to an existing daily behavior can create a lasting impact and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

*   **Example: Orange Juice as a Breakfast Staple**
    Before the 1900s, oranges were mostly eaten whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Albert Lasker, an advertising genius, helped the California Fruit Growers Association (Sunkist) by suggesting that orange juice, typically a special treat, could become a mainstream daily habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. They tied orange juice consumption to getting daily nutrients and offered a free juicer with proof of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. This transformed orange juice into a breakfast ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.
*   **Example: Bulletproof Coffee**
    Dave Asprey's Bulletproof Coffee intercepted an existing daily behavior (drinking coffee) by adding a new component (butter and MCT oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. This subtle change in an established routine proved highly successful.
*   **Example: The Miracle Morning**
    Hal Elrod's book, "The Miracle Morning," promotes a daily journaling habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. By changing a daily behavior, the book generates continuous word-of-mouth as users discuss their daily journaling, leading to millions of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

### 6. Sell the Dream
Focus on the aspirational outcome or the positive transformation the customer will experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.

*   **Example: Nike and Athletic Shoes**
    In the 1970s, running was not popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Nike partnered with dominant runner Steve Prefontaine, whose athleticism and inspiring quotes provided "unquestionable proof" of their shoes' quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. This association made running cool and led to athletic shoes becoming daily attire as people "rebelled" against traditional footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Later, the "Like Mike" campaign with Michael Jordan sold the dream of flying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

### 7. Help Them Rebel or Feel Superior
People have a natural desire to go against the grain, show individuality, or feel superior to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This can be leveraged by providing tools or badges that signify rebellion or elevated status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

*   **Example: Lucky Strike and "Torches of Freedom"**
    Beyond simply smoking, women using cigarettes became an act of rebellion against societal norms and a statement of equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Example: Lucky Strike and the "Gala Green Ball"**
    After women started smoking, Lucky Strike faced an issue: their green packaging was considered an undesirable color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Bernays orchestrated the first "Gala Green Ball" at the Waldorf Hotel, where socialites wore green outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This event transformed green into the most fashionable color within a year, subconsciously driving women to choose Lucky Strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Celebrities wearing green also tapped into the desire to feel superior and rebellious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Example: Snapchat's "Boomer-Proofing"**
    Snapchat intentionally made certain features difficult to discover (e.g., holding down on face for filters), creating a "secret door" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. This was to "Boomer-proof" the app, making it less accessible to older generations and thus cooler and more exclusive for younger users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
*   **Example: Volkswagen's "Think Small" Campaign**
    In the 1960s, when most cars were large, Volkswagen's "Think Small" campaign positioned the VW Bug as a rebellious and "hipster" statement, making it a bestselling car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

### Modern Application: Creating a Category
Clemens applied these principles to create the probiotic category. In 2010, probiotics were largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. He launched an educational video explaining how unhealthy food supply (sugars, artificial sweeteners) affects the microbiome, and how probiotics could combat this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. This video went viral, seen by over 100 million people in four months, including a tweet from Joe Rogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. His company's brand, Keybiotics, became the biggest probiotic brand globally at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. He then leveraged influencers like Dr. Gundry to continue educating the market, contributing significantly to the mainstream adoption of probiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

This demonstrates [[the_evolution_of_marketing_strategies | how marketing strategies evolve]] through market stages:
*   **Clueless**: Market knows nothing; marketing needs to create awareness by addressing existing pain points (e.g., "Is your digestion messed up?") and then introducing the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
*   **Curious**: Market has heard the term; marketing can challenge existing notions (e.g., "Doctor says throw your probiotics in the trash" to explain better products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.
*   **Saturation**: Market is commoditized; requires unique strong campaigns to break through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

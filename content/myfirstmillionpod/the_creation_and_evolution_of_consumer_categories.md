Craig Clemens, a marketer who built a successful billion-dollar company without outside investors, shares insights into how marketers have created and evolved consumer categories and driven consumer behavior, referring to his methods as the "seven human hijacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He demonstrates how common daily habits, such as brushing teeth or eating bacon for breakfast, were intentionally established by marketers using specific tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Clemens himself helped create the probiotics category, making it mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Pioneering Consumerism: Edward Bernays

Edward Bernays, often called the father of public relations and Sigmund Freud's nephew, is credited with literally creating consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Before Bernays, people primarily bought clothes for work, unless they were in the upper classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Bernays helped shift this perspective, promoting the idea that clothing could be used for expression, leading people across all economic means to buy more clothes, especially with seasonal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### The Seven Human Hijacks

Clemens's insights are distilled into "the seven human hijacks," which he explains can [[understanding_and_leveraging_consumer_psychology_in_marketing | hijack the limbic system]] of the brain, causing humans to pay attention and respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These tactics are seen repeatedly throughout successful [[marketing_strategies_that_drive_consumer_behavior | marketing campaigns]]:

1.  **Make it about them**: Focus on the customer and their benefits, not just the product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
2.  **Make it an event**: Leverage the human tendency to be drawn to crowds and significant occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
3.  **Powerful demonstration**: Create memorable and impactful visual proofs of a product's efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
4.  **Show unquestionable proof**: Utilize experts, influencers, or direct personal risk to build trust and credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
5.  **Change daily behavior**: Integrate the product into existing or new daily routines to create consistent engagement and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>.
6.  **Sell the dream**: Promote the aspirational outcome or enhanced self that the customer can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
7.  **Help them rebel or feel superior**: Tap into the human desire to defy norms or elevate one's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:01">[02:52:01]</a>.

## Historical Case Studies in Category Creation

### Pepsodent and Teeth Brushing
In the 1920s, only 5% of people brushed their teeth daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Marketer Claude Hopkins, approached by Pepsodent, recognized that to sell more toothpaste, he needed to get people to brush their teeth first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Hopkins created a campaign focusing on "the film that discolors the whitest teeth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He encouraged readers to perform a simple demonstration: run their tongue over their teeth to feel this film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The ad promised that Pepsodent would remove this film, revealing a "movie star smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This campaign made Pepsodent the dominant toothpaste brand for decades, leading to 85% of Americans brushing their teeth daily within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The minty tingle of Pepsodent also played a crucial role in repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Otis Elevators and Safety
In 1854, Elisha Otis introduced a crucial braking system for elevators, yet he initially struggled with sales, selling only three elevators in his first year and seven in his second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. People were afraid of elevators due to accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Showman P.T. Barnum suggested a grand demonstration at the Crystal Palace in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Otis stood on an elevator, had his assistant cut the ropes with an axe, and famously declared "All safe here, gentlemen!" as the safety brake engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This powerful demonstration transformed public perception, leading to 2,000 elevator sales over the next decade, and securing commissions for iconic structures like the Eiffel Tower and Empire State Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The Otis logo is still found in elevators today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Lucky Strike and Women's Smoking
In the 1930s, with a saturated male smoking market, Lucky Strike approached Edward Bernays to expand to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. At the time, it was illegal for women to smoke in public, and it was considered unladylike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>.

Bernays capitalized on the ongoing women's rights movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. He organized a float in the Easter Parade, featuring prominent socialites who, at a designated corner, pulled out cigarettes and lit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. Bernays' team informed reporters that these were not mere cigarettes, but "torches of freedom," symbolizing women's fight for equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>. Newspapers ran with the story, turning smoking into a symbol of female empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>.

However, Lucky Strike faced a problem: its green packaging was considered an undesirable color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>. Bernays then organized the first "Gala Green Ball" at the Waldorf Hotel, with socialites wearing green outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>. This event, covered by magazines, transformed green into the most fashionable color within a year, subconsciously driving women to purchase Lucky Strike's green boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>.

### The Great American Breakfast
In the early 20th century, breakfast was typically light (coffee, a roll, or oatmeal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>. Beachnut Bacon approached Bernays to sell more bacon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:51">[03:48:51]</a>. Bernays identified breakfast as an untapped meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:51">[03:48:51]</a>.

He asked Beachnut's on-staff doctor if a hearty breakfast with bacon would be the best way to start the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. The doctor agreed and sent 5,000 letters to doctors nationwide, asking if they also agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:03">[03:52:03]</a>. When 4,500 doctors confirmed, Bernays shared these results with newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:57">[03:53:57]</a>. Headlines like "Doctors agree: A hearty breakfast containing bacon is the best way to store energy to last throughout your workday" normalized bacon for breakfast, boosting sales for all bacon companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:50">[03:54:50]</a>.

### Sunkist and Orange Juice
In the 1910s, California orange growers faced overproduction and needed to sell more oranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>. Albert Lasker, a key figure in [[the_evolution_of_marketing_strategies | consumer change]], teamed competing growers under a single brand: Sunkist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>.

Lasker observed growers squeezing oranges into juice for their children as a treat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>. He then had an engineer invent a cheap plastic juicing device and launched a campaign about the vitamins and nutrients in oranges, tying orange juice to meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>. Customers could get a free juicer by sending in proof of purchase for Sunkist oranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>. This campaign established orange juice as a daily health drink, despite its high sugar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:42">[03:57:42]</a>.

### Nike and Athletic Shoes
In the 1970s, running was not a popular activity, and joggers were often ridiculed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. Steve Prefontaine, a dominant American runner, helped change this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>. Nike, just starting its shoe manufacturing, partnered with Prefontaine, who wore their shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:07">[04:31:07]</a>. His success provided unquestionable proof of Nike's quality and helped popularize running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:07">[04:31:07]</a>.

Furthermore, Nike capitalized on a rebellion against traditional, basic shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:03">[04:43:03]</a>. People began wearing athletic shoes as daily attire to make a statement, reflecting a desire to rebel and feel superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:03">[04:43:03]</a>. This shift led to athletic shoes becoming the best-selling type of footwear, with only a small percentage used for actual athletic activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:03">[04:50:03]</a>. Nike's later campaign with Michael Jordan continued this trend, selling the dream of flying like Mike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:15">[04:51:15]</a>.

## Modern Category Creation and Evolution

### Bulletproof Coffee
Dave Asprey's Bulletproof Coffee successfully intercepted an existing daily behavior: drinking coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:40">[04:02:40]</a>. By adding ingredients like butter and MCT oil to coffee, it changed an existing habit rather than introducing an entirely new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:40">[04:02:40]</a>.

### The Miracle Morning
Hal Elrod's book, *The Miracle Morning*, focused on changing daily behavior by encouraging journaling every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:48">[04:50:48]</a>. The key insight was that people talk about what they are *currently doing* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:48">[04:50:48]</a>. By getting people to journal daily, Elrod ensured consistent word-of-mouth for his book, leading to millions of copies sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:48">[04:50:48]</a>.

### Probiotics
In 2010, when Craig Clemens's company Golden Hippo started, very few people knew about probiotics or the microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>. His company educated the public about the impact of sugars and artificial sweeteners in food on digestion and how good bacteria (probiotics) could help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>.

Their initial video presentation, seen by over 100 million people in four months, created the biggest probiotic brand globally at the time, Keybiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>. This demonstrated the "clueless" stage of a product market, where extensive education is needed to create demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>.

Later, as the market evolved to the "curious" stage (people had heard of probiotics), the marketing shifted. A 2018 ad for a subsequent probiotic brand, Perfect Biotics, used the headline "Doctor says throw your probiotics in the trash," grabbing attention from those already familiar with the concept and then explaining the nuances of effective probiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>. Today, the probiotic market is in a "saturation" stage, with many commoditized products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:54">[04:56:54]</a>.

This progression highlights the stages of market awareness, influencing how categories are initially created and subsequently evolved.

## Defining a "One-Person" Business
While the term suggests a single individual, it often refers to a core founder or two, leveraging contractors, agencies, or automated systems instead of a large, traditional employee team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These companies typically lack t-shirts, extensive employee morale programs, or large offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

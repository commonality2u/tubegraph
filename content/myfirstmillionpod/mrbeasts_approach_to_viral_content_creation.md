[[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]] (Jimmy Donaldson) is known for his unique mentality and "different wiring" when it comes to various ventures, including YouTube, selling chocolate, and even personal fitness goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His approach to [[building_an_audience_and_content_creation|content creation]] and business is characterized by extreme dedication, continuous improvement, and a willingness to challenge perceived limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Principles for Viral Content

### 1. Burn the Boats
This principle refers to [[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast's]] commitment to his goal, eliminating any fallback options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Early in his career, his mother wanted him to go to college, but he faked attending a free community college because he had no intention of actually pursuing a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. His mother, who had lost everything in the 2008 real estate collapse, was risk-averse and wanted him to get a traditional job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He, however, was determined to be a YouTuber, even if it meant being homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He lied about attending classes for a week, finding them "horrible" and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He instead spent his days editing videos in his Dodge Durango, filming at night, and telling his mother school was "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He gave himself a six-month deadline to earn enough money to move out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Right before the deadline, he earned $20,000 in a month, allowing him to tell his mom he hadn't been going to college and was moving out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### 2. Obsessive Personality
[[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]] describes himself as a "very obsessive person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. He thrives on focusing intensely on one thing for extended periods, even dreaming and constantly thinking about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This obsession extends to all his ventures, including his Feastables chocolate company. He enjoys walking down chocolate aisles in retailers, observing merchandising, and analyzing competitors' sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He even has a vendor license for Walmart, allowing him to restock his products himself if they're out of stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He finds this "therapeutic" and uses it to observe the product on shelves and understand consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### 3. Rule of 100
This is a foundational principle for [[building_an_audience_and_content_creation|content creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>:
*   "Your first videos not going to get views. Period. Your make 100 videos improve something every time on the 100th one then ask questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   He emphasizes learning through failure and continuously improving by "Point 1% better" over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   His own early thumbnails were "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, and at his 100th video, he only had 730 subscribers, many of whom he gained by asking people on Xbox Live to subscribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Most people fail because they aren't obsessed with *improving everything*, not just one specific aspect like jokes or camera quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Every single element of a video, from coloring to how long it is, can be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### 4. You Can Make Anything Viral
[[storytelling_and_its_role_in_content_creation|The power of an idea]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. He highlights that the same amount of effort can yield vastly different results based on the idea's virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. For instance, spending seven days buried alive garnered hundreds of millions of views, while laying in a bathtub for seven days would attract no attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

He demonstrates this by brainstorming viral ideas with a $10,000 budget:
*   **Grandmother**: "Completing a 100-year-old's bucket list," especially if the grandmother is terminally ill, to create a highly emotional and impactful video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Drawing**: Ideas include "drawing the world's largest picture" (though too expensive), customizing phones, or finding people on the street to sketch them in a comically ugly way, which often goes viral on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. He also suggests designing a hospital floor for Make-A-Wish kids with cool artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### 5. Creative Process and Collaboration
While [[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]] used to generate all ideas himself, he now has teams and focuses on the "back 10%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. To generate great ideas, he emphasizes surrounding himself with "other very creative people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. His core team includes individuals skilled in specific areas like thumbnails, titles, and overall creative inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This mirrors the [[creative_process_and_collaboration_in_content_creation|creative process and collaboration]] described at Pixar, where the focus is on taking something that "sucks" and "removing suck" through iterative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

### 6. Impossible is Possible / No Doesn't Mean No
[[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]] challenges the notion of impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. When his team members claim something is impossible, he pushes them to explain "why" and identify the specific costs or problems, rather than accepting a simple "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. He uses examples like wanting to film at the Eiffel Tower or the Pyramids of Egypt; his response to "not possible" is to ask who told them that and to make more calls to higher authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. He believes that if he had listened to people telling him things weren't possible, he wouldn't have achieved half of what he has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This mindset is vital for innovation and pushing boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

He references Elon Musk's approach to moving rockets by road, where physics are the only true laws, and everything else is a suggestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. Solving "impossible" problems often requires a "caveman" or lower-level approach, and relies on having people who genuinely love problem-solving and see challenges as exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. An early example of this philosophy was his video where he cut a table in half with a plastic knife, an idea born from boredom and simple calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### 7. Consultants are Cheat Codes
[[opportunities_in_content_creator_partnerships|MrBeast]] believes in leveraging experienced people as "cheat codes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. His "production bible" states:
> "Need to make the world's largest slice of cake? Start off by calling the person who has made the previous world's largest slice of cake. LOL he's already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work. I really want to drill this point home because I'm a massive believer in Consultants... always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

He applies this by calling experts like David Blaine (for his buried alive video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a> or simply flipping through his phone contacts and asking people, "Teach me something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of adding value back to these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

### 8. Block out the Noise
[[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]] notes that when he was starting, people called him "obsessed," a "weirdo," and told him to "get a life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Now that he's successful, these same qualities are admired as "drive" and "tenacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. He states that if you have to "block out a lot of noise," it's a signal that you're "not around the right people" and need to change your environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### 9. Reinvest Everything
A cornerstone of his [[business_models_of_successful_youtube_creators|business model]] is reinvesting almost all profits back into his content, often to "comical extents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. His mentality is akin to Mark Zuckerberg's early Facebook decision or Walt Disney's compulsion to put all money back into making better shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. He views this as a "kamikaze level of commitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. His motivation is not about keeping money, but about making the "best product possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. He aims to constantly "dial back less" on his ambitions as more money becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.

## Business Expansion and Ethical Sourcing (Feastables)
[[mrbeasts_work_ethic_and_routine|MrBeast]]'s Feastables chocolate company aims to be the largest ethically sourced chocolate company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He was angered to learn that 46% of cocoa labor in West Africa (where 70% of the world's cocoa comes from) involves illegal child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. Companies told him it was "not that simple" to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>, reinforcing his "impossible is possible" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

He consulted with ethically sourced chocolate companies like Tony's Chocolonely to learn their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. The core issue is poverty, with farmers making less than a dollar a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Feastables pays 100% of its farmers a "living income" based on a reference price that considers local cost of living and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. All beans are fair trade certified, and they work with the Child Labor Remediation System (CLRM) to audit farms, interview families, and ensure children are attending school and not involved in illegal labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. They also provide coaches to help farms increase yield and occasionally supply tools like wheelbarrows to improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. His goal is to demonstrate that it's possible to be profitable while operating ethically at scale, using his platform to challenge unethical practices in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

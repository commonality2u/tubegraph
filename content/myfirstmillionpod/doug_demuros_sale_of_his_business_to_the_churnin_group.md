Doug DeMuro, a prominent automotive YouTuber and journalist, sold a majority stake in his car auction website, Cars & Bids, to the Churnin Group for an estimated $40 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This acquisition marked a significant milestone in DeMuro's career, transitioning his content-led business into a substantial asset.

## Doug DeMuro's Journey to Entrepreneurship

Before founding Cars & Bids, Doug DeMuro was primarily known for his work as a journalist and, later, a successful YouTuber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His [[doug_demuros_journey_from_journalist_to_youtube_car_reviewer | journey from journalist to YouTube car reviewer]] began by writing funny, quirky blogs for various websites, including Jalopnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He parlayed this into a YouTube channel, which now boasts over four million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. DeMuro's appeal stems from his relatable, funny, and quirky personality, often highlighted by his unique sense of style and focus on the "quirks and features" of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

His [[doug_demuros_approach_to_growing_his_youtube_channel | approach to growing his YouTube channel]] involved minimal strategy, focusing instead on delivering high-quality content filled with information about cars, rather than prioritizing high-end production value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He transitioned from reviewing his own cars to doing reviews of other people's cars in 2017, which significantly reduced financial risk and allowed for more frequent video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This shift helped the channel "really take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. DeMuro also introduced the "Doug Score," a personal rating system for cars that, despite its unpolished, Google Sheet-based format, became a valuable tool for his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

While his YouTube channel generated significant income, DeMuro expressed constant fear that the revenue "tap" could turn off at any moment due to the volatile nature of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This anxiety about the long-term job security of a creator-led business motivated him to launch a more stable venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Founding Cars & Bids

DeMuro's desire to diversify and build a more enduring business led him to found Cars & Bids in June 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The idea emerged from observing the market for online car auctions, particularly the success of Bring a Trailer, but also recognizing its deficiencies, such as slow listing times and dated website functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Cars & Bids aimed to be a modern auction site focusing on cars from the 1980s and up, catering to a younger, more millennial audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

DeMuro, not being a "tech person," partnered with Blake, a viewer with a tech background whom he met through a casual dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. They used seed money from Blake's company to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The equity split was a point of contention, but DeMuro secured a substantial majority because he brought the crucial element: an existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Many other auction sites had launched and failed because they lacked this built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

The launch was chaotic, with the team unprepared for the immediate surge in listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. An initial promotion offering $1,000 for the first 50 cars and $500 for the next 50 led to thousands of submissions, which DeMuro personally had to approve or deny initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The business model charges buyers a 4.5% fee, while sellers pay nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Cars & Bids also generates revenue from shipping and inspection services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. In 2021, the company achieved around $75 million in gross sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## The Sale to the Churnin Group

The sale of Cars & Bids to the Churnin Group in 2021 was a result of sustained interest from private equity and venture capital firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. The Churnin Group was particularly persistent and reached out through a mutual friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. A key factor in DeMuro's decision was the Churnin Group's specialization in [[scaling_business_through_acquisition_and_partnerships | creator-led businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. DeMuro's primary fear was that an investment firm would try to alter his successful YouTube content and overall persona, something he believed he could manage better himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. The Churnin Group's understanding and respect for his established brand and audience were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

The negotiation was complex, with DeMuro relying heavily on his partner, Blake, who had previous experience in the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. The deal involved selling a majority stake for approximately $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This valuation implies a total business valuation in the $60-$80 million range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

The sale provided DeMuro with significant financial comfort, allowing him to "chill a little bit" and make better decisions for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. He used some of the proceeds to buy a Porsche Carrera GT, a dream car for many enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. DeMuro reflected that the wealth allowed him to detach from the constant "grinding for the next video" and provided peace of mind, especially with the birth of his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The [[business acquisition strategies | business acquisition strategy]] employed by the Churnin Group, focusing on creator-led ventures, carries inherent risks. DeMuro himself acknowledges the "crazy business model" where massive investments are made into businesses tied to individual creators who could potentially "go off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. However, the benefit lies in not needing to spend heavily on paid marketing due to the engaged existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

With Bring a Trailer's previous sale to Hearst and its subsequent growth, DeMuro believes there's a clear pathway for Cars & Bids to achieve a multi-billion dollar valuation, potentially reaching $500 million or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. He continues to advise other content creators to [[building_and_selling_successful_companies | start businesses]], leveraging their audience before it potentially diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. The internet's evolution has made online auction sites a significant and growing part of the car market, offering amplified reach for sellers and wider selection for buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

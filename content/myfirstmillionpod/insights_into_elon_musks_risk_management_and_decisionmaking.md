Jason Fried, co-founder of 37signals, shared his perspective on [[Elon Musks risk management and decisionmaking | Elon Musk]] after reading his biography, finding inspiration in the business aspects of his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Fried believes that the term "reckless," often used to describe Musk's actions, is inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Instead, he views what appears risky as a form of [[taking_calculated_risks_with_people_and_investments | risk reduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

## Contrasting Approaches to Risk

Fried suggests that traditional Corporate America often takes a riskier route due to fear, marginal decision-making, and complexity, leading to "mediocrity slathered in marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. He distinguishes between different types of mistakes:
*   **Worst Mistakes** occur from slow decisions, committees diluting responsibility, sloppy cost controls, and demanding pseudo-certainty before acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   **Musk's Mistakes** are real and have consequences, but they are "rooted in Forward Motion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

Fried admires Musk for being unafraid to make these types of mistakes, showcasing what's possible when one "pierce[s] the membrane that holds most things back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

## Principles of Musk's Decision-Making

According to Fried, many examples in [[Elon Musks risk management and decisionmaking | Elon Musk]]'s biography highlight his focus on:
*   **Simplifying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>
*   **Cutting out waste** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>
*   **Getting to the root of things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>
*   **Figuring out what really matters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>
*   **Avoiding preoccupation with external opinions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>
*   **Not being constrained by perceived limitations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>

### The SpaceX Rocket Example
Fried recounts an example from the biography involving a SpaceX rocket launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. When a crack was found in the skirt surrounding an engine, a typical response from organizations like NASA would be a multi-month delay and a rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

In contrast, [[Elon Musks risk management and decisionmaking | Elon Musk]]'s response demonstrated a different approach:
*   He immediately asked if the crack could be *removed* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   Upon learning that removing it would result in some propulsion loss, he asked for the precise amount of loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   When informed that the system had sufficient margin to tolerate this loss, he instructed them to cut the crack out and proceed with the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

The launch was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. Fried interprets this as "common sense fundamental smart problem solving," rather than recklessness, as it averted other risks, prevented time loss, and avoided other potential issues that could arise during a prolonged delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

Jason Cohen, a successful entrepreneur behind companies like Smart Bear and WP Engine, shares insights into identifying business opportunities, leveraging new technologies, and the realities of building successful companies.

## The Opportunity in Presentation and Communication

A core insight is that often, it's not bad information, but rather bad presentation that hinders success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Zeec.app: An Example of Addressing Presentation Issues
Actor Ed Norton co-founded Zeec.app, a company aimed at reimagining how CEOs collaborate with their boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Norton's motivation stemmed from observing that companies he invested in were "horrible at telling me back the story" and giving effective presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. His goal was to create software to help companies improve their storytelling and make meetings more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Key Principles for Effective Presentations
The main problem with most presentations isn't fancy slides, but a jumbled and unclear message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. To improve a presentation, ask key questions:
*   What is the number one takeaway for the audience? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> This should be the title of the first slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Titles should convey the *message* you want them to take from a slide, not just label what's on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For example, instead of "Our Team," a title could be "Our team has had three successful exits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Improved Communication
AI can be used not just to provide answers, but to ask clarifying questions that help users think about a topic more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. For instance, an AI could prompt users with questions like:
*   "What's an area I really know about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   "What's a thing that I really believe in?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   "Am I looking for something short-term or long-term?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

Another approach is to use AI to generate the "bland neutral summary" of a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This then helps identify what *not* to say, encouraging the development of more unique and interesting content by focusing on what isn't generic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This approach could be developed into a [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities | multi-step AI process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Business Strategy: Selling Value Over Time or Cost Savings

Customers often don't truly value their time and may do "crazy things to save $2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. When developing and positioning a product, it's more effective to sell value rather than just saving time or cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

For example, a product that halves the cost of marketing leads could be marketed as:
*   "Halves your cost" (saving money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>
*   "Double your leads" (generating value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>

While both descriptions refer to the same product, customers are typically willing to pay a much higher percentage for a product that *doubles leads* (potentially 100% more), compared to one that *halves costs* (perhaps only 25% of savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The focus should be on generating as much value as possible for the customer, then deciding how to split that value with them, whether through price, higher retention, or advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Realities of Building Companies

### All Startups are "Screwed Up"
Every startup has its problems, even the successful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The difference is that successful companies have one or two things they are "excellent at," which allows them to overcome numerous other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Entrepreneurs tend to focus on their own problems, while external perceptions of successful companies are often "varnished" and overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

Successful companies like Twitter, despite multi-year public failures in keeping their site up, thrived because a core idea was so compelling that it overshadowed their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Strategic Problem Solving
Given that every business has problems, the key is to identify the one or two critical problems that are truly holding the business back, hindering growth, or causing customer cancellations, and then focus resources on those specific issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This strategic focus is crucial whether you are a solo entrepreneur or running a large company like WP Engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### The Evolution from Startup to Scale-Up
Starting a company involves doing "as many jobs as possible" to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. However, scaling up requires shedding as many jobs as possible to ensure continued survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. The actions that lead to product-market fit are often the wrong actions to take when scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>; a company must mature and cannot operate in perpetual chaos with a thousand people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

### Optionality as Power
Building a good company provides optionality, which is power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. This means having the ability to:
*   Sell (at good terms, but not being forced to) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>
*   Raise more money (at good terms, but not being forced to) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>
*   Go public (but not being forced to) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>

This optionality is achieved by building a company that is growing, profitable, has happy employees who stay, and satisfied customers who advocate for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### The "Freedom Line"
Jason Cohen discusses the concept of a "freedom line," which is the amount of money where one gains "the freedom to work on any project I want for the rest of my life while simultaneously providing for my family, never again worrying about bills, debt, having a place to sleep or sending my daughter to any college she wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. While the exact number varies by individual goals and location, for a "rich lifestyle" in the US, it's considered to be around $20 million in 2023-2024, to account for taxes, inflation, and maintaining a balanced portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding one's personal goals is crucial, as the goal might not be to "never work again," but rather to gain enough capital to self-fund future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. "Play your game," and do not adopt others' goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

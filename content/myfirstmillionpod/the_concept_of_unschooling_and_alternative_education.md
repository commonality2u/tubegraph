## Introduction
Jack Smith, an entrepreneur known for selling his company Vungle for $800 million at 29, is also recognized for his [[unconventional_life_choices_and_experiments | interesting and unconventional life choices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He has a philosophy that includes questioning norms and avoiding being told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. This mindset extends to his views on education, leading him to explore and advocate for alternative educational models like unschooling for his own child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

## What is Unschooling?
Unschooling is an educational philosophy where there is no set curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. Instead, the child learns whatever they want to learn, focusing on what is useful or interesting to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. This contrasts with traditional homeschooling, which often tries to replicate the standard school curriculum, including tests and subjects like math and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Jack believes that exams and rigid structures can "ruin the fun and curiosity of learning skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples
Jack references a book called "Don't Tell Me I Can't," written by a 14-year-old boy who was unschooled from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>.
*   **Early Self-Sufficiency**: From around five to seven years old, this child was repairing his family's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurial Endeavors**: He started his own business by buying a small piece of land, raising animals, and selling produce locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. Later, he bought a rundown house, repaired it, and flipped it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. By age 13, he managed hundreds of acres of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>.
*   **Practical Learning**: While his friends complained about learning irrelevant facts like the names of planets in alphabetical order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>, he was learning about pass-through LLCs and C Corps for tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. He even loaned money to his parents and bought their car to help them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.
*   **Billionaire's Approach**: Jack notes that figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have created their own schools for their children, suggesting that even billionaires believe the traditional school system is "f***ed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

## The Role of Curiosity and Practical Learning
The unschooling philosophy emphasizes that learning occurs when there's a need to acquire a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. For example, the boy in the book learned math not from abstract theorems but because he needed it to do his taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.

Jack envisions an educational environment where kids pick topics they are interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. He suggests inviting experts, like a friend skilled in copywriting, to give lessons to the class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. He believes many professionals would be willing to teach a curious 10-year-old who shows initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

Another alternative model is "Forest School," which is essentially playing all day in a forest, engaging with nature and practical activities like making mud pies or orange juice from picked oranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. Jack's sister runs a similar school called "Nature Kids," where children are outside, learning about things that interest them as they explore trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>. These children often have more energy than those in traditional schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>. This approach encourages self-driven learning and avoids associating learning with boredom or being forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While acknowledging the benefits, Jack and the hosts discuss potential challenges:
*   **Lack of Drive**: What if a child isn't naturally self-driven or curious enough to pursue knowledge like flipping houses or understanding complex financial structures? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>
*   **Professional Credentials**: How would unschooling prepare a child for professions requiring specific credentials, like a doctor or lawyer? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> Jack suggests that one might need to hire tutors or accelerate learning in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.
*   **Societal Norms**: Jack's decision to name his daughter "Baby" for the first 12 months to get to know her before choosing a permanent name, a deviation from the requirement to name a baby before leaving the hospital, highlights his rejection of societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. He even had a "naming ceremony" where the baby picked her own name by crawling towards different options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. This approach aims to give his daughter an interesting fact about herself and foster a unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

## Jack's Personal Approach to Parenting and Education
Jack doesn't plan to send his daughter to school or college, believing that universities may not exist in their current form in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. He plans to create his own educational environment for his daughter, potentially starting with a version of "Forest School" adapted for older children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>. His goal is to ensure she has fun while learning and to foster her natural curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

He highlights the importance of asking "why" and questioning established norms, as he did with the baby naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. This [[the_approach_to_deciding_whats_next_in_life_and_career | approach to life]] allows for the discovery of alternative methods that can be more beneficial or align better with personal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. The shift in education, particularly with the advent of AI, opens up new possibilities for [[future_of_education_and_credentialing | learning and credentialing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>.

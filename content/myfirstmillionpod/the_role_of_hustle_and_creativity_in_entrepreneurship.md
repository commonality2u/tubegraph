Sarah Moore, a figure previously unknown to the public and lacking social media presence, has emerged as a compelling example of [[importance_of_hustle_in_career | hustle and creativity]] in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Despite having no money or experience, she successfully acquired and grew a multi-million dollar business, eggcartons.com, purely through sheer determination and unconventional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Her story illustrates that [[entrepreneurship_and_early_success | success]] is often less about pedigree and more about willpower and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## An Unconventional Start
Sarah Moore's journey is marked by an extraordinary background that fueled her drive. Coming from a difficult upbringing with no parents and a history of being in and out of jail, she found a turning point when a family took her in and taught her fundamental life lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. She admits to paying her sister to take the SAT for her to get into college, and then "hustled her way through college" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. This early experience instilled in her a profound fear of disappointing those who believed in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

Her path to business school was also unique; despite lacking traditional academic strengths (she noted her intelligence was "below average" and her reading level was 33% when she started college), a mentor recognized her natural inclination for business and encouraged her to pursue it, emphasizing that business allowed for a greater impact than other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

## Creative Business Search Strategies
Upon hearing about "search funds" – a concept where one can acquire an existing business and become CEO with little to no money or experience – Sarah realized this path was "very appealing" to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Lacking the financial background typically associated with business acquisitions, she decided to go it alone, seeing it as an opportunity to gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

Her search process was characterized by resourceful and unconventional tactics:
*   **Leveraging Free Resources** She utilized a smart friend from business school to scrape a database of private companies within a 90-minute radius of her Boston apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.
*   **Hiring Unconventional Interns** She found her best interns on Craigslist, preferring them over "cookie cutter" students from job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>. She attracted them by offering a "private equity experience" with full transparency, allowing them to listen in on calls with owners, brokers, and attorneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>. She even obtained fake IDs for them to access the Harvard library for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.
*   **Mass Outreach with a Personal Touch** Recognizing the low response rate from targeted emails, she shifted to a high-volume email strategy. She guessed email combinations using common patterns and sent generic emails that appeared personalized, stating she was looking for a business fitting specific revenue and profitability criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. This tactic made recipients believe she had done extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.
*   **"Industry is Overrated"** Contrary to conventional wisdom, she quickly realized that the industry of a business was "absolutely irrelevant." Her focus became finding an "established and consistently profitable" business, discarding rigid industry filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>.

## Innovative Acquisition and Growth
Sarah acquired eggcartons.com, a multi-million dollar business, with "all debt" and "no money in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Her key strategies for acquisition and subsequent growth included:
*   **Seller's Note Financing** A non-negotiable for her was a seller's note, where the seller finances a portion of the purchase price over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:37">[03:09:37]</a>. She secured a 25% seller's note and a 75% bank note, finding banks that viewed the seller's note as equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This required approaching over 20 banks to find the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Communication** She avoided jargon like "EBITDA" and used simple terms like "income" when discussing financials with sellers, which she believes helped build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Redefining the Business** Initially, she thought she was in the "egg industry" but quickly realized, by analyzing customer order history, that she was in "specialty packaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Forty percent of the business's revenue came from non-egg related products, such as packaging for crickets, bath bombs, and cupcakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>. Her new mantra: "anything requiring protection and separation is fair game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This insight allowed for significant growth, especially during COVID-19, when the business experienced 5-6x growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Play to Your Strengths** Recognizing her limitations (not handy, not tech-savvy), she sought a simple business she could "walk into and day one more or less get it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.
*   **Delayed Changes** A key lesson learned was "do not change anything big or really anything at all the first year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. A seemingly simple change to the phone system caused a week-long outage and customer concerns, highlighting the importance of understanding existing operations before making major changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## The [[Entrepreneurial mindset and societal shifts | Entrepreneurial Mindset]]: Don't Count Yourself Out
Sarah Moore's story embodies the idea that [[the_role_of_persistence_and_grit_in_business_success | persistence and grit]] are paramount. She emphasizes that anyone who "wants to buy and operate a small business can do so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Her strategies to "increase her luck" and proactively seek opportunities included:
*   **Leveraging Identity as an Advantage** As a woman in a male-dominated broker community, she intentionally stood out at events by wearing high heels and loud colors, making herself memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Publicizing Her Intentions** She wore a sweatshirt that read "I want to buy your business" with her phone number on the back, and even included her picture in mass faxes sent to potential sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. This audacious approach ensured maximum visibility in an untapped channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Do it for the Story"** She operates with a mentality that "nothing is off limits," embracing even seemingly "dumb" ideas as part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. This commitment signals to herself and her team that they are "all in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

Sarah believes that her humble beginnings provided her with skills not taught in formal education, enabling her to "pull herself up by [her] bootstraps and make [her] life what [she] want[s] it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-11:13:00>[01:13:00]</a>. Her experience is a powerful testament to [[entrepreneurial_success_stories | entrepreneurial success stories]] achieved through sheer will and unconventional ingenuity. Her biggest fear is disappointing those who believed in her, which keeps her motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

For more insights into her journey, Sarah plans to share information through a Q&A format due to overwhelming inquiry volume, encouraging interested individuals to use a provided form for communication rather than contacting her directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. She hopes to empower others to pursue entrepreneurship as a path to freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.

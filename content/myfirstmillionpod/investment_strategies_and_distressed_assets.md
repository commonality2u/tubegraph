Distressed assets represent, for some, the most profitable [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | asset class]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This sector involves companies or assets that are in financial trouble, often undergoing bankruptcy or facing severe economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Philosophy of Distressed Investing

A core philosophy in distressed investing is that the "sexier an investment, the lower the returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Unlike "sexy" venture capital, distressed investing is often described as "ugly" and "complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It "reeks of death everywhere" because it deals with companies that didn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The market often discounts these assets heavily, sometimes to pennies on the dollar, implying they might be worth nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Despite the unappealing nature, distressed assets have yielded the speaker's best returns, excluding companies he founded himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The key is to [[investment_strategies_and_reflections_by_andrew_wilkinson | invest]] in the "unsexy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Strategies and Tactics

Investing in distressed assets typically involves:

*   **Reading Bankruptcy Filings** A crucial first step is to meticulously review public bankruptcy filings, which list all assets and claims against a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Buying Claims Against Bankrupt Companies** One can purchase claims from creditors who are owed money by the bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This requires diligence to verify ownership and legally transfer the claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Brokers specializing in these claims can facilitate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Bringing Companies Out of Bankruptcy** This involves partnering with experts in distressed credit to either acquire claims or actively participate in reorganizing and reviving a bankrupt company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Consolidation and Cost Cutting** In declining industries, acquiring multiple smaller distressed companies, consolidating operations, and aggressively cutting costs can lead to cash flow positive outcomes, even if revenue declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Case Studies in Distressed Investing

### FTX Bankruptcy Claims

When [[the_impact_of_bankruptcy_filings_on_investment_opportunities | FTX went bankrupt]], there were approximately $8 billion in claims against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A key asset identified in the bankruptcy filing was FTX's $500 million investment in Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Estimating Anthropic's valuation at $40 billion, the Anthropic stake was believed to be worth around $4 billion, suggesting creditors might recover 50 cents on the dollar from this asset alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Claims against FTX were available for 22 cents on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The speaker invested $2.2 million to buy $10 million worth of claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This was done through a broker, Thomas Brazelle, who made a market in these claims and performed diligence to ensure legitimate transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
Ultimately, a surge in crypto prices led to an expected return of 160 cents on the dollar, turning the $2.5 million investment into a projected $15 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Enjoy (Vape Company)

Enjoy, an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) company, had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The speaker's interest stemmed from friends who successfully used Enjoy to quit smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
Partnering with Jason Mudrick of Mudrick Capital, a distressed credit shop, they acquired the company out of bankruptcy for a valuation of $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This was viewed as a "regulatory play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Unlike competitors like Juul, Enjoy focused on smoking cessation for adult smokers and avoided marketing to youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
Despite public concerns over vaping, Enjoy invested heavily in seeking FDA approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. After five to seven years and significant investment, they secured regulatory approval and sold the company to Altria for approximately $2.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This resulted in a 30x return on investment, turning $2.5 million into $75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### Dex Media (Yellow Pages)

Dex Media was a Yellow Pages company generating $600 million in revenue and $280 million in EBITDA but declining by 12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The investment strategy involved acquiring other Yellow Pages companies (e.g., in Canada, Australia) at low multiples (two to three times EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. By cutting costs faster than the revenue decline through consolidation and retaining top salespeople, the business remained cash flow positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
The management team also successfully transitioned the company from a Yellow Pages business to a CRM software company, leveraging its relationships with small and medium-sized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. This investment yielded a four or five-fold return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Distressed investing, while "unsexy" and complex, has proven to be the most lucrative [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | asset class]] for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It requires deep diligence, patience through significant volatility, and often involves navigating complex regulatory or legal landscapes. The principle that "the sexier an investment, the lower the returns" guides this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.# Investment Strategies and Distressed Assets

## [[finding_unique_business_niches | Finding Unique Business Niches]]

A powerful strategy for [[ecommerce_business_ideas | ecommerce business ideas]] and [[leveraging_internet_platforms_for_business_growth | leveraging internet platforms for business growth]] is to identify high-volume search queries that are currently answered by "listicles" (long articles with ranked lists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. This concept is termed "your listicle is my opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>. The goal is to collect and refine data to provide a more user-friendly, structured experience than a simple article.

For example, searching for "healthiest fast food" or "healthiest cheese" yields significant monthly search volume (e.g., "healthiest cereal" has 50,000 searches/month; "healthiest bread" has 30,000/month; "healthiest cheese" has 20,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>. Despite the high volume, the keyword difficulty for many of these terms is not very high, suggesting an underserved market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>.

A potential business opportunity in this niche could be:
*   Creating a TikTok page that quickly compares fast-food items (e.g., "Craving a chicken sandwich? Don't eat the Popeye's one because... eat the Chick-fil-A one because...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>.
*   Directing viewers to a Wirecutter-style website for more detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>.
*   Monetizing through affiliate marketing and brand advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>.
*   Using tools like Ahrefs to find hundreds of related "healthiest X" keywords, which can then be targeted for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:37:00">[42:37:00]</a>.

## Conclusion on Niche Businesses

The success of these companies highlights the [[importance_of_deep_knowledge_in_a_niche | importance of deep knowledge in a niche]] and the power of solo founders who are not constrained by traditional business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. By doing "the whole stack" – marketing, design, and development – and being creative in their approach, they can build highly profitable businesses by solving specific, overlooked problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.

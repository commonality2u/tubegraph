Modern marketing is characterized by its rapid evolution and the strategic leveraging of new platforms to influence consumer behavior. The current landscape offers significant opportunities, particularly on platforms like TikTok, which are likened to the early days of Facebook for their cost-effective reach and direct sales potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Key Elements of Modern Marketing

### The Power of TikTok
TikTok is currently a highly lucrative platform for businesses due to the vast amount of money available for creators and brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It functions similarly to Facebook in the 2012-2014 era, offering very cheap traffic and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

#### The Creator Method
A primary strategy on TikTok is the "Creator Method," where brands incentivize TikTok creators to promote products. This involves offering creators a kickback on sales and additional rewards for hitting monthly sales targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Example: Goalie Gummies** – This brand offers a tiered rewards program for creators, including iPads for $1,500 in sales, iPhones for $4,000, all-inclusive trips to Aruba for $15,000, Rolexes for $50,000, Miami condos for $1 million, and even Lamborghinis for higher targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Some creators have already achieved these high targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Monetization for Creators** – Creators can earn substantial income, with some being put on retainer for $10,000-$30,000 a month to create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Halo Effect** – Direct sales from TikTok videos create a "halo effect," where increased awareness leads to better performance for paid ads and higher search rankings on platforms like Amazon and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

#### Financial Advantages
One significant benefit of this model for businesses is the cash flow perspective. Unlike traditional advertising where capital is risked upfront for ads, the TikTok creator model often involves only sending free product to affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Payment for the ad is only made once a sale is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This model is particularly effective for [[marketing_strategies that drive consumer behavior | digital products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Understanding Consumer Psychology
[[Understanding and leveraging consumer psychology in marketing | Consumer psychology]] plays a crucial role in modern [[marketing_strategies that drive consumer behavior | marketing strategies]].

#### Leveraging Core Desires
Products that tap into core human desires, especially those that are visual in nature and can show "before and after" results, tend to perform well due to their high-margin potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Beauty Products** – Examples include "Botox face tape" for those curious about Botox but unwilling to commit to the cost or extremity of injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Hair Color** – Brands like Madison Reed successfully built an empire using online-first distribution via Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. A new "Madison Reed" could thrive on TikTok by showcasing ease of application, less mess, or gentler chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Health and Wellness Trends** – Products like apple cider vinegar gummies (Goalie) or red light therapy capitalize on health trends, even if scientific effectiveness is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Self-Help Products** – The "Shadow Work Journal" sold over 100,000 copies on TikTok by appealing to audiences interested in therapy, horoscopes, and the mystic self with emotional and relatable quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

#### Classic Marketing Hooks Reimagined
Timeless marketing hooks continue to be effective across different media, including TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Curiosity Gap** – Techniques like the "curiosity gap" (e.g., "you're not going to believe number seven") are highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. This is seen in TikTok videos where creators tease shocking lines from books or transformative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Sensory Overload** – Products that engage multiple senses, like "candy candles" designed to look and feel like edible treats, capture attention and drive desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **MLM Product Categories** – Analyzing successful Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) product categories (e.g., candles, essential oils) can identify products with strong consumer desire that can be successfully marketed without the MLM structure, using new distribution engines like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **DNA Testing and Personalization** – Products like 23andMe or ancestry/food sensitivity tests, despite scientific debates on efficacy, appeal to curiosity and personal insights, making them strong candidates for this marketing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.

### Strategic Considerations for Success
*   **Speed and Adaptability**: Modern marketing platforms like TikTok require brands to be agile, as trends and effectiveness can change quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Identifying categories where traditional incumbents are not yet leveraging these new platforms creates significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Repeat Purchase Value**: The most crucial variable for long-term success is repeat purchases. Consumable products (like hair color or candles) or those requiring ongoing use (like Botox treatments) are ideal, as they build a sustainable customer base without constantly needing new customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Products purchased only once, like mattresses, make it harder to sustain long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Audience-Platform Fit**: Aligning the product and marketing strategy with the audience and native content style of the platform is key. For example, a 25-year-old creator's style may resonate more with TikTok's demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

> [00:41:54] "Amazon... got big on the back of Google and it worked because they were like we're going to use this to make ourselves huge and also we know that the customer is always first so we have to provide the best customer service with the best product."

Ultimately, combining rapid growth strategies with a strong focus on customer experience and repeat purchases can lead to significant success in modern marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

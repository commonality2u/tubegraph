Cody Sanchez joins as a guest host to offer business ideas for the women's market, identifying opportunities that men might overlook due to less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These ideas are described as "blind spots for men but that the women will understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Traditional Wife (Trad Wife) Movement
The traditional wife (Trad Wife) movement is identified as a significant behavioral phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Cody Sanchez first observed this trend on Instagram, seeing a woman in a flowy dress with a child, captioned, "girl boss question mark I want to be a hobbit mama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This resonated with the post-COVID desire to be a "gentleman farmer" and is seen as its "2.0 version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. TikTok views for "tradwife" reached 187 million, indicating a massive trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

This movement is perceived as a counterculture to the "Call Her Daddy" phenomenon, which emphasizes sex positivity and female empowerment in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. While "Call Her Daddy" has seen its podcast ranking decrease, the Trad Wife movement suggests a pendulum swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The discussion highlights three perceived categories for women:
1.  **Sex-Positive Relationship Empowerment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
2.  **Career Work Empowerment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
3.  **Traditional Values** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

People often float between these categories depending on their life phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The existence of a belief or behavior that "can't be said" often presents a business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Examples include Donald Trump capitalizing on unspoken thoughts and Grinder enabling non-traditional dating behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Snapchat also emerged as an opposite reaction to the public and permanent nature of Facebook and Instagram, allowing for ephemeral, silly content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

This "pendulum swing" is also visible in physical appearance trends, such as the Kardashians shifting from promoting curvy body types (leading to growth in cosmetology and men's spas) to now removing fillers and Brazilian butt lifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Consumer Trend Opportunities

### Hobby Lobby/HomeGoods 2.0
An observed opportunity lies in improving the retail experience of craft and home goods stores like Hobby Lobby and HomeGoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Current State:** Hobby Lobby, a crafting store, does $7 billion a year in sales despite its "gnarly CVS" aesthetic with fluorescent lights and cluttered aisles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. TJ Maxx and HomeGoods have a combined entity of $51 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Behavior:** Women often love a "discount on a HomeGoods item," viewing it as a treasure hunt experience to find deals like a "vase and a vas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This physical "deal hunting" aspect makes these stores resilient against online competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **The Opportunity:** Create a "Hobby Lobby 2.0" or "HomeGoods 2.0" that "churches up" the shopping experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Joanna Gaines' Magnolia, which successfully disrupted dead industries like magazines and built a strong retail and e-commerce presence, serves as an example of a "Disneyland for middle-aged white women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Models:**
    *   A West Elm Local model, featuring cool, limited-edition popup Etsy shops from local providers within a larger store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   Partnering with existing stores for themed pop-ups (e.g., a Christian-themed pop-up at Hobby Lobby) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
    *   Transforming a house into a staged shopping experience where items can be ordered for home delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Key Insight:** Customers want to leave with the physical item immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. A common "hack" is to take an upset wife to HomeGoods to buy candles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

### The Seasonal Pop-Up Business Model (Halloween Express)
Halloween Express operates similarly to Spirit Halloween, popping up in vacant spaces for about 60 days before Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Structure:** Stores are typically 10,000 sq ft within larger retail spaces, using temporary drapes and racks for quick, cheap setup (like "Ikea furniture of stores") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. A full store can be built out in days or weeks, compared to months or a year for normal retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
*   **Financials:** Cody attempted to buy a Halloween Express business for $600,000, including 3-4 retail locations and last year's inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The claimed revenue for these three locations was around $1 million, with claimed margins of 30-45% (though 10-20% is more typical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This model suggests a potential break-even within 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Inventory cost is around $200,000-$250,000, with $50,000-$100,000 needed for new concepts annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

### Fantasy Werewolf Romance Novels
The romance novel industry is a massive market, with $1.3 billion in sales per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. Fantasy romance, particularly involving werewolves, is identified as the biggest growing category within this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. This trend is popular with an audience aged 18-45, shifting from the traditional "long-haired Fabio" covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. Best-selling books like Harry Potter, Twilight, and 50 Shades of Gray show a morphing of these genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

Sam Parr (Cody's co-host) previously commissioned a ghost-written romance novel to demonstrate how to become an "Amazon bestseller" by targeting niche categories and selling many copies at a low price for a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. The 50 Shades of Gray series famously started as a Twilight fanfiction on Wattpad before being re-branded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### The Fertility/Pregnancy Market
Getting pregnant is often described as "hard" and "expensive" today, with a convoluted, frustrating process involving doctors and tracking apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
*   **Current Issues:** Existing solutions like the Mea egg-shaped fertility tester are criticized for poor user experience, lack of gamification, and high cost (e.g., $50 for sticks, $150-$200 for the device) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Market Value:** The **[[Health conscious consumer trends | fertility and pregnancy market]]** is extremely valuable, with women becoming price-insensitive once they are ready to have a baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. The ability to identify when a woman is pregnant (high purchasing intent) and sell data to medical providers or offer affiliate deals presents significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.
*   **Existing Success:** Flo.Health, a period tracking app, is a billion-dollar company with over 300 million downloads and over $100 million in annual recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **New Ideas:**
    *   **"Bedside Egg" Device:** A smart device that glows to indicate fertility window, adding romance to the clinical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
    *   **Adoption Concierge Service:** A company focused on helping gay male couples adopt babies. This demographic often has high household incomes and is willing to pay for solutions to a "convoluted low NPS process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Similar to H1B visa concierge services, a consulting model could offer high-ticket services for complex, high-desire workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
    *   **Women's Health Solutions:** Inspired by male-focused health companies like Homoe Health (which provides TRT), there's an underserved market in women's health. Many dieting and health trends are normalized by men (e.g., Tim Ferris and keto), but don't work the same for women due to biological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.

### Life Partner Hack: Flowers
A "life partner hack" from a woman to a man is a monthly flower subscription for your wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Flowers are a high ROI, low pain point gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. Women generally like plants and flowers, possibly as a pre-genetic disposition or a societal influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. For some, having fresh flowers in the house daily was a childhood aspiration, symbolizing wealth and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. Even if on subscription, the gesture is appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

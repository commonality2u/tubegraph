Many are not prepared for the scale of transformation that is about to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## AI's Transformative Power

**AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> has "opened everything up," particularly with large language models [[generative_ai_and_its_potential_impact | large language models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Automation of Knowledge Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>: Almost any task performed by a knowledge worker, especially those with an IQ of 130 or below, can potentially be replicated perfectly by software with no management overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[the_impact_of_ai_on_job_automation | job automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Practical Applications in Business** [[utilizing_ai_in_daily_business_operations | Utilizing AI in daily business operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>:
    *   Creating prototype websites without coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   Writing website copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   Analyzing large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Shift in Skillset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>: The need to "learn to code" is diminishing; instead, it will be more important to effectively communicate with and instruct virtual developers, essentially "talking to this pretty smart entity" that will perform tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **AI as a Sparring Partner** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>: **AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> can serve as an effective brainstorming partner for business problems, offering surprisingly good solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Evolution of Business Models with AI

The concept of "Capital as a Service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> is becoming feasible with **AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Automated Due Diligence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>: Companies could connect their metrics, Stripe, bank, and QuickBooks accounts, allowing a large language model (LLM) to perform diligence and automatically disburse funds if certain bars are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional, high-touch VC processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **AI as a Human Agent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>: There's an emergent trend where humans act as agents for **AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, receiving prompts from the **AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> and executing its ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. An example cited is a person who generated $20,000 in monthly revenue for a content website by letting ChatGPT guide them on creation and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Future Trends and Market Disruption

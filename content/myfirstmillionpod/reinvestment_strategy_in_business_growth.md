MrBeast attributes his unique approach to business growth and success to an aggressive [[investment_strategies_and_experiences | reinvestment strategy]], where he puts nearly all earnings back into his ventures, particularly YouTube content and his companies like Feastables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

## "Reinvest Everything" Mentality

MrBeast employs what has been described as a "kamikaze level of commitment" to reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. His approach involves taking all the money earned and investing it back into the channel, along with all available hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. He actively seeks out top talent and inspires them to share this investment mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

This commitment means that if the business made $100,000 in a month, the goal would be to invest $101,000 the following month, even if it means incurring a loss on a large streaming deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. His motivation is not wealth accumulation but the relentless pursuit of creating the best possible product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

> "I don't think this guy's gonna like get rich and retire like every other YouTuber...that's like a kamikaze level of commitment like I I don't think that's... what do you do with somebody who's willing to just like allow it all back in like that's a that's not the person I would want to compete against" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>

### Historical Parallels

This philosophy draws parallels to other visionary entrepreneurs:
*   **Mark Zuckerberg**: When offered $1 billion for Facebook early on, Zuckerberg famously stated that if he took the money, he would simply start a new social media platform because he liked the one he already had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. This illustrates a primary focus on the product and mission over personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Walt Disney**: Walt Disney was known for his "compulsion" to reinvest all earnings back into making better shows, with his brother Roy often pulling his hair out over the lack of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. This reflects a deep commitment to product quality over financial accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

### Application of Reinvestment in Business

MrBeast's reinvestment strategy is not just about YouTube videos; it extends to his business ventures, like Feastables chocolate. He explicitly states his ambition to make Feastables the largest ethically sourced chocolate company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

His investment in Feastables is driven by a desire to address child labor in the cocoa industry, a problem he believes major chocolate companies dismiss due to profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

> "Elon's putting like gonna put people on Mars and you're telling me we can't not have little kids farming or chocolate we can't just find people over the age of 18 or whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>

To achieve this ethical sourcing, his reinvestment goes towards:
*   **Paying a Living Income**: 100% of Feastables farmers are paid a living income, based on a reference price that considers the cost of living in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. This directly combats poverty, which is the root cause of child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
*   **Fair Trade Certification**: All beans are fair trade certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Child Labor Remediation System (CLRMS)**: Feastables works with CLRMS to routinely audit farms, interview parents and children, and follow up to remove children from illegal child labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Farmer Support**: Providing coaches to represent farms, educating them on increasing yield, and giving tools like wheelbarrows to improve efficiency and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

The goal is to demonstrate that it's possible to be profitable at scale while operating ethically, providing a model that can challenge existing industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

## Early Stages of Reinvestment

In the early days, when MrBeast was starting out, his extreme reinvestment strategy was viewed by others, including his mother, as "deranged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. He recounts receiving a $10,000 brand deal and immediately wiring it to a random person on the street for a video, rather than keeping any for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. This early commitment set the precedent for his future operations and his willingness to always "dial back less" on his ambitious video ideas as more money became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.

This approach demonstrates a fundamental belief that the value lies in the continued growth and improvement of the product or service, constantly pushing boundaries and leveraging resources to achieve unprecedented results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

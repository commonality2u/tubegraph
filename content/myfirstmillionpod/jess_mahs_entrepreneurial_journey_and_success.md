Jess Mah is a highly successful entrepreneur recognized by industry leaders like Paul Graham and Sam Altman as one of the most impressive entrepreneurs in the world [00:00:30]. Despite her significant achievements, with approximately 10 companies combined valued at $950 million, she maintains a low public profile and rarely gives interviews [00:00:17], [00:00:35].

## Early Life and [[entrepreneurship_and_early_success | Early Entrepreneurship]]

Jess Mah describes her early school years as challenging, feeling like a "loser amongst losers" [00:01:06]. She was bullied even within her high school's computer club, struggled with grades, and felt that traditional schooling was not for her [00:01:14], [00:01:18], [00:44:26]. She eventually dropped out of high school halfway through her sophomore year [00:01:22], [00:44:11].

At the age of 13, Mah began her first business venture: a dedicated server and collocation business [00:42:54]. Initially, her goal was to earn around $10,000 annually to cover her video game server expenses and buy clothes [00:43:17]. This [[early_entrepreneurship_and_diverse_business_ventures | early entrepreneurship]] quickly grew, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue per year [00:01:31], [00:43:04], [00:41:19]. She humorously recalls making more money than her biology teacher at the time [00:45:51].

Her experiences seeking advice from successful entrepreneurs like Justin Khan (co-founder of Twitch) and Mark Benoff (Salesforce) while still a teenager [00:41:17] instilled in her the mindset that she didn't need to wait or have prior success to start [00:46:44], [00:46:49].

## Transition to a Holding Company Model

Mah's first major company was Indinero, a financial SaaS company offering accounting, tax, and bill management software and services to businesses like Slack, Pinterest, DoorDash, Instacart, and Coinbase [00:09:14], [00:09:17], [00:09:24]. She started Indinero right after studying computer science at UC Berkeley [00:09:31], [00:09:32].

Unlike many Silicon Valley startups, Indinero was built without significant traditional venture funding, allowing Mah to retain most of the ownership [00:10:02], [00:10:07], [00:10:11]. It grew to a few hundred employees with a valuation in the hundreds of millions and remains a cash-flowing, profitable business [00:09:56], [00:09:59], [00:10:18]. Despite its success, the business faced multiple near-death experiences due to being undercapitalized and operating close to the edge [00:10:27], [00:10:32].

Initially, Mah believed she had to be the CEO and grow a company to unicorn status to be considered successful, a common Silicon Valley rhetoric [00:10:50], [00:10:57]. However, after researching billionaires, she realized that many built their wealth through diversified holding companies, often holding onto businesses for decades, and were not necessarily the CEO or operator but rather investment managers [00:11:07], [00:11:11], [00:11:21]. This realization shifted her perspective.

A significant personal tragedy—the unexpected death of her boyfriend—led Mah to a period of deep depression where she was unable to work [00:11:43], [00:11:51]. This experience prompted a profound self-reflection: "What would I do if I was going to die this year... what would I do if I wasn't scared of failure?" [00:12:08], [00:13:14]. Running a company was not on that list [00:12:17].

This pivotal moment led her to hire CEOs for Indinero and another litigation fintech company she had started [00:12:19], [00:12:22]. This allowed her to transition to a more non-operational role, focusing on new ventures through a personal "manifestation studio" or holding company [00:58:53], [01:17:58].

## Bold Science and Biotech Ventures

Mah's holding company model focuses on "bold science" ventures, distinguishing itself from typical small-scale holdco models [00:07:45], [00:07:51], [00:13:08]. These are projects that aim for non-incremental, large-scale changes, often by taking radically different approaches to complex problems [00:36:16], [00:36:27].

Despite getting a C-minus in biology in high school [00:02:04], [00:18:57], she now runs a nine-figure biotech company [00:02:08]. Her approach involves hiring biology tutors, consuming vast amounts of information, and collaborating with leading scientists and experienced biotech operators [00:19:07], [00:20:16], [00:20:20], [00:20:25], [00:32:33].

One significant area of focus is [[success_stories_and_lessons_in_entrepreneurship | bioelectricity]], a field championed by scientist Mike Levin. Levin's research suggests that bioelectricity, not just genetics, dictates factors like lifespan, cancer development, and body shape [01:13:46], [01:13:53]. Mah learned that manipulating bioelectric signatures can produce unusual biological outputs, such as growing an eyeball with spinal cord connection on a different part of an animal's body without genetic modification [01:15:05], [01:15:31], [01:15:41].

Mah's holding company helps commercialize this research. When Mike Levin's lab funding dried up after Paul Allen's passing, Mah stepped in [01:16:06], [01:16:10]. She hired Tom, a drug developer with a track record of gaining FDA approval for a drug with only $16 million (compared to hundreds of millions typically needed), to conduct due diligence and strategize commercialization [01:17:05], [01:17:08], [01:17:18].

Under this biotech holding company, several ventures are being built:
*   **Sju:** A company focused on overcoming drug resistance in cancer treatments, addressing instances where effective drugs suddenly stop working for patients [01:18:23], [01:18:30].
*   **Anthrobots:** A company developing programmable human biobots, a topic that has garnered attention in scientific publications like Nature [01:19:08], [01:19:14], [01:19:18].

Mah is also excited about future possibilities like extending human lifespan by 30% to 120 years or more [01:34:02], [01:34:06] and the potential for artificial embryo generation, where an embryo could be grown in a lab using only genetic material (no sperm or egg), a concept that could become viable in the next 5-10 years [01:33:04], [01:33:09], [01:33:53], [01:34:02], [01:34:06], [01:34:40], [01:34:45], [01:34:47].

## "Billionaire Secrets" and Mindset

Mah shares insights into the mindset and practices of highly successful individuals:

*   **"Get on the Plane" Approach:** Mah emphasizes the importance of proactively meeting people in person, even if it requires significant travel. She calls it the "ultimate 10 out of 10 way to engage with someone," far more effective than calls or Zoom [00:36:42], [00:36:53], [00:37:11], [00:37:37], [00:39:57], [00:40:01]. She even uses her private jet for quick meetings [00:37:25], [00:37:26]. This willingness to go the extra mile creates a powerful impression and reinforces the perception of "destiny for greatness" [00:38:09], [00:38:11], [01:09:35], [01:09:50].
*   **Tax Optimization:** Billionaires prioritize top-tier tax optimization, understanding that efficiently managing taxes significantly impacts compounding wealth [00:47:52], [00:47:54]. Mah advises seeking advice from multiple tax strategists who work with billionaires, rather than relying on a single, potentially less specialized accountant [00:48:11], [00:48:15], [00:48:28], [00:49:44]. She believes that investing 5-10% of one's time in optimizing taxes yields the highest return on investment [00:50:46], [00:51:01].
*   **Strategic Asset Acquisition:** Highly successful individuals often view expensive assets like yachts or private planes differently, often leveraging them for tax benefits. For example, a $30 million yacht purchase might offer a $30 million write-off, making it net cash flow positive, especially if largely financed and chartered out to offset operational costs [00:59:47], [00:59:50], [01:00:03], [01:00:11], [01:00:14]. Similarly, planes can provide significant first-year depreciation write-offs [01:00:26], [01:00:40], [01:00:55]. Even some exotic cars can be driven for free or at a profit due to their appreciating value and limited supply [01:01:32], [01:01:40], [01:02:03].
*   **Personal Optimization:** Mah invests in herself through multiple coaches, viewing it as essential for maintaining a clear mindset, similar to going to the gym or taking a shower [00:52:29], [00:52:33], [00:52:41]. She also participates in CEO groups like YPO (Young Presidents' Organization) for peer support and shared learning [00:52:53], [00:52:58]. She emphasizes optimizing health through nutrition, nootropics, and IVs (like exosome IVs) to boost mental acuity, energy, and longevity, viewing the cost as a highly effective investment in her productive capacity [00:53:18], [00:53:23], [00:53:31], [00:53:35], [00:53:58], [00:55:02], [00:55:09].
*   **Learning and Synthesis:** Paul Graham's advice highlighted that successful people are not just intelligent but possess grit, are unconventional, and can collect ideas from diverse fields to synthesize groundbreaking solutions that domain experts might miss [01:09:01], [01:09:09], [01:09:15], [01:10:18]. This broad learning, even about seemingly unrelated topics, enhances one's ability to be an effective advisor and generate new ideas [01:11:24], [01:12:15].

Jess Mah believes that people should pursue their aspirations without waiting, as life priorities change and opportunities can be lost [00:25:51], [00:26:22]. She encourages individuals to see success in others as inspiration rather than a source of bitterness [01:04:55], [01:06:01], [01:06:17]. Her journey exemplifies a shift from traditional [[entrepreneurial_success_stories | entrepreneurial success stories]] focused on profit maximization to a mission-oriented approach, where making money serves the purpose of funding audacious, world-changing endeavors [01:21:09], [01:21:19], [01:21:29], [01:21:34].

The Van Trump Report, a daily newsletter focused on farming and agriculture, has grown into a massive business with an impressive revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The newsletter is known for its high-value, niche content, and unique approach to distribution and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[01:49:49]</a>.

## Origin and Growth
The idea for the newsletter stemmed from Kevin's background in commodity trading, particularly in grains like corn, beans, and wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. His expertise was in translating complex Wall Street concepts into understandable language for farmers and vice-versa for traders who didn't understand the Midwest agricultural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

In 2007, he began journaling as a way to become a better trader and investor, and started sending these notes to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. These notes started circulating, even reaching individuals at major trading firms like Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. This organic spread led him to consider charging for the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Initially, he decided to charge $40 a month, comparing it to a "storage unit deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. The business "took off and went nuts" from there, growing entirely organically without any advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. The newsletter now reaches about 45 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This exemplifies a strong case for [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch]] and navigating [[the_early_struggles_and_strategies_of_starting_a_newsletter]].

## Business Model and Reach
The Van Trump Report is a daily newsletter that provides agricultural-based information for farmers, commodity traders, and even politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. It's read by Congressmen, Senators, and large hedge fund groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>.

Key figures include:
*   **Subscribers:** Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 paid subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** While some early subscribers were grandfathered in at $40/month, the standard rate is $600 per year, which increased to $660 about eight years prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. Some businesses also white-label the report for their staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** At 30,000 subscribers paying $600 a year, the newsletter generates roughly $18 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   **Team:** The core team is lean, primarily consisting of Kevin, a content assistant named Stacy, a friend (former golf pro), a school buddy, his son Jordan, and his wife handling bookkeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Kevin still personally writes the market commentary and stories, with Stacy assisting on other content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. This hands-on approach contributes to [[building_a_personal_brand_for_business_growth]].

## Content and Style
The newsletter's style is informal and direct, written in the same manner Kevin speaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. Beyond market commentary and insights on agricultural commodities, it also notably includes about five pages of memes, which adds a unique and entertaining element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.

## Inspiration for Others
The success and business model of the Van Trump Report directly inspired others, including the creation of "Milk Road," a crypto newsletter that was later sold for millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This highlights the effectiveness of Kevin's model in [[building_and_selling_successful_businesses]].

## Related Ventures and Philosophy
While the newsletter is the primary business, Kevin also runs the "Farm Con" conference, which started as a small gathering of friends and traders and grew significantly, selling out its capacity and hotel every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. His son, Jordan, runs a related swag company ("A Swag") primarily serving the agriculture world, which is projected to do $25-30 million this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

Kevin's business philosophy emphasizes taking revenue from the newsletter and investing it into various other ventures, including AgTech and biotech startups, real estate (commercial, single-family, and farmland), and even fractally invested farms through companies like Acre Trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. This strategy focuses on diversifying wealth and leveraging knowledge gained from the agricultural sector.

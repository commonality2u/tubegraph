Cars and Bids is an online auction platform specializing in enthusiast cars from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Founded by popular YouTube car reviewer Doug DeMuro, the company rapidly grew and was sold to The Churnin Group for approximately $40 million within two to three years of its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Origin Story
Doug DeMuro, a journalist turned YouTuber with millions of subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, conceived the idea for Cars and Bids out of a personal concern about the longevity of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. He believed that content creators needed to [[Building successful businesses from scratch | start businesses]] because audiences might eventually fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

The opportunity arose when a viewer named Blake, who had a background in tech, emailed Doug and later met him in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. After hearing about Blake's experience selling a car on a competitor's platform and recognizing its deficiencies, Doug proposed the idea for Cars and Bids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Seed money from Blake's company helped get the venture off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Doug secured a substantial majority ownership because he brought the crucial audience to the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Business Model and Early Growth
Cars and Bids operates as an auction site for cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Its primary business model involves sellers paying nothing, while buyers pay a 4.5% fee on the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Additional revenue streams include a shipping component and inspection services, which have been shown to increase bids and sale prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Doug's YouTube channel content revenue is also now integrated into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

The platform launched in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, with operations initially managed from Doug's back patio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. To incentivize early sellers, Cars and Bids offered $1,000 for the first 50 cars listed and $500 for the next 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This strategy generated immense immediate interest, leading to a thousand submissions on the first day, creating "absolute chaos" and unexpected success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Doug personally approved or denied all initial car submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The company quickly became profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, achieving $75 million in gross sales in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## Competitive Landscape
Cars and Bids entered a market with an established player, Bring a Trailer, which was significantly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Doug and his partner recognized some dissatisfaction with Bring a Trailer, noting its massive size led to longer listing times and functional issues with its WordPress-based platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Their strategy was to offer a modern website focused on a more modern audience (cars from the 1980s and up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

Many other auction sites launched and failed to compete, largely due to a lack of audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. The success of Cars and Bids highlighted the crucial role of a pre-existing audience in [[Building and Selling Successful Companies | building and selling successful companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Acquisition by The Churnin Group
The company attracted numerous inquiries from private equity and venture capital firms, especially as the car market boomed and Bring a Trailer was acquired by Hearst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Cars and Bids initially ignored these offers, feeling too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. However, The Churnin Group was persistent and gained an introduction through a mutual friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

A key factor in the deal was The Churnin Group's specialization in "creator-led businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This understanding alleviated Doug's fear that investors would interfere with his YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. The negotiation process, which took six to eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>, led to The Churnin Group acquiring a majority stake for approximately $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Doug took some money off the table, allowing him to purchase his dream car, a Carrera GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. He noted that having financial security has made him more relaxed and enables better decision-making for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Doug believes there is a clear pathway for Cars and Bids to reach a valuation of $500 million or more, drawing parallels to Bring a Trailer's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. He highlights that online auction sites for cars provide significant value by amplifying sellers' reach and offering buyers a broader selection than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The market for online car sales is growing, and these platforms are becoming the "new way" to buy and sell vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.

### Creator-Led Businesses
Doug emphasizes the importance of content creators [[Building and Selling Successful Companies | building and selling successful companies]] and brands, advising his peers to leverage their audiences while they last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. He notes that while some creators may find it challenging to add a business venture to their already busy schedules, it is essential for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

The model of private equity investing in creator-led businesses like Cars and Bids is seen as "crazy" by Doug due to the inherent risk of the creator's personality being central to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. However, he acknowledges that such investments provide benefits, such as reduced marketing costs due to the built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

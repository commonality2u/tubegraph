The question of "what's next" in life and career can be paralyzing, especially for individuals with a track record of success, as it often comes with the pressure for the next endeavor to be equally significant [00:00:57]. However, the approach to this decision doesn't necessarily require grand, immediate leaps.

## Embracing Small Steps and Experiments

Instead of aiming for monumental shifts, it can be beneficial to start with small, manageable experiments. For example, a successful podcast that now spans ten years began as a commitment to just six episodes [00:01:21]. This approach aligns with the philosophy of Seth Godin, who suggests that big dreams are "easy to hide behind" [00:01:50], while the "smallest thing possible" — the next action — serves as a clear pass/fail test, making accountability immediate and tangible [00:01:54].

### A Menu of Possibilities
A practical first step is to create a "menu" of things one would like to try or learn [00:02:57]. This list can include diverse activities, from learning a new skill, such as prototyping board games with a game designer [00:03:09], to pursuing less obvious or "weird" interests [00:03:34].

## Prioritizing "Weird" and Long-Term Value

Embracing "weird" ideas can be a significant advantage, as these unorthodox pursuits often mean less competition and a greater likelihood of possessing natural enthusiasm and endurance for the activity [00:04:39].

The primary criteria for choosing projects should be their potential for long-term success, even if they appear to fail in the short term [00:05:32]. This means selecting endeavors that help develop or deepen durable relationships and skills [00:05:50]. These accumulated relationships and skills tend to "snowball" over time, ultimately leading to success [00:06:01]. This forms a core aspect of [[personal_development_and_growth]].

## Energy as Currency

A crucial filter for evaluating potential next steps is considering the energy exchange: Does this activity provide more energy or substantially less [00:06:30]? Engaging in seemingly "frivolous" activities like archery can be akin to "plugging your phone into the wall," recharging your overall energy reserves that can then be applied to other areas of life [00:06:49]. The goal is to leave interactions and projects feeling more energized than drained [00:07:42].

## Designing the "Perfect Tuesday"

Instead of solely focusing on grand "peak experiences" that are few and far between, consider designing a "dream average day" [00:08:13]. Much of life consists of "normal Tuesdays" [00:08:31], and intentionally shaping these routine days to include fulfilling activities like physical exercise, productive work, family time, and creative outlets is vital for overall satisfaction [00:08:51].

For example, a highly successful individual, despite having immense resources, noted a lack of time for creativity, feeling as though sketching might be a "waste of time" [00:09:03]. Maintaining a "creative gym" or outlet, whether it's playing drums, drawing, or practicing Jiu-Jitsu, is critical for sustained peak professional performance, fostering [[personal_development_and_financial_independence]] through improvisation, experimentation, and present-state awareness [00:11:37].

## Shifting from Optimization to Effectiveness

While optimization has its place, an excessive focus can lead to applying efficiency to every aspect of life, even when it's not appropriate [00:16:13]. Tim Ferriss, for instance, has become "less focused on optimization" in his daily life [00:15:55]. Instead, the emphasis should be on effectiveness—doing the right things—rather than merely efficiency—doing things right [00:19:23]. Effectiveness focuses on "what you do," while efficiency is "how you do any given thing" [00:19:35]. As author Tony Robbins puts it, "majoring in minor things" is not a great way to go [00:19:50].

Being comfortable with not being busy is also important, as rushing into commitments out of discomfort can lead to taking on projects that consume years without alignment with long-term goals [00:20:56]. This relates to the principle of having tight constraints and not breaking your own rules, similar to effective [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups]] [00:21:37]. Indiscriminate action, driven by the need to be busy, can be a "dangerous form of laziness" [00:22:29].

## The Barbell Approach

The "barbell approach," borrowed from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's investing philosophy, suggests having very high-risk, high-upside ventures balanced with very low-risk, secure foundations, with nothing in between [00:43:51]. This can be applied to various aspects of life:

*   **Projects:** Pursue highly experimental projects (e.g., a podcast with no video) alongside more traditional, high-quality endeavors (e.g., cinematic video productions), avoiding middling efforts [00:44:40].
*   **Networking:** Instead of constant, draining Zoom calls, opt for either quick, low-obligation texts or dedicated, in-person full-day interactions [00:46:08].
*   **Speaking Engagements:** Choose between free engagements where the audience or event is highly appealing (potentially even paying to be there) or ultra-premium, high-paying opportunities [00:46:40]. This strategy maximizes margin for error and allows for greater experimentation [00:47:58].

## Asking Powerful Questions

To navigate the "what's next" dilemma, asking powerful questions can be a "pickaxe for the brain" to "dig the gold out" [00:53:54].

Some key questions to ask oneself:

*   **"What would this look like if it was easy?"** This question helps reframe challenges and identify simpler paths [00:54:15]. For instance, making an interview easy involves being genuinely enthusiastic and aiming to provide provocative insights to the guest [00:54:30].
*   **"Am I leaning into my absolute strengths and unfair advantage as much as I could be?"** This prompts reflection on one's "superpowers" and how to maximize their application [00:56:16]. Examples of unfair advantages include the ability to ask unusual or "dumb" questions, learn quickly, and deconstruct complex subjects [00:57:17].
*   **"What is the silly story I'm telling myself?"** We often create fictional barriers or excuses. Identifying these "silly stories" allows for interrogation and replacement with more empowering narratives, akin to facing fears by making them ridiculous [00:59:53].
*   **"Don't believe everything you think."** This billboard-worthy advice from a hospice care physician highlights the importance of constantly cross-examining one's own beliefs, as not all thoughts are inherently true [01:01:52]. This is crucial for [[overcoming_personal_and_career_setbacks]].

These questions and approaches, including the disciplined application of positive constraints in decision-making, underscore a philosophy of intentionality and continuous learning, which can help navigate complex career and life choices.

Guy Spear, an investor who has spent 25 years studying the likes of [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] and Charlie Munger, emphasizes the importance of learning from the greats in any field [00:00:36]. His journey highlights how developing a strong personal and professional network can significantly impact success and personal growth.

## The "Posy" Study Group

Spear's interest in [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] and value investing led him to engage with other like-minded individuals in New York City [00:01:42]. He became involved with a group known as "the Posy," which was formed by Whitney Tilson, described as a "Master Networker" [00:02:04]. Tilson, who attended Harvard Business School a year apart from Spear, introduced him to other people who shared a fascination with [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] and a desire to become better investors [00:02:10]. The group, comprising five or six members, would meet regularly, sometimes even once a week, in one of their offices [00:02:30].

The Posy's meetings had a structured element: members would present a written stock idea for in-depth discussion [00:03:57]. However, the most valuable insights often came from the "unstructured" discussions, where casual mentions or conversations sparked new ideas [00:05:01]. Spear noted that this "meta information" was often the most fascinating takeaway [00:05:37].

Spear initially didn't fully grasp the power of such a group, comparing it to business school study groups [00:02:57]. It was only after a dinner with Monish Pabrai, who spoke about YPO forums, that Spear realized the profound impact of these collaborative environments [00:03:01]. The Posy met for two to four years and maintained an email chain, with some members becoming very close friends [00:03:22].

## Lessons from Networking and Collaboration

### The Farmer Mac Incident

A significant learning experience for Spear came from a discussion within the Posy regarding Farmer Mac [00:05:42]. Having invested in Freddy Mac and Fanny May, and seeing their success as government-sponsored enterprises in the mortgage market, Spear identified Farmer Mac as a similar, albeit smaller, opportunity in farm loans [00:06:48]. He presented this idea to the Posy, believing it to be "the next Freddy Mac and Fanny May" [00:09:05].

However, Whitney Tilson informed him that Bill Ackman was considering or had taken a massive short position in Farmer Mac, viewing the company as "borderline fraudulent" [00:09:34]. Spear, recognizing Ackman's expertise, immediately sought a meeting to understand his analysis [00:10:14]. Ackman had meticulously downloaded and analyzed public filings, revealing that unlike typical mortgage-backed securities with thousands of diverse small mortgages, Farmer Mac's offerings contained only a few large "business loans" that lacked proper risk distribution [00:11:06].

Spear admitted he had not done this deep level of analysis [00:10:56]. Confronted with Ackman's detailed findings, Spear realized his oversight and promptly sold his position in Farmer Mac [00:13:09]. A subsequent meeting with Farmer Mac's management, where they struggled to answer Ackman's pointed questions, further affirmed the depth of Ackman's due diligence [00:14:06]. This experience underscored the critical importance of thorough analysis and learning from those with deeper expertise [00:15:10].

### Learning from Deep-Diving Mentors

Spear recounts a personal experience where a friend, acting as a mentor, provided invaluable insight by deeply analyzing his e-commerce business [00:15:26]. The friend performed a thorough audit of the website and ad accounts, delivering a two-page document of "hyper tactical observations" on issues and opportunities [00:16:06]. This depth of analysis, exceeding Spear's own, served as an "eye opener" on how truly "best people operate" â€“ by drilling "right in to the source of the issue" [00:16:56]. Spear noted this as an "extraordinary act of generosity," given without agenda, driven by care and expertise [00:17:35].

### Self-Improvement and the Power of Giving

Spear's journey also involved significant personal "rewiring," partly inspired by Tony Robbins [01:00:01]. He attended multiple Tony Robbins seminars, including a pivotal "firewalk" experience, which dramatically shifted his perspective on the extraordinary things humans can achieve with the right mindset and physiology [00:21:21]. This shift helped him overcome early career frustrations and an arrogant attitude of being "smarter than most people" [00:22:21].

A key lesson from this self-improvement path was the power of "giving" [00:18:23]. Spear realized that performing positive actions can change one's internal state.

### The Impact of Handwritten Notes and Reciprocation

Inspired by Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People* and Robert Cialdini's *Psychology of Influence*, Spear adopted the practice of writing personalized handwritten notes [00:30:07]. He committed to writing at least three notes a day, based on the idea that people respond positively to being acknowledged by their name and receiving expressions of appreciation [00:31:19].

Initially, Spear admits he was "faking it," going "through the motions" [00:32:28]. However, he soon discovered that "the act of writing the note changed my insides, made me care about them a little more" [00:33:39]. This aligns with Tony Robbins' teaching that "you don't have to feel it to do it, do it and you'll feel it later" [00:33:50]. This practice helped Spear to train his "reticular activating system" (a part of the brain that filters information based on focus) to actively look for things to appreciate in others, leading to him becoming "a more caring interested person" [00:34:43].

This simple act of generosity, born out of a desire for success and a willingness to "look like a fool," became a powerful tool for [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | network building]] [00:32:21].

### Emulating the Greats

Even [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] himself engages in similar acts of relationship-building. Spear shared that Buffett sends him personalized holiday cards with handwritten notes, demonstrating his understanding of "reciprocation" and the importance of showing care for individuals, even those seemingly insignificant to him [00:37:07]. Similarly, Kobe Bryant was known for remembering personal details about people and making them feel special, understanding the long-term impact of a brief, positive interaction [00:40:56].

### The "What Would X Do?" Framework

A core tenet of Spear's approach, influenced by [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] and Monish Pabrai, is the practice of modeling success [00:51:07]. Since he couldn't have [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] as a direct mentor, Spear would ask himself, "If he was my mentor, what would he say?" and "If [[guy_spears_approach_to_value_investing_and_warren_buffetts_influence | Warren Buffett]] was here right now, if he was in my shoes, what would he do?" [00:51:57]. This "unbelievably powerful question" guides his actions and decision-making.

This concept extends to a broader life philosophy, encapsulated by the "Two Gas Stations" metaphor, often attributed to Monish Pabrai [00:53:01]. The story describes two gas stations across the street, one thriving by consistently implementing small, positive actions (like washing windshields, making prices slightly cheaper) while the other, seeing these actions, fails to copy them [00:53:22]. Spear realized that he, too, was often "the guy on the other side of the road," failing to copy the simple, effective strategies employed by successful individuals like Pabrai [00:54:28]. This led him to focus on breaking down successful actions into "repeatable steps" and building "engines" to scale them, such as his Value X event for generating goodwill [00:55:27].

## Investing and Life as an Infinite Game

Spear emphasizes that investing, like life, is an "infinite game" [01:08:02]. Unlike a "finite game" with clear rules, boundaries, and winners/losers (e.g., chess or football), an infinite game has no defined end, and players aim to keep playing [01:06:33]. The mistake many make is treating life or investing as a finite game, leading to short-term thinking and self-destructive behavior [01:07:57].

Spear's long-term outperformance against the S&P 500, despite periods of underperformance, is maintained by focusing on "compounding" and making moves that enable long-term growth, rather than jeopardizing it for short-term wins [01:05:54].

Spear also highlights the "just this once" fallacy, where people make isolated, poor decisions without considering their cumulative long-term impact if repeated [01:10:46]. He advocates for asking: "If every time I'm faced with these circumstances, I say yes to this, how will my life look?" or "If everybody in the world did this contemplated thing... what would the world look like?" [01:11:12]. This helps simplify decisions and align actions with long-term goals and a desirable future [01:11:22].

Finally, Spear suggests a flexible approach to learning, treating one's library like a "cocktail party," where one can "mix and mingle and hop from one conversation to the other," abandoning books that don't immediately resonate [01:16:31]. This "iterating quickly" approach ensures that reading time is spent on material that genuinely provides "win after win after win" [01:16:20].

Guy Spear's journey underscores the profound impact of intentional [[the_influence_of_business_education_and_networking | networking]], continuous self-improvement, and a long-term mindset rooted in observational learning and deliberate practice.

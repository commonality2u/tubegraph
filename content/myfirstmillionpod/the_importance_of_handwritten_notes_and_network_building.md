The journey to success in investing and life often involves [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | building strong relationships]] and adopting effective personal practices. Guy Spier highlights the profound impact of [[importance_of_handwritten_thankyou_notes | handwritten notes]] and strategic [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | network building]] as key elements in his own development and success.

## The Power of Handwritten Notes

Guy Spier emphasizes the transformative power of [[importance_of_handwritten_thankyou_notes | handwritten notes]], a practice he adopted after encountering it in Robert Cialdini's book, *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The book recounts the story of the most successful car salesperson who achieved this by writing thousands of cards a year, essentially saying "I like you" to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.

Spier adapted this concept to "thank you" notes, committing to writing at least three notes daily before leaving his office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. This discipline was a way of demonstrating his desperate desire for success, being willing to try things he hadn't before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Despite initial skepticism from peers, he persevered, unafraid of "looking like a fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

A crucial insight from this practice was that the act of writing the note changed his internal state, making him genuinely care more about the people he was writing to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. This illustrates the principle of "doing it and you'll feel it later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This aligns with the concept of the reticular activating system (RAS), which trains the brain to notice things it's looking for, thereby making a person more interested and grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

### Noteworthy Examples
*   **Warren Buffett:** Spier reveals that [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | Warren Buffett]] himself practices this by sending personalized holiday cards to people like Spier, demonstrating that he "freaking understands this stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. These gestures, though seemingly small, create a significant impact and foster a sense of connection, leveraging the principle of reciprocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
*   **Kobe Bryant:** Similarly, [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | Kobe Bryant]] was known for remembering personal details about people and making seemingly small, thoughtful gestures like calling a trainer's mom on her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Kobe viewed these brief interactions as investments that would lead to people positively sharing their experience with thousands of others over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

## Building a Strong Network

Spier's experience highlights the critical role of [[building_a_strong_personal_and_professional_network | building a strong personal and professional network]]. He describes how he sought out people who knew what they were doing in investing to "reverse engineer" their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### The Posy Study Group
A pivotal example of [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | network building]] for Spier was his involvement in "the Posy," a study group formed by Whitney Tilson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This group consisted of five or six individuals fascinated by [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | Warren Buffett]] and eager to improve their investing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Structure and Benefits:** They met regularly, sometimes weekly, to present and deeply discuss written stock ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These meetings led to follow-up business and social interactions, such as visiting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Critically, many of the "best ideas" and "meta information" emerged from the unstructured discussions within the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others:** An important lesson from the Posy involved his investment in Farmer Mac. Spier had a long position in the company, believing it to be similar to successful government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, through the group, Whitney Tilson connected him with Bill Ackman, who had taken a massive short position in Farmer Mac due to its borderline fraudulent nature, not truly being a mortgage-backed security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Ackman's detailed analysis, which revealed only a few large, risky business loans within the securities instead of many diversified mortgages, exposed Spier's lack of in-depth due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Spier immediately sold his shares, learning a crucial lesson about rigorous analysis and the value of diverse perspectives within a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Strategic Networking
Spier emphasizes the importance of [[building authentic relationships | approaching interactions without an agenda]]. His first meeting with Monish Pabrai was profoundly different because he decided to approach him without any specific goal other than learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

He also highlights the concept of a "pilgrimage" â€“ consistently placing oneself in environments where desired qualities or knowledge can be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Attending the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting annually, even if not fully embracing every aspect of Buffett's life, serves as a powerful "gravitational pull" in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This regular exposure to the desired "tribe" helps to gradually align one's own habits and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

This idea of learning through emulation, or "cloning," is a deeply human trait, akin to how children learn from parents or apprentices from elders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. Spier's approach to learning investing by ordering and studying the annual reports of companies [[networking and learning from diverse industries | Warren Buffett]] invested in, even before he bought them, reflects this deep immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

Ultimately, Guy Spier's experience reinforces that [[creating_and_leveraging_luck_through_content_and_networking | building a strong network]] and cultivating intentional, positive personal habits are fundamental to sustained growth and success.

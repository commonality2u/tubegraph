Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the "single largest opportunity and biggest tech paradigm shift" seen since the internet's emergence, surpassing even the impact of mobile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Unlike mobile, which had a discreet set of use cases (e.g., camera, GPS leading to apps like Uber), generative AI is expected to impact "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Key Use Cases of Generative AI

Discussions around generative AI often focus on:
*   **Text to Text** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>: Generating written content like blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Text to Image** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>: Creating images from text descriptions using tools like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

However, a less discussed but significant use case is:
*   **Text to Code** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>: Generating code from natural language prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This enables what is called "chat UX" or chat-based user experiences for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Instead of users needing to follow step-by-step instructions (imperative model), they can describe the desired result (declarative model), and the software generates the necessary code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### The Power of Natural Language Interfaces

The core idea is that software can be used simply by knowing English (or any language) and knowing what you want to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, a user can ask ChatGPT to create a simple website or to troubleshoot issues with hosting a site, and it can provide code and detailed instructions, even for third-party products it has access to knowledge about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

The AI's ability to engage in multi-step, conversational dialogues with "memory" allows it to understand context and iteratively refine results, even correcting broken code based on error messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Furthermore, users can reverse roles and ask the AI to "interview" them to gather necessary information for a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT

OpenAI, co-founded by Sam Altman, is considered a leading candidate to become one of the most valuable companies in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The company transitioned from a non-profit research lab to a "for-profit semi-closed" company due to the immense capital required to build large language models, especially after a funding shortfall when Elon Musk withdrew his pledged support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This transition aimed to raise necessary funds while capping profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

ChatGPT rapidly gained over 100 million users in two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. A significant development is the introduction of **plugins** for ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This opens ChatGPT as an "ecosystem" rather than just a chat app, similar to how the App Store transformed the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. These plugins allow third-party developers to connect ChatGPT to external data sources and services, enabling it to perform actions like booking travel or managing CRM data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This capability effectively turns ChatGPT into an agent that can interact with other software and the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Examples

[[Utilizing AI in daily business operations | Utilizing AI in daily business operations]] is becoming increasingly relevant. For instance, in CRM software like HubSpot, generative AI can streamline report building, allowing users to simply describe the desired report in natural language instead of navigating complex tools or writing SQL queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Examples of direct application include:
*   **Website Creation**: Rapidly generating basic HTML websites and receiving troubleshooting help for hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Music Generation**: Using AI voice models (e.g., Kanye West) to transform recorded speech into songs, demonstrating its artistic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Travel Planning**: AI can generate detailed travel itineraries, recommend hotels based on preferences, and with plugins, even book flights and accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This shifts the focus from transactional tasks to solving for the entire "experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
*   **Business Operations**: Connecting to platforms like Salesforce or AirTable, AI can automate tasks like generating lists, tagging opportunities, or updating CRM data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.
*   **Personal Projects**: Darmesh, co-founder of HubSpot, developed "ChatSpot.ai" using OpenAI's APIs to automate his own routine tasks, such as accessing HubSpot analytics or looking up domain history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. This project was later adopted by HubSpot as a core initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

## Underlying Technology: Vector Embeddings

A crucial concept behind the power of generative AI, particularly in enabling semantic search and matching, is **vector embeddings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Concept**: Just as points can be described by numbers in 1D, 2D, or 3D space, any piece of content (a paragraph, a tweet) can be reduced to a point in an abstract "high-dimensional space" (e.g., 1000 dimensions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Each point is represented by a "vector," a set of numbers that captures its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **Semantic Distance**: The mathematical distance between these vectors indicates their semantic relatedness, even if they use completely different words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This is superior to traditional keyword matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   **Applications**:
    *   **Community Building**: In a community like Hampton, vector embeddings of members' shared stories or struggles could allow for finding individuals dealing with similar "founder therapy level issues," regardless of industry or geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
    *   **Dating**: Matching people based on deeper meanings in their self-descriptions, rather than just stated preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.
    *   **Fashion**: Matching clothing items based on inferred style or meaning, not just explicit attributes like color or buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Technologies like Pinecone (a vector database) are emerging to store and search these embeddings efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. The technology for building vector embedding models is accessible to "mere mortals in a weekend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## New Skills and Opportunities

The advent of large language models is creating new skills like [[Prompt engineering as a new skill in AI development | prompt engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. This involves crafting effective prompts to get the desired output from AI, similar to how software engineers speak to computers in their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. This presents a significant opportunity for individuals who are technology-minded but not necessarily software engineers, especially those skilled at describing problems or analyzing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

The current landscape offers a high chance of building something impactful, akin to the early days of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. The market for AI tools is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous startups emerging daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

## Perspectives on AI's Future

### Optimistic View
Darmesh views AI not as "human versus AI" but as "human to the AI power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. He sees it as an "amplifying force for human ability," similar to how computers, while eliminating some jobs, ultimately created more net value and new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Concerns and [[Challenges and potential of AI technology | Challenges and potential of AI technology]]
Some prominent figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman express concern about AI's potential dangers, including its misuse for harmful purposes (e.g., generating instructions for destructive acts) or the risk of uncontrolled superintelligence (AGI) that might act against human interests if optimizing for a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This has led some to take extreme preparedness measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## The "Chat" Interface as the Future

Darmesh believes that "chat as an experience as an interface is the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. He backed this conviction by personally purchasing the domain chat.com for an eight-figure sum (over $10 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. This strategic acquisition was partly to signal his belief in chat UX and gain credibility within the AI community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

Bill Gates echoed this sentiment, stating that since the shift from DOS (character-based interface) to Windows (graphical, mouse-based interface), nothing in technology has made as big an impact as the natural language interface to software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

## Darmesh's Approach to AI

Darmesh exemplifies an enthusiastic and hands-on approach to AI:
*   **Enthusiasm and Tinkering**: He maintains high enthusiasm for technology after 30 years in software, constantly tinkering with new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping and Content**: He quickly builds and launches projects like ChatSpot.ai, even if they are "dorky" in presentation, and creates content to share his learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Investments**: His substantial investment in domain names like chat.com and prompt.com (for a seven-figure sum) demonstrates his willingness to put money behind his beliefs, even without an immediate detailed plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Integrated Role**: Despite his executive position, he has crafted a role at HubSpot that allows him to explore new technologies and build, avoiding traditional management duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

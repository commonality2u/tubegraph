The end of the year, particularly December and January, are critical months for setting the tone for the subsequent 11 or 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>. Instead of traditional New Year's resolutions, a more robust process is suggested for planning a successful year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many businesses conduct year-end reviews to assess what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, but individuals often neglect this for their personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This process aims to take control and dominate the year rather than letting external forces dictate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Why a Personal Year-End Review?

Life doesn't come with an instruction manual for managing daily challenges like emails, scheduling, balancing work with family, or handling unexpected requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This process is a product of trial and error, designed to help individuals adapt and grow as their lives evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. As one gets older, creating newness becomes harder due to the comfort of routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. However, newness is vital for relationships, momentum, enthusiasm, and [[Personal Development and Growth | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The only way to guarantee new experiences is to plan for them or leave room for spontaneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Many people "play life on defense," allowing their calendars to fill up with others' requests, leading to little personal accomplishment by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Closing Out the Year: Getting "Light"

The overall theme for closing out the year is to feel "light" and shed emotional and physical baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This provides closure and a fresh start for the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

Key steps include:
*   **Decluttering the closet:** Donating clothes unworn for 12 months, especially items that are 50/50 decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The goal is to simplify choices and keep only what is liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Cleaning the desk:** Eliminating all clutter, stacks of papers, and bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Email bankruptcy:** Responding to necessary emails, filing important ones, and deleting the rest to achieve a "Net Zero" inbox by January 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This prevents playing catch-up and allows one to "attack" the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Unsubscribing and deleting apps:** Removing unwanted subscriptions and unused apps to further declutter digital life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Clearing out cars:** Ensuring vehicles are free of clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Creating new files for the new year:** Organizing physical or digital documents for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

### Expressing Gratitude: Handwritten Letters

A crucial part of closing the year is writing 20-30 handwritten letters to people who significantly impacted or helped you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This includes colleagues, suppliers, coaches, or anyone who went above and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

*   **Why handwritten letters?** They break through digital clutter, are remembered, and convey a deeper intention and "soul" than emails or texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. The effort (writing, licking the envelope, applying a stamp, mailing) conveys love and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Personal anecdote:** The speaker has been doing this for 30 years; at 23 with no money, his entire marketing strategy was writing 10 handwritten letters a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Warren Buffett himself writes thank you letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
*   **Call to action:** An experiment for listeners is to write 10 thank you notes in 20 minutes to observe the significant return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   **Receiving letters:** Keep a dedicated box for incoming letters to review at year-end, providing a powerful reminder of appreciation and a sense of [[Finding and pursuing personal purpose | mission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

## The "Blender Exercise": Identifying Areas for Improvement

To understand areas needing work, imagine a blender where you put all aspects of your life: finances, health, weight, relationships, living situation, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. After shaking it up, give your overall life a score from 1 to 10 (10 being ultimate happiness, 1 being rock bottom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

*   **Immediate clarity:** Your brain will quickly identify the two or three things that are holding your score down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. These "broken" areas, like a strained marriage or an unfulfilling job, prevent a 10/10 rating, no matter how successful other areas are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.
*   **No comparison:** The exercise is purely personal; do not compare yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.
*   **Actionable insight:** Once identified, these issues must be addressed; they won't magically improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Identifying them prevents them from compounding and making it harder to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.

## The Three-Step Planning System for a "Monster Year"

This simple three-step process, if followed, can significantly improve one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

### 1. Misogi: The Year-Defining Event

Based on an old Japanese ritual, the concept of a "Misogi" is to undertake one big, year-defining challenge or experience annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

*   **Examples:** Riding a bike across America, a rim-to-rim Grand Canyon hike, launching a book or company, running a first marathon, quitting smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Tangible accomplishment:** Provides something significant to show for the year, beyond daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Motivation and focus:** Working towards a challenging goal changes how you show up at work and home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. It provides something to look forward to, similar to how kids anticipate a ski trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Prioritization tool:** Forces you to say "no" to non-essential things to allocate time for training or preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing challenges:** The misogi might have a 50% chance of failure, but the attempt itself is valuable for [[Overcoming personal and professional challenges | personal growth]] and adventure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.
*   **Breaking down goals:** For large challenges (e.g., an Ultraman race or starting a business), break them into "digestible bites." Focus on one small, achievable step at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** A misogi does not have to be expensive. Many adventures can be found in national parks, rivers, or local areas for minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>.
*   **Redefining "winning":** As Brené Brown suggests, sometimes "winning isn't always about getting first place; sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:00">[35:26:00]</a>. This encourages bravery and action, regardless of outcome.
*   **Personalization:** Choose something that fits your interests – it doesn't have to be an endurance event. It could be mastering a skill, learning a language, or volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

### 2. Kevin's Rule: Mini-Adventures

Named after a friend, Kevin's Rule involves scheduling something non-routine for one day or one weekend every other month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.

*   **Concept:** These are smaller, exciting adventures that break routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:15]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Taking kids fishing, visiting college friends, local hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Work-life balance:** It ensures that your work-life balance doesn't suffer by making time for personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Accumulation:** Over 50 years, this can lead to 300 mini-adventures, creating an "insane life" filled with rich experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Playing offense:** This approach involves actively planning your time rather than letting your calendar be dictated by external requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.

### 3. Quarterly Winning Habits

Instead of broad New Year's resolutions, a more effective approach is to add one new "winning habit" to your life every quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

*   **Examples:** Drinking 100 ounces of water daily, never being late to a meeting, adding a 10-minute meditation practice, or doing five stretches upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.
*   **Focus:** The goal is to build winning routines, habits, and a winning mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term impact:** Layering in even one new habit each quarter can radically change your life over a five-year window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:55:00">[38:55:00]</a>. This cumulative effect can transform you into a highly effective and well-rounded individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>.

## Putting it into Practice: The Big Ass Calendar

The key to implementing this system is a large, visual, paper calendar where all 365 days are visible on one page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>.

*   **Write it down:** As soon as you know a significant event, put it on this paper calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>. Research suggests that writing down goals improves accomplishment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize big events:** Fill in all major life events first: school dates, camp dates, spring break, planned trips, weekly date nights with your spouse, and quarterly getaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>.
*   **Permission to say "no":** Once these important personal and family events are on the calendar, you have a concrete reason to decline other requests for your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:23:00">[41:23:00]</a>.
*   **"Rocks and Sand" analogy:** This strategy is akin to the classic experiment where you put the big "rocks" (major life priorities) into a jar first, then the "sand" (smaller appointments and meetings) fills in the remaining space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>. If you fill it with sand first, there's no room for the rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>.
*   **Visual roadmap:** A large calendar allows you to visually see your gaps and track progress toward your goals much more effectively than scrolling on a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.
*   **Spontaneity and planning:** While planning is crucial, being aware of and open to new adventures helps identify potential Misogis and mini-adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a "Time Rich" Life

Being "rich" extends beyond money to spiritual, social, and time richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. Prioritizing and allocating time for oneself is paramount.

*   **Personal time:** Allocate 2-3 cumulative hours per day for personal activities, such as a morning sauna, reading, a walk, or a workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:00">[45:55:00]</a>. This ensures you show up as a better parent, spouse, CEO, or employee and avoids resentment over lost personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>.
*   **"Daily Vitamins":** Identify 10 ideal daily activities that make you feel strong and accomplished (e.g., saunas, cold plunges, running, playing with kids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>. Aim to do at least two or three of these "vitamins" each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>.
*   **No wasted years:** Time is a finite resource, and it's never the "right time" to embark on an adventure; you have to *make* the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>. The window for certain experiences (like backpacking in your 20s versus 30s) is fleeting and cannot be replicated later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. Not seizing these opportunities leads to [[Regrets and personal growth | regret]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>.

By proactively planning and prioritizing these elements, individuals can build a year they are incredibly proud of, making each year an opportunity for growth and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.

Jesse Itzler is a highly successful entrepreneur known for starting multiple companies across diverse industries. He is also recognized for his fitness achievements, motivational speaking, and "will versus can" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:99">[08:49:99]</a>. Itzler emphasizes that his successes have often come from opportunities that presented themselves rather than meticulously planned business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:99">[23:53:99]</a>.

## Early Ventures: From Rapper to Jingle Mogul

Itzler grew up in New York during the 1980s when rap and hip-hop were emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:47">[03:59:47]</a>. Initially, he pursued a career as a rapper, signing with Delicious Vinyl, but was dropped shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:66">[04:27:66]</a>. This setback led him to pivot into writing jingles and theme songs for companies and sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:99">[04:45:99]</a>.

During this early period, Itzler was living in New York, often sleeping on friends' couches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:99">[05:08:99]</a>. He faced a dilemma when a music manager offered him $10,000 for 10% of everything he would ever make, essentially owning a portion of his future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. At the time, needing money to fund studio production, he was inclined to accept the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:99">[06:00:99]</a>. However, a friend's father, Lou Katz—a successful entrepreneur and second-largest shareholder of the New York Yankees—advised him against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Katz famously asked, "Will you make this business work without the 10 grand?" emphasizing the difference between "can" and "will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This philosophy became a significant theme throughout Itzler's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:99">[08:49:99]</a>.

Itzler's jingle business began with a pivotal moment: he approached the New York Knicks to write a theme song called "Don't Back Down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. The Knicks paid him $4,000 for the song, but it cost him $4,800 to produce, resulting in an initial financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:99">[15:44:99]</a>. Despite the loss, Itzler viewed it as a strategic investment, gaining the Knicks as a customer allowed him to leverage their name as a "calling card," making it easier to secure deals with other professional sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:99">[16:10:99]</a>. He built a business selling CDs of these theme songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:99">[16:30:99]</a>.

At 27, he sold this company to a public company called SFX for an initial $4 million, with an earn-out that eventually brought the total to $12-16 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. After taxes, he made around $1.5 million from the initial sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. However, due to overspending and an immature relationship with money, he eventually lost most of his initial earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.

## Marquee Jets and the "Jet Card" Concept

With the same business partner, Itzler co-founded Marquee Jets in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:99">[23:38:99]</a>. The idea for Marquee Jets arose when Itzler was a guest on a private jet and realized the potential for a new service model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:99">[23:53:99]</a>. At the time, private air travel options were limited: either buying an expensive private jet ($50 million) or committing to a fractional ownership program like NetJets, which required significant capital and a five-year commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>. Chartering also presented uncertainties regarding plane ownership and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.

Itzler identified a "white space" in the market for individuals who wanted private jet access for around 25 hours a year without the responsibilities of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:99">[25:02:99]</a>. Their solution was the "jet card"—a 25-hour pre-paid card that worked like a debit card for private jet travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.

To execute this, they needed planes. Their strategy was to partner with NetJets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:99">[25:29:99]</a>. The initial meeting with NetJets' president, Rich Santulli, resulted in them being kicked out after only 12 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:99">[26:41:99]</a>. However, their persistence paid off. Itzler had previously helped a man whose daughter wanted to be a backup singer at a famous singer's concert; this man, Jim Jacobs, turned out to be the president of NetJets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:99">[27:26:99]</a>. Jim Jacobs gave them another chance.

For their second meeting, instead of a traditional PowerPoint presentation, Itzler and his partner brought in their own "focus group" of eight potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:99">[28:57:99]</a>. These individuals, including Carl Banks from the New York Giants and Run from Run DMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:99">[29:43:99]</a>, explained why they would buy a 25-hour jet card but not a fractional ownership. This live demonstration proved more impactful than any chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:99">[29:09:99]</a>. Santulli saw their enthusiasm and was willing to "bet on these two guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:99">[30:16:99]</a>. They also identified a younger demographic of athletes, entertainers, and "young moguls" who could become lifetime customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.

Marquee Jets started by leasing time on NetJets' planes, which meant NetJets carried the inventory risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>. Marquee Jets acted primarily as a marketing organization, marking up the hours they leased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:99">[36:15:99]</a>. In their first year, they generated nearly $200 million in sales, with an average customer spending $235,000 to $250,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:99">[37:44:99]</a>. As they grew to 4,000 members and $1 billion in annual revenue, their model shifted to requiring them to purchase airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:24:99">[36:24:99]</a>. Itzler notes that this partnership was incredibly fruitful, leading to NetJets acquiring Marquee Jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. NetJets itself was later sold to Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:99">[02:56:99]</a>.

Itzler admits he was a "terrible operator" and "terrible manager," but excelled at sales and creating talk-worthy opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:02:99">[35:02:99]</a>. They hired a CEO early on, allowing him to focus on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>. A key strategy for acquiring their first customers was targeting high-profile individuals to establish credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:99">[39:00:99]</a>.

Itzler found his first Marquee Jets customer, Josh Koppelman (who later became a famous VC), by strategically buying all the muffins from a coffee shop at a TED conference in Monterey, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>. When Koppelman tried to buy a muffin and found none, Itzler offered him an "extra" one, initiating a conversation that led to the first sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:99">[41:01:99]</a>. Itzler then "serviced the hell out of him," going above and beyond by providing services like a list of pediatricians for his kids in Mexico or making dinner reservations for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>. This exceptional service led to Koppelman giving him a referral, a strategy Itzler repeated for five years to grow the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

Itzler also met his wife, [[Jess Mahs entrepreneurial journey and success | Spanx]] founder [[Jess Mahs entrepreneurial journey and success | Sara Blakely]], through Marquee Jets, as she was a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:17:99">[38:17:99]</a>.

## Zico Coconut Water

Itzler continued his pattern of identifying niche markets when he ventured into Zico Coconut Water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:00">[45:29:00]</a>. His interest stemmed from researching hydration for a 100-mile race, where he discovered coconut water and used it to power his 22-hour and 30-minute finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:20:00">[46:20:00]</a>. Convinced it was the "new Gatorade" and a better, all-natural option, he spent a year trying to figure out how to import it but couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:99">[46:52:99]</a>.

Employing the same partnership model from Marquee Jets, Itzler approached Coca-Cola with the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>. The president of Coke's emerging brands division, a friend of a Marquee Jets customer, agreed to a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:00">[47:30:00]</a>. When Coke expressed interest only in buying existing brands, not PowerPoints, Itzler partnered with Zico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.

During a challenging meeting with Coke, Itzler impulsively mentioned that actor Matt Damon was his partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>. Damon, also a Marquee Jets customer, had expressed interest in getting involved in Itzler's coconut water venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:99">[48:15:99]</a>. Itzler called Damon and asked him to film a 35-second video of himself getting a coconut, chopping it open, and saying, "There's got to be a better way than this," which ultimately secured the deal with Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:99">[49:15:99]</a>. Coca-Cola eventually bought Zico outright two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>.

## Current Ventures and Philosophy

Itzler's approach to [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurship]] involves continuously seeking new opportunities and often leveraging partnerships. He is currently exploring the pickle market, noting that 75% of Americans eat pickles, yet there's a lack of innovation and strong branding in the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>. He sees it as a "marketing problem" he can solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:27:00">[58:27:00]</a>.

He also conceptualized "Quickies"—ready-made, eight-ounce alcoholic shots that could be sold at liquor store countertops, similar to Five Hour Energy's impulse buy strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. He even suggested a strategy of consolidating liquor store countertop space for advertising, then selling that space to large brands like Nabisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

Now 55, Itzler emphasizes that "more isn't better; better is better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. He prioritizes maintaining his health, family, and friendships over solely chasing financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He often says "no" to high-aggravation projects, even if they offer high rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. An example of this was his idea eight years ago to make commercial travel feel like private travel, allowing passengers to pay extra for back-door access to planes and a more seamless experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. While lucrative, he decided against pursuing it due to the potential energy drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Itzler uses a "big-ass calendar" to plan his year, including races, speaking engagements, and family travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. He has several personal philosophies:
*   **Musogi:** Inspired by an old Japanese ritual, Itzler's interpretation means undertaking one "big year-defining thing" annually, which should have a tangible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. Examples include his bike ride across America, living with David Goggins, or starting a new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Kevin's Rule:** Named after a friend, this rule involves doing something he normally wouldn't every other weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This creates mini-adventures throughout the year and enriches life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   **Three-Minute Daily Networking:** Itzler advocates spending three minutes a day sending texts or emails to "compliment, congratulate, or console" friends, suppliers, or colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. This simple practice helps build and maintain authentic relationships and creates "permission slips" for future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. He also prefers handwritten letters for their strong impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

Itzler believes that the feeling of selling a business is the same as finishing a marathon, walking an old lady across the street, or any other action that makes one feel good about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. He emphasizes not getting lost in the "hustle and grind" culture at the expense of family, health, and friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

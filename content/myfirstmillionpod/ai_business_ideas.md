This article presents ten specific [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities | AI business ideas]], aiming to provide concrete applications rather than general enthusiasm about AI's potential [00:00:36]. The insights come from an entrepreneur and "idea guy" who has previously run an idea lab and invested approximately $2 million in about a dozen [[ai_business_ideas_and_opportunities | AI companies]] [00:00:40]. The speaker has also reviewed hundreds of other AI companies, gaining significant exposure to the space [00:01:04].

## A Look Back: Predicting the AI Wave

Three years prior to this discussion, in July 2020, the speaker published a podcast episode titled "Is GPT the next big thing?" [00:01:37]. At that time, ChatGPT did not exist, and access to GPT-3 was limited [00:01:57]. The speaker and his co-host believed it would be the next big thing [00:02:19]. As of the discussion, OpenAI is valued at $90 billion, doing a billion dollars annually, and ChatGPT became the fastest-growing product in history, reaching 100 million users [00:02:23].

The speaker draws parallels to past "tidal waves" of opportunity for entrepreneurs, comparing AI to the advent of the internet and mobile technology [00:03:26]. He recalls the internet's early days and the subsequent mobile revolution with the iPhone, which unlocked new possibilities like Uber (GPS), Snapchat/Instagram (camera), and WhatsApp (constant connectivity) [00:04:07]. The current AI wave is presented as a similar, transformative moment [00:03:38].

The specific ideas shared are intended to "spark ideas" and "start a bonfire" in the listener's brain, rather than being definitive solutions [00:05:44].

## 10 Specific AI Business Opportunities

### 10. Eliminate the Wait: AI Sales Agents

Despite the internet's speed, "waiting" still exists in business processes [00:06:34]. Many businesses, like recruiting firms or pest control services, require potential customers to book calls days in advance, leading to cooled-off leads and high drop-off rates [00:07:07].

An [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI phone agent]] can eliminate this wait by immediately responding to inquiries [00:07:48]. For example, a company called "Same Day" uses [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI phone agents]] to qualify customers, answer questions, and even provide sales pitches instantly [00:07:37]. While early versions may seem slow, the immediate conversion rate is expected to be higher than traditional human-led processes due to the elimination of friction and subsequent steps in the funnel [00:09:12]. This technology is expected to improve significantly [00:09:47]. The opportunity exists to become the "AI phone sales guy" for businesses that currently don't answer calls or lack phone numbers [00:10:07].

### 9. Therapy for Everybody: AI Therapists

Therapy is becoming less taboo, with multiple billion-dollar startups connecting people to therapists [00:10:45]. However, cost and privacy remain significant barriers for most people who could benefit from a supportive listener [00:11:19].

The solution is an [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI therapist]] in everyone's pocket, trained on millions of hours of therapy transcripts [00:12:00]. This would drastically reduce the cost to $5-10 per month, making it accessible to a much wider audience [00:12:24]. Similar to how Hims and Ro built billion-dollar companies by increasing access and privacy for sensitive medical issues, an [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI therapist]] could 100x the number of people receiving mental health benefits [00:11:50]. This might need to be framed as a "life coach" rather than a medical service to navigate regulations [00:12:56].

### 8. Robots That Automate Warehousing

Based on the speaker's "export framework" – identifying what large companies built internally and then productizing it for wider use – warehouse automation presents a massive opportunity [00:14:14]. Amazon, for example, invested billions in R&D to automate its warehouses with robots [00:13:33].

Only 2% of all fulfillment warehouses currently use robotics, but this number is projected to go "very close to 100%" [00:15:31]. The business plan is to figure out what will drive this shift from 2% to 100% adoption, whether it's new robotics technology, better sales processes, or consulting services [00:15:41].

### 7. Consulting: McKinsey for AI

Technology adoption is not evenly distributed [00:16:11]. While [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI can help businesses become more efficient]], smarter, and better serve customers, it won't appear overnight in every company [00:16:30].

A significant opportunity lies in building an [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_business_processes | AI-specific consulting practice]] [00:17:15]. This could involve identifying a specific customer type (e.g., mid-market industrial companies, law firms, dental practices) and a suitable AI tool or process to help them [00:17:28]. Such a practice could become a multi-million dollar service business and eventually be acquired by larger consulting firms like McKinsey or Deloitte [00:17:36].

Another angle is to create "AI for X" conferences, focusing on how AI applies to specific industries (e.g., AI for Healthcare, AI for Farming) rather than general AI conferences [00:18:27]. This niche approach caters directly to industry professionals seeking to implement AI [00:18:51].

### 6. Cameo: Digital Likeness Licensing

Celebrities and influencers monetize their name, face, and voice through deals that often require significant time and travel [00:19:26]. With [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI]], specifically deepfake technology, it's possible to create fake videos of anyone [00:19:50].

The opportunity here is not in the technology itself, which is largely available, but in managing the *rights* [00:20:33]. A business could create a "digital likeness license" or a platform for managing these rights [00:20:48]. By securing agreements with athletes, celebrities, and their agencies (like CAA, WME), this company would become the official rights holder and licensing technology provider [00:20:50]. This creates a strong moat, as celebrities will want official, controlled ways for brands to use their AI likeness [00:21:30]. In the future, a celebrity like LeBron James could approve a McDonald's commercial via an API request, paying a licensing fee, without ever needing to physically film it [00:22:08].

### 5. The Anti-Cameo: AI Protection and Detection

The flip side of deepfake technology is its misuse, such as creating unauthorized fake videos of celebrities like Mr. Beast or Taylor Swift for scams or defamation [00:22:35].

This creates a need for an "anti-Cameo" service: a protection, detection, and monitoring service for celebrities and companies [00:23:30]. This service would scour the web to ensure their digital likeness is not being used in unauthorized ways (e.g., deepfake porn, unendorsed ads) [00:23:37]. This is also a strong use case for blockchain technology, where individuals or entities can digitally sign their media with a private key to verify its authenticity [00:23:54]. Unsigned media would then be considered untrustworthy [00:24:25].

### 4. AI Tutors

Education is a vast market [00:24:52]. The idea is to provide everyone with their own [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI tutor]] [00:24:58]. This tutor would be patient, infinitely intelligent, and capable of:
*   Explaining concepts from a picture of a problem [00:25:07].
*   Providing more examples, slowing down or speeding up explanations [00:25:14].
*   Quizzing the student to check understanding [00:25:18].
*   Drawing and animating diagrams better than a human [00:25:23].
*   Tracking mastery and customizing curricula based on individual needs [00:25:33].

This could be a game-changer for learning, akin to having a personalized Sal Khan for every subject and learning style [00:26:07].

### 3. Call Center Accent Changes

Many customer service operations are offshore to reduce costs [00:26:48]. However, accent differences and connection quality can lead to customer frustration and lower satisfaction [00:26:53].

[[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI companies]] are developing "accent removal" technology that can modify a call center agent's voice on the fly, making an agent in India sound like an agent in California [00:27:10]. Businesses would be willing to pay a premium (e.g., 5-10% more) to remove accents, leading to higher customer satisfaction scores and fewer complaints [00:27:28]. This leverages the ability to imitate anyone's voice for a specific business context [00:27:57].

### 2. AI Porn / The Fantasy Factory

Pornography has historically been an early adopter of new technologies (e.g., video streaming, online payments) [00:28:25]. The speaker believes AI offers significant benefits for this industry.

On the demand side, [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI porn]] allows for infinite personalization [00:28:45]. Given the vast number of categories and niches in traditional porn, AI can cater to a trillion fantasies, providing highly specific content tailored to individual tastes [00:28:51]. This is analogous to the shift from Blockbuster to Netflix or America's Funniest Home Videos to TikTok [00:29:20].

On the supply side, [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI porn]] is argued to be more ethical ("cruelty-free makeup," "vegan leather" analogy) [00:29:52]. It could satisfy demand without subjecting human performers to the lifestyle of a porn professional [00:30:07]. For companies, it would drastically reduce costs (COGS), as there would be no need for revenue sharing with production companies or concerns about copyright issues, reducing costs to merely the GPU cost of content creation [00:30:27].

### 1. The Self-Doing To-Do List: AI Agents

The speaker identifies [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI Agents]] as the biggest opportunity in the "digital intelligence" wave of technology [00:34:26]. Previous waves included:
*   **Information (early internet)**: Winners like Google (finding information) and Amazon (finding stuff) [00:32:31].
*   **Communication (social networking)**: Winners like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, WhatsApp, YouTube, and even Uber (human coordination) [00:33:03].
*   **Value (crypto)**: Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a trillion dollars in digital value [00:33:40].

The "digital intelligence" wave, or [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI]], is now emerging [00:34:26]. While companies like Nvidia (chips) and OpenAI (models) have thrived, the missing piece is the [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI agent]] [00:34:47].

The concept of a "self-doing to-do list" means instead of a person setting a goal, creating a list of actions, and then executing them, an [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI agent]] would take the goal, generate the action list, and then *do it* [00:36:14].

For example, for an e-commerce business aiming to reduce inventory waste, the [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI agent]] could:
1.  Analyze inventory to identify fast and slow movers [00:37:54].
2.  Put slow movers on sale [00:38:01].
3.  Analyze fast movers for unmet demand [00:38:04].
4.  Create and send purchase orders to factories [00:38:10].

Another example: to lose 15 lbs, the [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI agent]] could:
1.  Take current weight [00:38:42].
2.  Create a calorie meal plan and workout plan [00:38:44].
3.  Break down the meal plan into recipes and ingredients [00:38:54].
4.  Order ingredients via Instacart for home delivery [00:38:58].

This vision implies a future where work "gets done for you" through intelligent systems that use both creative ("right brain") and analytical ("left brain") capabilities [00:41:37]. While acknowledging potential ethical concerns (like the "paperclip maximizer" thought experiment), the focus remains on the transformative potential of [[ai_agents_and_business_applications | AI]] to improve lives [00:40:43].

Craig Clemens, a marketer who has sold over a billion dollars of products online, attributes his success to understanding what he calls the "seven human hijacks." These are tactics that [[innovative_product_development_and_launch_strategies | marketers]] use to "hijack the limbic system of the brain," compelling people to pay attention and respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:06">[05:44:06]</a>. Through historical and modern examples, Clemens illustrates how these strategies have shaped daily behaviors and product perceptions.

## Edward Bernays: The Father of Public Relations

Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud's nephew and often called the "father of public relations," is credited with literally creating [[role_of_culture_in_marketing_and_branding | consumerism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>. Before Bernays, people generally bought clothes for work, especially outside the upper classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:07">[04:42:07]</a>. Bernays helped shift this perception by making clothing about "expression," leading to increased purchases and a more seasonal approach to fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>.

### Strategic Campaigns and Perception Shifts

Bernays' influence is evident in several major campaigns that altered public perception and behavior:

*   **"Torches of Freedom" (Cigarettes)**: In the 1930s, Bernays was hired by Lucky Strike to expand their market beyond men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:12">[24:04:12]</a>. At the time, it was illegal and considered unladylike for women to smoke in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:01">[24:45:01]</a>. Capitalizing on the women's rights movement, Bernays orchestrated an event at the Easter Parade in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:07">[25:05:07]</a>. Socialites were instructed to light cigarettes at a specific corner where reporters were gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:23">[25:38:23]</a>. Bernays' crew then informed reporters that these women were "declaring their rights with these torches of Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:04">[26:16:04]</a>. This public relations stunt turned smoking for women into a [[role_of_culture_in_marketing_and_branding | movement]], changing its perception to be associated with being "badass" or "sexy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:05">[26:35:05]</a>. This leveraged the human desire to [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | rebel]] or feel superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:13">[27:52:13]</a>.

*   **"Gala Green Ball" (Lucky Strike Packaging)**: Despite the "Torches of Freedom" success, women weren't buying Lucky Strikes because their green packaging was considered an "ugly color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:49">[28:47:49]</a>. Bernays organized the "Gala Green Ball" at the Waldorf Hotel, where prominent women wore green outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:51">[29:19:51]</a>. Magazines followed these socialites, and green decor became fashionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:49">[29:25:49]</a>. Within a year, green became the most fashionable color, leading Lucky Strike to become the number one selling cigarette for women, who subconsciously desired the green box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:15">[29:47:15]</a>. This demonstrated the power of using "people of prominence" for "unquestionable proof" and tapping into the desire to [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | rebel]] or feel superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:17">[30:06:17]</a>.

*   **"The Great American Breakfast" (Bacon)**: Hired by Beachnut bacon, Bernays sought to increase bacon consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:47">[34:48:47]</a>. He asked the company's staff doctor if a "hearty breakfast containing bacon would be the best way to start your day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:50">[35:09:50]</a>. The doctor agreed, and Bernays had him write to 5,000 other doctors asking the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:02">[35:24:02]</a>. When 4,500 doctors agreed, the results were shared with newspapers, leading to headlines like "Doctors agree a hearty breakfast containing bacon is the best way to store energy to last throughout your workday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:10">[35:47:10]</a>. This created the perception of bacon as a breakfast staple, using "unquestionable proof" from experts and selling the dream of more energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:35">[36:15:35]</a>.

## The Power of Demonstration and Events

Beyond Bernays, other marketers effectively shaped perception through powerful demonstrations and creating events:

*   **Otis Elevators**: Elisha Otis's elevators initially sold poorly due to public fear of elevator accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:21">[12:06:21]</a>. PT Barnum suggested a grand demonstration at the Crystal Palace in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:04">[12:34:04]</a>. Otis stood on a raised elevator platform, and his assistant cut the main cable with an axe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. The safety brake system activated, dropping the elevator only a few feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:48">[13:13:48]</a>. Otis declared, "All safe here, gentlemen, all safe," words that were famously published in newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:39">[13:31:39]</a>. This [[the_role_of_powerful_demonstrations_in_advertising | powerful demonstration]] and staged "event" created "unquestionable proof" of safety, leading to a massive increase in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:08">[13:43:08]</a>. The phrase "nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd" encapsulates the effectiveness of making advertising an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:44">[14:35:44]</a>.

*   **Pepsodent Toothpaste**: In the 1920s, only 5% of people brushed their teeth daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:08">[07:12:08]</a>. Claude Hopkins created a masterful ad campaign for Pepsodent, focusing on a "film that discolors the whitest teeth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. The ad instructed people to rub their tongue over their teeth to feel this film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:42">[07:57:42]</a>. It promised that Pepsodent would remove this film, revealing a "movie star smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:28">[08:15:28]</a>. This [[the_role_of_powerful_demonstrations_in_advertising | powerful demonstration]] that anyone could do, combined with selling the "dream" of a movie star smile and making it about the user's benefit, led to 85% of Americans brushing daily within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. The unique "tingle" of Pepsodent also reinforced the perception of effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:04">[09:14:04]</a>.

*   **Modern Demonstrations**:
    *   **Mini Katana**: This company sells swords despite restrictions on advertising weapons online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. They hire [[impact_of_online_communities_and_influencer_marketing | YouTubers]] and [[impact_of_online_communities_and_influencer_marketing | TikTokers]] to create [[the_role_of_powerful_demonstrations_in_advertising | powerful demonstrations]], such as cutting a bullet in half or slicing a steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:02">[16:34:02]</a>. These "unnecessary" but visually shocking demonstrations are highly effective at conveying the product's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:19">[17:08:19]</a>.
    *   **Dr. Oz**: Dr. Oz regularly performed [[the_role_of_powerful_demonstrations_in_advertising | powerful demonstrations]] to promote supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:20">[18:09:20]</a>. For Garcinia Cambogia, he used a mannequin with balloons representing fat cells and a pin representing the berry, dramatically popping the balloons to show its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:05">[19:09:05]</a>. This visual, dramatic, and exaggerated demonstration made it about the audience's desire for "miracle weight loss" and was incredibly effective, despite ethical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:02">[19:54:02]</a>.
    *   **Elon Musk (Cybertruck)**: [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | Elon Musk]], despite being an engineer, is a master of marketing demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:21">[22:01:21]</a>. For the Cybertruck, he promoted its "bulletproof" nature by showing a door riddled with bullet holes that didn't penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:28">[22:17:28]</a>. This, despite a botched sledgehammer demonstration, highlights the importance of creating powerful, visual, and dramatic proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:40">[22:33:40]</a>.
    *   **Anti-Drug Campaigns**: The iconic "This is your brain on drugs" commercial featuring an egg sizzling in a frying pan is a prime example of a powerful demonstration that creates an unforgettable image and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25:00">[53:25:00]</a>.

## Changing Daily Behavior and Creating Movements

*   **Sunkist Orange Juice**: In the early 1900s, oranges were overproduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:32">[37:52:32]</a>. Albert Lasker, who later worked with Claude Hopkins, consolidated orange growers under the "Sunkist" brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:07">[38:09:07]</a>. He observed growers squeezing oranges for their children as a special treat and realized the potential of juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:13">[38:28:13]</a>. Lasker then invented a cheap juicer and launched a campaign promoting oranges' vitamins and nutrients, tying orange juice to meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:03">[39:01:03]</a>. By offering free juicers with proof of purchase, he effectively changed a daily behavior, making orange juice a breakfast staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>.

*   **Nike and Athletic Shoes**: In the 1970s, running was not a popular activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:02:00">[44:02:00]</a>. Steve Prefontaine, a dominant US runner, became a media figure for the emerging Nike brand, which was just starting to make its own shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:56">[43:07:56]</a>. Prefontaine wearing Nike shoes provided "unquestionable proof" of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a>. His popularity helped make running "cool again," and Nike leveraged this tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>. People also began wearing athletic shoes as daily attire to [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | rebel]] against traditional footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>, fundamentally changing the shoe market where athletic shoes are now bestsellers, mostly worn for non-athletic activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:37">[44:57:37]</a>. Nike further solidified this with campaigns featuring [[the_role_of_personal_branding_and_influence_in_business | Michael Jordan]], selling the "dream" of being able to "fly like Mike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>.

*   **Probiotics**: Craig Clemens' company, Golden Hippo, launched a probiotic brand when the concept of the "microbiome" was largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:24">[59:51:24]</a>. Instead of directly selling probiotics, they created an educational video explaining how artificial sweeteners and sugars were affecting people's food supply and how good bacteria could help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12:00">[01:00:12:00]</a>. This video, which went "absolutely bananas" and garnered over 100 million views, created the biggest probiotic brand in the world at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17:00">[01:00:17:00]</a>. This involved educating consumers (making it about them) and changing a daily behavior (taking a supplement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01:00">[01:03:01:00]</a>. They also later leveraged the curious market by using headlines like "Doctor says throw your probiotics in the trash" to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06:00">[01:04:06:00]</a>.

## The Seven Human Hijacks

Craig Clemens summarizes his marketing principles into seven "human hijacks" that impact product perception:
1.  **Make it about them**: Focus on the customer and the benefits they will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55:00">[01:04:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Make it an event**: Create a public spectacle or a phenomenon that attracts attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01:00">[01:05:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Powerful demonstration**: Show, don't just tell, the product's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07:00">[01:05:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Show unquestionable proof**: Use experts, influencers, or personal risk to validate claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19:00">[01:05:19:00]</a>.
5.  **Change a daily behavior**: Introduce or modify a routine, ideally an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31:00">[01:05:31:00]</a>.
6.  **Sell the dream**: Focus on the aspirational outcome or transformation the product enables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08:00">[01:06:08:00]</a>.
7.  **Help them rebel or feel superior**: Tap into the human desire to go against the grain or stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21:00">[01:06:21:00]</a>.

By applying these strategies, marketers have consistently shaped public perception and consumer behavior throughout history.

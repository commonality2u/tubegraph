Jess Ma is an entrepreneur known for building approximately 10 companies with a combined value of $950 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. She is regarded by some as one of the best [[early_entrepreneurship_and_diverse_business_ventures | entrepreneurs]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and was placed on a short list of impressive individuals by Paul Graham, alongside Sam Altman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Transition to Bold Science

Ma initially built a financial SaaS company called Indera, which focused on accounting, tax, and bill management software and services for businesses like Slack, Pinterest, DoorDash, Instacart, and Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. She built Indera without traditional [[venture_backed_companies_and_special_situations_investments | venture funding]], relying on angel investors and retaining most ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. After a decade of operating Indera, she realized she no longer wanted to be a CEO, driven by a perception that many billionaires build diversified holding companies and are not always the direct operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

A significant personal tragedy, the unexpected death of her boyfriend, led her to a period of depression where she couldn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This experience prompted her to ask herself: "What would I do if I wasn't scared of failure?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This introspective question became a turning point, leading her to hire CEOs for her existing companies and explore new, more audacious ventures, particularly in biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. She acknowledged her initial insecurity, having received a C-minus in biology in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, but decided to learn and enter the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Embracing the "Beginner's Mind"
Ma emphasizes the importance of embracing the role of a beginner and being comfortable with initial awkwardness and self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Her approach to learning complex fields like biotech involves hiring tutors, consuming educational content (TED Talks, podcasts), and directly meeting and conversing with scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Defining Bold Science

Ma describes "bold science" as projects that aim for non-incremental advancements—significant leaps in function or quality of life, rather than minor improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. This often involves taking a fundamentally different approach to long-standing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

> "What if you could get to the root cause and reverse cancer for example... What if killing cancer is the wrong approach and actually cancer happens because your cells are trying to protect themselves in some way and if you could train them and coach your to killing them let's rehabilitate them get them to integrate back in with their surroundings then you could fix cancer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>

## Key Biotechnology Ventures

### Bioelectricity Research
Ma's [[strategic_business_ventures_in_emerging_tech | strategic business ventures in emerging tech]] include a holding company for biotech [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | venture creation]] centered around scientist Mike Levin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Levin's research posits that bioelectricity, rather than genetics, primarily dictates lifespan, cancer development, and body morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. This challenges the conventional view that genetics are the sole determinant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>. Examples from Levin's work include manipulating bioelectricity to grow an eyeball on a different part of a tadpole's body, which then connects to the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

Companies under this holding company include:
*   **Sju**: A company focused on overcoming drug resistance in treatments like leukemia or chemo, where drugs may stop working, leaving patients without viable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.
*   **Anthrobots**: A company developing programmable human biobots, which has been featured in *Nature* magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.

### Future Concepts
Ma is also interested in concepts like extending human lives by 30%, potentially reaching 120 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Another idea she explores is the possibility of artificial embryo generation and growing babies in a "fish tank" from raw genetic material without sperm or egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>, although she believes this is likely decades away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>.

## A "Manifestation Studio" Approach

Ma views her holding company not as a traditional holdco or [[venture_backed_companies_and_special_situations_investments | venture studio]], but as an "extension of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>—a "manifestation studio" for her ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. She employs a team of brilliant people to help turn her concepts into reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.

Her strategy involves:
*   **Networking and Proactiveness**: Ma emphasizes the importance of meeting people in person ("belly to belly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a> and actively seeking out individuals doing interesting work, even flying across the country or internationally for meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. She notes that this proactive approach earned her meetings with prominent figures like Justin Kan (Twitch) and Marc Benioff when she was only 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Resourcefulness**: She believes that instead of lacking resources like time or money, one needs to be resourceful to acquire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This includes hiring experts and building teams to manage tasks like investor relations and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Long-term Vision over Immediate Profit**: While some of her ventures are "cash-printing" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>, a significant portion are "bold" bets that may not yield immediate profit and carry a high risk of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>. The driving force is mission orientation and the fun of creating something impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.

## Personal Optimization and Mindset

Ma attributes her ability to manage multiple complex ventures to a disciplined approach to personal optimization:

*   **Coaching**: She works with two coaches monthly to ensure her mindset is "screwed on properly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Peer Groups**: She participates in CEO groups like YPO (Young Presidents' Organization), considering it essential for growth and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **Health and Longevity**: She collaborates with five concierge doctors to create a custom health plan focused on longevity and mental acuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This includes custom-compounded supplements and regular exosome IVs, which are believed to help lower biological age, increase energy, and improve cellular autophagy (body's ability to clear old cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. She estimates spending $15,000-$25,000 annually on these practices, considering it a high ROI [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | investment]] in her own capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

### Financial Strategies and Mindset
Ma highlights that successful, wealthy individuals often think differently about finances. They prioritize tax optimization, spending significant time (e.g., 5-10% of their time) on it, and seeking advice from multiple top tax strategists who work with billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. She also notes that purchasing expensive assets like jets or yachts can be financially advantageous due to tax write-offs and financing structures, sometimes making them cash-flow positive or assets that hold value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

She advocates for an [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | investment]] in diverse knowledge, attending conferences outside of one's primary field (e.g., farming conferences for a tech person) to gain new perspectives and synthesize novel ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. This broad knowledge base enables individuals to be more interesting advisors and fosters greater resourcefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

## Inspired by Mark Jannay: Selling Custom Novelty Dollar Bills

An early side hustle by entrepreneur Mark Jannay involved selling custom novelty dollar bills for $15, despite their face value of $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

> [!example] The Business Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
> At 15 years old, Jannay saw a dollar bill on eBay with Michael Jordan's face instead of George Washington's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He realized it was a normal dollar bill with a sticker paper over Washington's face, a process that could be replicated easily at places like Office Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He then created his own versions and sold them on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Key Takeaways from the Dollar Bill Hustle
*   **Profit Margin:** Selling a $1 bill for $15, including shipping, resulted in a general profit of about $1,500 per day, with Janny averaging 100 bills sold daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He scaled this to $10,000 a day in sales, becoming the largest seller of custom novelty collectible dollar bills on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Growth Hacking:** He implemented a "growth hack" by direct messaging bidders who didn't win an auction, offering them the bill at their highest bid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This strategy helped him become a top-ranked seller, improving his organic search visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Arbitrage Opportunity:** This illustrates an "arbitrage opportunity" – buying low and selling high based on a perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Modern Adaptations of the Novelty Dollar Bill Idea
1.  **Direct Replication:** The same concept could be applied on platforms like eBay or Etsy, potentially with different celebrity faces like Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
2.  **Trending Pop Culture Props:** Create props related to trending movies or music, similar to the "McLovin ID" from *Superbad* or the "Bad Motherf***** wallet" from *Pulp Fiction* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This could involve using AI tools to create personalized avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These items are cheap to print, laminate, and ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Custom Jewelry (Caitlyn Minimalist)
Caitlyn Minimalist, one of Etsy's top-selling stores, specializes in custom jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Her breakthrough came from creating a bracelet with a friend's deceased parent's signature in their handwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Customers send a picture of handwriting, which is then etched onto metal jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This business has generated approximately $80-90 million in lifetime sales through 2 million transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Custom Hoodies/Apparel
Another idea seen on [[business_opportunities_on_tiktok | TikTok]] involves custom hoodies that stitch a silhouette of a couple's photo, making it a meaningful gift for holidays like Valentine's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Print-on-Demand (Teespring)
Teespring popularized on-demand t-shirt printing by leveraging Facebook's targeting capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. They targeted users by last name or location with personalized slogans (e.g., "The one thing we all know about Smiths is that they love to party" or "I'm from Boston and I'm proud") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This strategy resulted in extremely low customer acquisition costs and rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Pet-Themed Merchandise
The concept of putting pet faces on socks gained immense popularity, with a company called Jungle Creations reportedly achieving $1 million in sales in a week and $17 million in revenue in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This extends to [[ecommerce_business_ideas | ecommerce business ideas]] like mass-customized pet portraits/paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

> [!tip] Mass Customization
> The common thread among these [[profitable_business_ideas_in_the_womens_market | profitable business ideas in the womens market]] is "mass customization" – offering personalized products at scale. If you can streamline the manufacturing process for such items, there's significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Last-Minute Gifting Service via Cloud Kitchens

Inspired by traditional gifting companies like Harry & David (acquired by 1-800 Flowers for $142 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>) and Omaha Steaks (a privately owned mail-order steak business founded in 1920, generating hundreds of millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>), there's an opportunity for a modern, instant gifting service.

> [!idea] The "Birthday Eats" or "Last-Minute Gifts" Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>
> Build a brand that operates as a cloud kitchen nationwide, optimized specifically for gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.
> *   **Product Offering:** Focus on food items (e.g., pizzas, wings, slushies, boba tea, Cinnabon, pints of ice cream) that are delivered via DoorDash or Uber Eats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
> *   **Presentation:** Unlike regular restaurant deliveries, these gifts would be nicely packaged in baskets, include bows, and feature handwritten notes to convey the occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
> *   **Competitive Advantage:** Address the common frustration with traditional services (e.g., 1-800 Flowers) that often can't accommodate same-day or last-minute orders, especially on holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
> *   **"Clout Kitchen" Model:** Partner with a recognizable celebrity (e.g., Ryan Seacrest or Mariah Carey) as the face of the brand to enhance visibility and appeal across platforms like Uber Eats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

## [[Developing Million Dollar Business Ideas | Developing Million Dollar Business Ideas]]: Unpopular Truths for Success

The discussion highlights several "unpopular things" or realities about entrepreneurship and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

*   **Overnight Success is Real:** Despite common narratives of 10-year overnight successes, genuine overnight successes (within 1-6 months) are possible and do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Examples include companies reaching $20 million in revenue in their second year or $10 million in profit in their first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Proximity is Power:** Where you live and the people you surround yourself with significantly impact your career, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Being in an environment where you are *not* the smartest person challenges you to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **Luck is Real:** While not entirely in one's control, luck plays a significant role in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. The *magnitude* of success (e.g., $80 million vs. $800 million) often involves a large degree of luck and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. However, actions can increase the amount of luck you encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Value of Top Universities:** Attending an Ivy League or top-20 university is generally worth it, even with debt, due to the connections, resources, and influence it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. The mindset of actively leveraging these resources is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   **Importance of Technical Skills:** Having a specialized technical skill (e.g., coding, design, copywriting, sales) is a massive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Being a "generalist" without a core strength is often seen as a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. True generalists are exceptional at one or two core skills and competent in several others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **People Don't Often Change:** It's a safe assumption that people generally do not change their fundamental behaviors, especially those who "talk the talk" but don't "walk the walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. When recruiting, it's often more effective to hire individuals who are already great, rather than trying to "fix" or transform them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Effort vs. Outcome:** For "massive outsized world-changing companies" (e.g., Tesla, Stripe), extreme dedication (80+ hour weeks, zero balance) is likely needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. However, significant success can still be achieved working 40 hours a week, especially compared to the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking Before Family:** Achieving early success and taking meaningful risks *before* having a family provides a significant advantage due to less time constraints, responsibility, and financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. While not impossible to succeed later, it becomes objectively more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This is an "uncomfortable truth" but a "game theory optimal way to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

> [!note] All Rules Can Be Broken
> Despite these "unpopular truths," it's important to remember that all these "rules" can be completely broken, and there are many examples of success that defy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.

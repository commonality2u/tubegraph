## The Cost of a High-End Lifestyle

A hypothetical example of living a desirable lifestyle in Brooklyn highlights the significant financial commitment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. A $5 million brownstone in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, requires an initial down payment of $1.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Monthly expenses would include approximately $20,000 for mortgage and interest, plus an additional $2,000-$3,000 for maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Furnishing such a home could cost between $50,000 and $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Annual costs also factor in a nanny ($40,000-$50,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> and food ($30,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

In total, living this lifestyle could amount to $600,000 to $700,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For individuals earning over $1 million a year in New York City, half of their income goes to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Therefore, to cover $600,000 in annual expenses, one would need to earn $1.2 million just to break even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Friends residing in similar areas confirm high annual expenditures, ranging from $500,000 to $800,000, with one friend spending $650,000 annually without including their vacation home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Pathways to Wealth and [[entrepreneur_success_stories | Entrepreneur Success Stories]]

The sheer number of expensive homes and apartments in cities like Brooklyn and Manhattan raises questions about how so many people can afford them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### The "Story Behind Everything"

Many homeowners acquired their properties years ago when prices were significantly lower, often less than half or even 35% of current values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This reduces monthly payments and property taxes, making the cost of living more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Research into brownstone owners in NYC revealed that many were teachers, artists, or professors – professions not typically associated with earning enough to afford such homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The conclusion is that a significant number received financial help, often from wealthy family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### The Need to Earn a Lot of Money

To save $10 million in New York, even with a $1.5 million annual income and $25,000 monthly living expenses, it would take approximately 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Sustaining a $1.5 million income for over a decade is incredibly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

For employed individuals, jobs like finance, law, medicine, or consulting are among the few that can consistently generate $1-2 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Alternatively, becoming self-employed through owning a small or large business, or a contracting firm, can also lead to significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. [[Entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned | Entrepreneurial journeys and lessons learned]] often involve "lumpy" income curves, with periods of nothing followed by huge payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### The Abundance of Opportunity

There is immense wealth and opportunity in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Observing the high rental costs of apartments ($12,000/month for a top-floor brownstone apartment) emphasizes the astronomical amounts of money being spent and made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Bitterness vs. Inspiration

Wealth often remains a mystery to those not born into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Hearing about others' financial realities, such as spending hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on living expenses, can evoke two reactions: bitterness or inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Most people fall into the "bitterness camp," dismissing others' success as unfair or cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. However, those who choose inspiration gather anecdotes and data points, gaining clarity that there are "a thousand ways to win" and that winning can be bigger than initially imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This mindset helps identify unique and often unconventional ways people build wealth, such as starting a mushroom farm or manufacturing treadmill treads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### The Fast-Growing Friend

A friend demonstrated rapid growth with a new app, charting daily revenue increases from $100 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This person is projected to reach $200,000 in daily revenue soon, illustrating an "HOV lane" or fast lane to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This rapid growth is the culmination of 10 years of [[entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned | building skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, enabling them to potentially make $5-10 million in profit within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This person explicitly set a goal to make $10 million in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, a goal previously unimaginable to the podcasters, but now being realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Allan Wong: The App Developer Millionaire

Allan Wong, also known as "Rego apps" on Reddit, went from "rags to riches" during the 2008 recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. His family, Chinese immigrants, faced hardship after his father's death, leaving him as the sole income earner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. While working full-time at Columbia University, he taught himself to create apps in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

His most popular app was the "5-0 Radio Police Scanner," which allows users to listen to police chatter worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. By 2012, his apps had accumulated 20 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. He had three apps concurrently in the top 10 overall for both paid and free categories in the App Store, a unique achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

On Reddit's FatFIRE community, his net worth was verified by moderators as "over $100 million Liquid Plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. He achieved this through two or three apps with "close to no employees" over 8-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. He reportedly makes $10 million+ a year in his 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

Scott Painter is a serial entrepreneur known for constantly trying to reinvent the auto industry online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. His [[entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned | entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned]] include:

*   **Early Career**: Served as a Spanish interrogator in the Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

*   **Dental Advantage & Vision Incorporated**: Founded consulting businesses helping dentists and other companies with internet transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

TrueCar went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>, but Painter faced a margin call due to buying heavily into his own stock, leading to his resignation and significant personal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. Concurrently, he went through a divorce and his house burned down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.
*   **Fair.com**: The week after these personal crises, he incorporated Fair.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Fair aimed to simplify car ownership by offering long-term rentals with a monthly fee, allowing users to return the car anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Fair raised hundreds of millions, including $300 million from SoftBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>, but ultimately crashed due to market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
*   **Autonomy**: Painter is now back with Autonomy, a startup focused on renting electric cars simply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

Painter is a "multi-time college dropout" who acknowledges significant failures, stating that "three out of 25 things" he tried worked out in his 20-year career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. He attributes his ability to raise capital to playing in the enormous mobility market, where 15% of gross income goes to mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

### Adam Neumann: The WeWork Founder's Second Act

Adam Neumann, the co-founder of WeWork, recently raised $250 million in seed funding for a new apartment business, A1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This venture appears to be a "WeLive" concept, featuring fancy, pre-designed apartment buildings with a strong community focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

Despite widespread criticism of WeWork's challenges, WeWork still exists as a publicly traded company valued at nearly $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. The criticism often stems from Neumann raising too much money at too high a valuation, and his controversial actions like licensing the "We" trademark to himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. However, many view him as a "huge dreamer" with "unbelievable self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

### The Delusional Entrepreneur

Some of the most successful entrepreneurs share a similar profile: they are irrational, delusional, and willing to take enormous risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. While nine out of ten such ventures might fail, the one that succeeds can "change the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Choosing optimism and studying these individuals, even when they seem "crazy," can be more rewarding in the long run, as it allows one to identify and potentially benefit from breakthrough successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This perspective helps in [[overcoming entrepreneurial challenges | overcoming entrepreneurial challenges]] and learning from failures, rather than succumbing to bitterness.

## A "Samar Special": TechTarget and B2B Media

The company TechTarget (TTGT) operates a network of 10-20 niche business-to-business (B2B) media websites, such as Bitpipe.com, which hosts technical whitepapers and webcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>. These websites have minimal monthly traffic but generate $400-$500 million in annual revenue from approximately 3,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. TechTarget is a publicly traded company with a market cap of $2.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

Their business model involves collecting detailed information from professionals (e.g., corporate email, job title, company size) who download articles or attend webinars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. They then sell this qualified lead information to software vendors who are eager to contact individuals actively researching B2B solutions like HR or cloud software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. This model capitalizes on the specific, high-value intent of a small, niche audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. The content quality on these sites is often poor, yet the businesses thrive due to the unique value of the leads they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

## Involvement in Broadway and the Entertainment Industry

Michael Harris, also known as Harry O, was involved in the entertainment industry from an early age, producing Broadway shows and operating various businesses in Los Angeles, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He describes himself as being "in the mix" at a very early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Early Ventures and Production
By age 26, Harris had 11 different businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Among these were production companies and music companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. He also produced concerts and plays, and supported clubs in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. At its peak, his entire business empire employed about 100 to 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> and was generating millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Transition to Music and "The Jingle Factory"
Harris's entry into the entertainment industry started with a business called "The Jingle Factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This company created commercials for local businesses and radio stations like K-L-J and K-J-L-H-M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Working with "The Jingle Factory" brought him into contact with musicians, producers, and singers who would come into the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This connection led him to drift into managing groups and working with various record labels and production companies, including Motown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

He created his own production company, "Why Not Production," because it was difficult for people like him to establish a stronghold in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Through this company, he would help produce artists who lacked financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Producing Broadway Plays
Harris began his involvement with plays when someone presented him with an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He saw it as a creative space for movie business professionals who were out of work but could hone their craft, while also providing entertainment to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

He produced a play called "Checkmate" by author Ron Milner, working with director Woody King from New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This endeavor allowed him to meet notable figures such as Paul Winfield, Vanessa Williams, Richard Lawson, Ruby Dee, and Al Freeman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Harris successfully took "Checkmate" to various cities and ultimately brought it to Broadway with Anita Landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Harris's approach to these ventures was to become the managing partner, investing in the project while also learning every aspect of the business from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. His Broadway venture faced a significant setback when his life "came crashing down" due to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, just before the full-scale launch on Broadway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Founding Death Row Records
While incarcerated, Harris continued to pursue entrepreneurial ventures due to his "energy inside of him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. He was already familiar with the entertainment business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

Death Row Records was established as the "next iteration" of Ruthless Records, following Dr. Dre's disillusionment with the understanding of his value at Ruthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Suge Knight, who was managing artist DLC, was introduced to Dr. Dre, and then Harris was introduced to Suge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

Harris and Suge Knight initially created "Godfather Entertainment," out of which Death Row Records was formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. Harris chose the name Death Row because he was briefly housed on death row in San Quentin prison and was profoundly affected by witnessing young people being sentenced to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

He worked with his attorney, David Kenner, and his ex-wife, Lydia, to assemble Death Row Records while he was still behind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. The label became a "game changer" once Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's voices were heard together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Key artists included [[Snoop Dogg | Snoop Dogg]], [[Tupac Shakur | Tupac]], Kurupt, Lady of Rage, Jewel, and the Dog Pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. The first impactful song that caught attention was "187" from the *Deep Cover* soundtrack, featuring Snoop and Dre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

Death Row Records quickly achieved massive success with albums like *The Chronic* (selling three million quickly), *Doggystyle* (selling close to seven million), and *All Eyez on Me* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Harris reflects that the label changed the game, becoming a major player in the industry and connecting with large companies like Universal and Warner Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. He emphasizes that the company's original intent was enterprising, and it allowed artists to talk about things like police brutality and injustice in their communities through their lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

### Managing Creative Talent
Harris acknowledges the challenge of managing young, creative individuals in a "party environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. He believes that people must be taken where they are, understanding that their background and conditioning influenced their music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. While not justifying past behavior, he points out that many of these individuals, like Snoop Dogg, have since evolved into philanthropists with charities and foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.

He describes [[Dr. Dre | Dr. Dre]] as a consummate professional, observing him effortlessly compose music and conduct "four orchestras" in his home studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. He also admires how [[Snoop Dogg | Snoop Dogg]] can still remember lyrics from 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. Harris respected individuals like Denzel Washington, who was part of the "Checkmate" project, for his consistent character and professional approach to his craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

Regarding Suge Knight's management, Harris states that Suge was creative and in the right place at the right time, connecting the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>. He considers it a tragedy that Suge "imploded" and pulled away from opportunities, believing he could have been one of the biggest entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### Legacy and Future Endeavors
While his career is not over, Harris considers the creation of Death Row Records to be his most impactful work to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. He is now the CEO of the new Death Row Records, which he helped create decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. He hopes to expand the narrative surrounding Death Row beyond its negative aspects to highlight its enterprising nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

He is currently working on various film projects and plans to launch a podcast to share insights into the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. Harris maintains an optimistic outlook and a calm demeanor, attributing it to a profound understanding of life's miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

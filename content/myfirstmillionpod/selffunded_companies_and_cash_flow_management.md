37signals, led by entrepreneur Jason Freed, operates as a self-funded company, often described as a "cash cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company has been in operation for approximately 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, generating tens of millions in annual profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Renowned investor Jason Lin has cited 37signals and Craigslist as the two greatest self-funded cash flow companies he has encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This success is achieved by "kicking the traditional playbook to the curb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, including practices such as setting no goals, working four days a week in the summers, and spending minimal amounts on marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Business Philosophy

### Anti-Long-Term Planning
Jason Freed views long-term planning as a "fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, preferring to "do what I think not what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He believes that plans based on past thoughts can become restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Instead, 37signals operates by "making it up as you go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, focusing on six-week iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> and constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, while paying attention to the present reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Rejecting Goals
The company generally avoids setting specific goals, with their "only goal" being to remain profitable each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, a streak they have maintained for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. They prioritize doing their "best work all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> rather than being driven by external targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Freed argues that goals can lead to disappointment if not met, even by a small margin, and that focus should instead be on the intrinsic value and enjoyment of the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Financial Management and Cash Flow
37signals focuses on maintaining a "high margin business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, keeping costs low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> and revenue high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. They have a diverse customer base of over 100,000 monthly payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This approach allows for a "sloppy in a good way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> operation, reducing financial anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Regarding [[reinvestment_strategy_in_business_growth | reinvestment strategy in business growth]], as an LLC, 37signals distributes all profits to its owners annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. This is partly due to personal income tax on business earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>, but also supported by predictable recurring revenue and low operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. Freed believes that many companies hire too many people and overspend on customer acquisition, leading to low margins and a harder business to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

### Product Development
The company's product development process involves:
1.  **Identifying a point of view:** What needs to change in the world, or what kind of product is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
2.  **Exploration phase:** Spending significant time (e.g., six months) "wandering around an idea" to see where it leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This phase is fluid; if motivation wanes or the idea doesn't "feel good," they stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
3.  **Commitment and Sprints:** Once an idea gains "gravity" and feels right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, they commit and work in six-week chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This is to avoid perfectionism and ensure features are delivered within reasonable timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

#### The Power of "No"
Freed emphasizes that saying "no" is a "precise instrument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, allowing for focus and keeping other possibilities open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. In contrast, saying "yes" to one thing implicitly means saying "no to a lot of things" and can "damage a lot of things" by consuming resources and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

#### Prototyping and Novelty
When prototyping, 37signals advises trying "the wackier, quirkier stuff first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This is because teams tend to become more conservative deeper into a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Prioritizing novel, differentiated features early ensures they are not omitted due to time or patience constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. The public typically demands "normal stuff," so it's up to the developers to introduce "unusual things" that resonate as obvious improvements once seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

## Products & Marketing
37signals has developed products like Basecamp, Backpack, Campfire, Highrise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, and Hey.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. They don't make new products often, doing so "once every handful of years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### The "Once" Initiative
A current focus is "Once" (once.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>, an umbrella brand promoting products that are bought once, rather than rented as a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This model allows users to own the software, including the code for modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Campfire, their old chat tool, was revived as the first "Once" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. It's sold for a one-time fee of $299 for unlimited users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. Freed argues that many software products, now commodities, are still priced as luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### Pre-Launch Marketing: Founder Letters
Jason Freed uses "founder letters" to generate interest in products pre-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. These letters typically articulate a strong point of view, highlight a problem with the current state of affairs (e.g., the "church of recurring revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>), and explain the motivation behind the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. This contrasts with common modern approaches that simply announce funding rounds or use jargon without context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. Freed finds joy in crafting these letters, focusing on rhythm, message, and leaving some mystery to draw the reader in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

### Marketing Spend
37signals spends "next to nothing on marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They attempted to invest $5 million in ads once but found it to be "vanity money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Their low price points make high [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | customer acquisition costs]] impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>, so they rely on their established channels and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. They prioritize sustainability and profits over aggressive growth, believing that focusing on margins and taking profits out is more beneficial than pursuing potential higher multiples through extensive marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This approach contributes to their overall [[bootstrapping_a_saas_company | bootstrapping a SaaS company]] strategy.

## [[Balancing personal wealth aspirations with business growth | Personal Wealth & Financial Freedom]]

Jason Freed has publicly purchased homes for significant amounts, though he attempted to keep these private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He emphasizes a conservative approach to [[passive_income_strategies | investments]] outside of his business, primarily focusing on index funds and select individual companies where he knows the CEO or has a strong understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. He avoids speculative investments like meme stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

Freed values being able to "sleep well at night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a> and avoids risks that jeopardize his personal financial security or the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. His approach to business is rooted in minimizing anxiety, unlike many entrepreneurs who are constantly worried about competition or payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. His focus is on excitement for future projects rather than fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.

He acknowledges the role of "timing and luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a> in their success and doesn't believe he could replicate 37signals' success today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Selling the company would feel like a "loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a> because he enjoys the work and fears not finding something else he'd be good at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This perspective highlights the [[impact_of_financial_freedom_and_effective_time_management | impact of financial freedom]] on one's identity and drive.

### Investment from Jeff Bezos
In 2006 or 2007, Jeff Bezos invested in 37signals, but this was a secondary transaction where he bought shares directly from Jason Freed and his co-founder David <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. No money from this investment went into the business; it was purely for the founders' personal risk reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Bezos was a fan of their different approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. The deal was structured to give Bezos no control or board seat, with a very weak "suggestions clause" regarding future actions like selling or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. As an LLC member, Bezos receives annual distributions and has made his money back "many times over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This is an example of [[venture_backed_companies_and_special_situations_investments | special situations investments]] where external capital does not dictate internal operations.

## Transparency & Openness
Jason Freed's transparency regarding his personal spending, like home purchases, has led to public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He acknowledges that efforts to hide these purchases through LLCs or other means are often unsuccessful due to various information leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This highlights the challenges of [[financial_transparency_in_business | financial transparency in business]] for public figures.

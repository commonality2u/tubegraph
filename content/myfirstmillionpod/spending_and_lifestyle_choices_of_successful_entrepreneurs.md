Successful entrepreneur [[entrepreneurial_stories_and_lessons_from_highprofile_figures | Neil Patel]] has evolved his personal spending habits significantly over the years, from a stated need of $15,000 per month ten years ago when he was single with no children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, to an estimated burn rate of $120,000 to $180,000 per month currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Personal Expenses and Philosophy
Despite his high monthly burn rate, Patel notes he does not have a mortgage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A significant portion of his expenses includes:
*   **Property tax and HOA dues**: Approximately $200,000 per year for his two homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Life insurance**: A whole life policy costing $25,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, which he views as an investment vehicle that builds over time and can be borrowed against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Household staff**: Cleaners, nannies, and a full-time driver, totaling around $57,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He uses a limo company for his driver in Vegas, allowing for parking convenience at locations like casinos or direct airport access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Patel's spending philosophy prioritizes convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He considers private planes his best expense because they optimize for time, allowing him to see his kids more often by facilitating quick in-and-out business trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. He does not expense these personal costs to his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He describes his lifestyle as expensive and acknowledges he "probably should cut back and live a more humble life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Charitable Giving and Financial Strategies
Patel and his wife actively engage in philanthropy, focusing on direct impact rather than large organizational overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. They prioritize self-sufficient programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Examples include:
*   Funding women's education in villages in India and Africa, with the expectation that recipients will return to teach in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. They found higher follow-through rates with women compared to men in these programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Supporting "growing gardens" programs for people with AIDS to ensure proper nutrition for medication absorption, also providing food for the village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   He states they have built schools, including one in Cambodia, though he doesn't personally keep track, his wife handles it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Patel believes his time is better spent making money to donate rather than volunteering, as the financial contribution can have a greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Approach to Wealth and Family
Patel does not intend to leave his children a large inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. He believes in fostering ambition and self-sufficiency, only providing financial assistance if they are truly suffering or for specific, altruistic goals like volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. His focus for his children is on imparting character traits, skills, and a strong mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

He attributes his ability to spend and donate generously to successful [[investment_strategies_and_life_postsale_for_entrepreneurs | investment strategies and life postsale for entrepreneurs]] and the profitability of his businesses. His best [[investment_strategies_and_life_postsale_for_entrepreneurs | financial investments]] have been in:
*   **The stock market**: Primarily in tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, which he invested in early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Angel investments**: Which have performed well for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Acquiring and growing other companies**: Often at 3-5x EBITDA multiples, which he then fixes and grows for cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He has a history of successful [[entrepreneur_success_stories | entrepreneur success stories]], such as acquiring Ubersuggest, a software company, for $120,000, investing $3 million, and growing it to $1 million per month in revenue in less than seven or eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He leverages his ability to secure large amounts of debt at low interest rates (e.g., 3.6% plus SOFR) to finance these acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Patel states he doesn't personally run any of his businesses, instead focusing on generating ideas and entrusting execution to "really good operators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He estimates he owns under 20 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, retaining around 80% equity while giving 10% to the managing partner (who also receives a higher-than-industry salary) and another 10% as an employee pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

He believes in open discussions about personal finances to expand people's worldviews and reveal possibilities, even though he personally finds it "weird to talk about expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

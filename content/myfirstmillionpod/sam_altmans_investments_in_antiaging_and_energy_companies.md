[[Sam Altmans Investment Strategies and Background | Sam Altman]], known for his leadership at Y Combinator and as CEO of OpenAI, has gained attention not only for his work in AI but also for his personal investment strategies and health philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Investment Focus: Energy and Longevity

Sam Altman has reportedly committed a significant portion of his personal liquid net worth to two distinct companies: Helion Energy and Retro Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

*   **Helion Energy:** He invested $375 million of his own money into this energy company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This substantial personal investment had previously sparked questions about his funding sources and prompted discussions about whether he secretly managed a fund, though it appears to be a personal venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Retro Health:** Altman invested $180 million into Retro Health, a [[Business opportunities in longevity and healthcare | health company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He has also expressed a personal interest in eventually using the medicines developed by Retro Health once they become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

These investments highlight Altman's "all eggs in two baskets" approach to his liquid net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Personal Health and Anti-Aging Obsession

Beyond his investments, [[Sam Altmans Investment Strategies and Background | Sam Altman]] is noted for his intense focus on anti-aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. While previously known for an obsession with "the end of the world," evidenced by a property equipped with gas masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, his current emphasis is on longevity.

His anti-aging routine, though perceived as "mostly simple stuff," includes:
*   Eating healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   Regular exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   Sufficient sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   Taking Metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

### Metformin and Longevity

Metformin, a drug primarily approved by the FDA in the 1990s for managing diabetes, works by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This means it helps regulate blood sugar spikes after meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

The connection to longevity stems from observations that individuals, particularly diabetics, taking Metformin often lived longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Research suggests a significant correlation between stable blood sugar levels (preventing large spikes) and an increased lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. These "glucose-limiting" drugs are becoming increasingly popular among biohackers and ultra-[[Rich peoples approaches to health and longevity | wealthy individuals]] seeking to extend their lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

This growing interest among affluent individuals in [[Biotechnology ventures and bold science | scientific advancements]] for health and longevity mirrors historical patterns, where wealthy figures like John Rockefeller and Thomas Edison also meticulously managed their diets and routines to maximize their health, albeit with less advanced scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

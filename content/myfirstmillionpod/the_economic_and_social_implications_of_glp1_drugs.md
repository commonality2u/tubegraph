GLP1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, are emerging as a potentially transformative class of drugs with significant economic and social implications, impacting industries from food to healthcare and potentially reshaping human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

## Mechanism and Effects

GLP1 drugs work by moderating cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. They can help individuals make better decisions regarding consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Initial testing of semaglutide shows it's "amazing" for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Beyond weight management, anecdotal evidence suggests they could aid in solving alcoholism, with some users reportedly drinking 60% less alcohol, and even reducing nail-biting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. The drugs are seen as "scaffolding" to help update human instincts to modern industrial production, where readily available salt, fat, and sugar lead to overconsumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

However, there are downsides: users may experience upset stomachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a> and could lose muscle rather than developing healthy eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Dosage needs to be increased over time, potentially forever, leading to increasing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. The long-term effects of current prescription patterns are still being studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

Another related drug, [[the_role_and_potential_of_metformin_and_other_longevity_drugs | Metformin]], though not in the same category, also shows similar interesting effects and is taken by prominent figures like Sam Altman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

## Economic Implications

The market for GLP1 drugs is considered "enormous" and potentially "the biggest addressable market in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, with the potential for a bigger impact on the real economy than [[ai_and_its_impact_on_various_industries | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Market Size and Cost
GLP1 drugs currently cost between $500 and $1,000 per month out of pocket for most users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Insurance companies typically only cover it for those with diabetes, and often for a limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

### Impact on Industries
*   **Food Companies:** A potential impact is a decline in demand for food, especially from fast-food chains like McDonald's or Arby's, as people eat less and make better dietary choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This could lead to a hedge fund strategy of shorting food stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   **Airlines:** Conversely, airline companies could see increased profits as passengers weigh less, reducing fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** US healthcare is described as the "most disruptable business in the world," a $3.5 to $4 trillion category where four out of five people are unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Obesity-related healthcare costs are estimated at $1.7 trillion annually, encompassing issues from knee replacements to cardiac problems and cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Widespread adoption of GLP1 could drastically reduce obesity and associated illnesses, potentially leading to a 7% cost cut for the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This could even lead to hospital networks going out of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Pharmaceutical Companies:** Reduced obesity-related conditions could question the necessity of certain other medications, for example, impacting companies like Moderna if the general population becomes healthier and less vulnerable to viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

### Investment Perspective
Investing in the intersection of [[impact_of_ai_and_future_trends | AI]] and healthcare is seen as a prime opportunity for credentialed entrepreneurs who can raise money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Despite the challenges of regulation and insurance in healthcare, the sheer amount of money in the category makes it an attractive "carcass so tempting, so bloated, swimming so slowly" for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. The US spends $13,000 per person on healthcare yet has worse health outcomes than countries like the UK, which spend half as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## Social and Health Implications

### Addressing Obesity and Related Conditions
Obesity is a major public health crisis, with 40% of America being obese and 70% being obese or overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. It's linked to serious health issues like diabetes, increased risk of depression, and suicide, particularly in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. During the pandemic, obesity was a significant comorbidity in mortalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. The conversation around obesity has been politicized, with some segments denying it's a health issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. GLP1 drugs offer a direct way to address this epidemic.

### Societal Impact on Instincts
Beyond physical health, GLP1s could help individuals moderate various cravings and compulsive behaviors driven by outdated biological instincts that are not adapted to modern abundance, including excessive alcohol consumption, pornography use, and addiction to social media affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

### Accessibility and Social Dynamics
Currently, the primary drivers of GLP1 sales are perceived to be [[rich_peoples_approaches_to_health_and_longevity | affluent individuals]] aiming to lose "the last 10 or 20 pounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The highest societal benefit would come from reaching poor and middle-income households struggling with obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. The public nature of prescription pickups at pharmacies, where staff announce the drug name and cost, also highlights a lack of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

GLP1 drugs represent a significant [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business opportunity]] and a potential game-changer for public health and economics. Their ability to address widespread obesity and related health issues, coupled with their potential to influence broader behavioral patterns, marks them as a critical area for future development and investment. The challenge lies in ensuring equitable access and managing the broader societal shifts they may induce.

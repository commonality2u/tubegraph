Jason Fried, the co-founder of 37signals, has built his company into a self-funded "cash cow" by challenging traditional business playbooks. 37signals, known for products like Basecamp and Hey, reportedly makes tens of millions in annual profit and has been profitable for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. According to investor Jason Lin, 37signals is one of the two greatest self-funded cash flow companies he's ever seen, alongside Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Fried's [[entrepreneurial_mindset_and_societal_shifts | entrepreneurial mindset]] is defined by a unique approach to planning, goal-setting, and product development, which often goes against conventional wisdom.

## Anti-Long-Term Planning

Fried views long-term planning as a "fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. He believes that plans made months ago become irrelevant because they reflect past thoughts, not current reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Instead of adjusting an old plan, he advocates for continuous adjustment and "making it up as you go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

37signals operates by thinking in six-week increments, constantly paying attention to current reality to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## No Goals, Just Profitability

37signals famously does not set goals, a philosophy inspired by Jim Koudel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Their only company goal is to be profitable on a given year, a feat they have achieved for 25 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Fried believes that setting goals, especially personal ones, can lead to unhappiness if they're based on who you are when you set them, rather than who you become when you reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He argues that striving for "best work all the time" is more effective than setting specific targets, as arbitrary goals can lead to unnecessary disappointment, like running a 6:04 mile when the goal was 6:00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Their financial approach is to ensure they make more money than they spend, viewing the company's finances as "one big pile" rather than scrutinizing individual product metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This focus on high margins and low costs, combined with a diverse customer base of over 100,000 paying users, allows for a "sloppy in a good way" and "comforting" financial state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Business Strategy and Product Development

37signals' product strategy often begins with a philosophical stance on what should exist in the world, followed by an assessment of their team's ability to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Wandering and Six-Week Sprints

Before committing to a new product, 37signals may spend up to six months "wandering around an idea," exploring possibilities without a fixed destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This exploratory phase relies on internal motivation and the "gravity" of good ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. If an idea loses interest, they are willing to "just give up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Once committed, development proceeds in focused six-week chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This flexibility is enabled by their profitability, lack of outside investors, and no board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

For example, their email service Hey didn't start as an email product but evolved from exploring a rethink of their CRM product, Highrise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### The Power of "No"

Fried emphasizes that "no" is a precise instrument, allowing for the full spectrum of possibilities to remain open. In contrast, "yes" is a "blunt force instrument" that implicitly says "no" to many future opportunities, consuming mental share and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. They don't make new products often, and when they do, they aim to "get it right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### Case Study: We Work Remotely Job Board

37signals sold its We Work Remotely job board to [[innovative_business_strategies_and_resilience | Andrew Wilkinson]] (Tiny) for a relatively low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. The sale was part of a strategy to consolidate efforts and go "all in" on Basecamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While the job board now generates significant profit for Tiny (around $4 million annually), Fried acknowledges it was a "very good deal" for Wilkinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Fried expresses regret for selling because it was "the easiest money," built in two weeks and generating $30,000/month with virtually no work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. However, he now owns a small piece of Tiny as an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Insights from Jason Fried's Business Model

### Profit Over Revenue

Fried emphasizes net profit (GAAP basis) over revenue, stating that "you can go broke generating as much revenue as you can imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### Timing, Luck, and Longevity

He attributes much of 37signals' success to timing, luck, and market conditions, admitting they likely couldn't launch the business today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. This recognition reinforces their commitment to maintaining the existing profitable business rather than seeking another "lightning strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. He finds the idea of selling the company "sad" and fears not having something equally fulfilling to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### Interaction with Jeff Bezos

In 2006, Jeff Bezos invested in 37signals, purchasing shares directly from Fried and co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson (secondary sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This money went into their personal pockets, not the business, as a way to take some risk off the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

Bezos was a fan of 37signals' unique approach, having seen Fried speak and noting that his portfolio companies used Basecamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. Fried describes Bezos as incredibly optimistic, intelligent, and having an "unshakable and unbreakable" enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Bezos's investment came with no control, no board seat, and very weak provisions, as he valued 37signals' long-term thinking and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Innovative Business Strategies: "Once" Products

Fried is excited about a new umbrella brand called "Once" (once.com), which aims to bring back the model of buying software rather than renting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. He argues that most software is a rental, where users lose access if they stop paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. "Once" products are a one-time purchase (e.g., Campfire for $299) and include the code, allowing users to modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

Fried contends that many software categories are commodities, but are still priced like luxuries (e.g., companies spending tens of thousands on Slack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. "Once" provides a high-quality, low-price "generic option" that challenges the subscription model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

## Marketing and Pre-Launch Strategy: Founder Letters

Fried is a strong proponent of using "founder letters" on pre-launch landing pages to generate interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. These letters articulate a strong point of view about why the product exists, often highlighting frustrations with the status quo and offering a better way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

He contrasts this with typical landing pages that feature "AI jargon" and only an email signup form, lacking any compelling "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. The key, he argues, isn't just the writing, but "having a point of view that resonates with people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. His goal is to create a narrative that makes readers nod along, leading them to feel, "of course, where's this been my whole life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

## Product Design Philosophy: Hooks vs. Towel Bars

Fried uses the analogy of "hooks" versus "towel bars" to describe good product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>.

*   **Hooks**: Simple, easy to use, hard to screw up, versatile, and don't take up much space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Towel Bars**: Limited in use, easy to misuse, and take up space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

He constantly seeks "hooks" in product design, looking for simple, straightforward solutions that can be used in unintended ways and still work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. His inspiration comes from outside software, from areas like architecture, land, and furniture design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

## Prototyping and Innovation

Fried advises trying "wackier, quirkier stuff first" when prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. This is because teams tend to become more conservative the deeper they go into a project, and the initial phase is the best time to explore radical ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

This approach ensures that "novelties" (differentiated features) are built early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. If left to the end, time constraints and public demands for "normal stuff" will prevent these unique features from being developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

## Financial Management and Risk Tolerance

As an LLC, 37signals pulls out all profits at the end of each year, as they are taxed at a personal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This is possible due to their predictable recurring revenue and low operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

Fried adopts a conservative investment strategy outside the business, primarily focusing on index funds and a few individual companies he knows well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. He prioritizes sleeping well at night and avoiding risks that jeopardize his personal or business stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. His primary source of anxiety related to work is excitement about new ideas, not financial stress or competitive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. He practices "negative visualization," acknowledging that even if the business flames out, they would be okay, having had a 27-year successful run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.

## Growth Strategy

37signals does not engage in paid advertising, having experimented with it but finding it to be "vanity money" that doesn't yield clear returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. Their low price points (e.g., Basecamp max $299/month for unlimited users) make high customer acquisition costs unfeasible compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

Fried states they are not interested in aggressive growth for the sake of a higher sale multiple. Instead, their focus remains on sustainability, profits, and margins, choosing to extract profits for personal investment rather than reinvesting heavily in uncertain growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.

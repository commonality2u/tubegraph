Monish Pab, a billionaire investor known as the "Indian Warren Buffett," shares his journey and insights into successful investing, drawing heavily from the philosophies of [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] and Charlie Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He emphasizes the close relationship between being a successful businessman and a successful investor, noting that both activities utilize the same parts of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

## Monish Pab's Investing Journey

Monish Pab's personal journey into investing was significantly influenced by his father, a quintessential [[Entrepreneurial stories and lessons from highprofile figures | entrepreneur]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. From a young age, Monish and his brother served as an informal "board of directors" for their father's businesses, which often faced financial troubles due to aggressive, over-leveraged growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>. This hands-on experience, even before the age of 12, provided him with "many MBAs" in problem-solving and business survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:12">[02:31:12]</a>.

He gained further practical experience joining his father on sales calls for a gold jewelry manufacturing business in Dubai during his teen years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">[02:37:04]</a>. Monish initially pursued an engineering career in a telecom networking company but became frustrated by the lack of focus on market and customer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. This led him to switch to international marketing, where his engineering background combined with his early [[entrepreneur_success_stories | entrepreneurial]] exposure gave him a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>.

Pab initially never wanted to be an [[Entrepreneurial stories and lessons from highprofile figures | entrepreneur]] due to the trauma of his childhood business experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>. However, his father encouraged him to start his own IT services business, emphasizing the importance of identifying "offering gaps" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:55">[02:59:55]</a>. Monish started his company while still employed, working on his business in the mornings, evenings, and weekends, ensuring a paycheck until the business generated sufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:18">[03:16:18]</a>. He funded his venture with $30,000 from his 401K and $70,000 from credit cards, seeing it as a low-risk move given the available options if it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. This approach highlights his philosophy of minimizing risk, a common trait he sees in great [[entrepreneur_success_stories | entrepreneurs]] and value investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Monish's shift to full-time investing came after selling a portion of his IT business, netting $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>. From 1995 to 2000, this initial investment grew to $13 million, compounding at 70% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:28">[04:24:28]</a>. He then established PAB funds as a "hobby" with friends, adopting [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Buffett's]] performance-fee-only structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. The fund grew from $1 million to $600 million in assets under management by 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This growth was fueled by strong returns (mid-30s annually with no down years) and a unique fundraising strategy: encouraging existing investors to spread the word to friends and family, circumventing SEC solicitation rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Early Life and Business Acumen

Warren Buffett himself started his [[entrepreneur_success_stories | entrepreneurial]] journey at a very young age, demonstrating a keen business sense from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>:
*   **Coca-Cola Sales**: At five or six, he bought Cokes from his grandfather's store for a nickel and sold them for a dime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>.
*   **Racing Tips**: Around 10 or 11, he published "stable boy selections" with horse racing tips at the Omaha racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:35">[02:29:35]</a>.
*   **Discarded Tickets**: He collected discarded pari-mutuel tickets, checking for winning ones thrown out by intoxicated bettors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:35">[02:30:35]</a>.
*   **Pinball Machines**: With friend Don Danley, he formed the "Wilson coin operated Amusement Company" to repair and place pinball machines in barber shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:19">[02:36:19]</a>. They started with minimal capital ($15 for a machine, $3 in parts) and split profits 50/50 with barbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This venture grew to 40 barber shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:15">[02:41:15]</a>.
*   **Rolls-Royce Rental**: They bought a non-running Rolls-Royce for $300, fixed it for $50, and rented it for $100 on weekends for weddings, while using it to drive to high school during weekdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

By age 17, Buffett had accumulated $155,000 (equivalent to about $1.5 million today) and paid for his own college education, telling his father he didn't need an inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. His investing interest was sparked at 11 when he bought his first stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. However, his philosophy was truly transformed at 19 after reading "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham, leading him to study directly under Graham at Columbia Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:38">[02:57:38]</a>.

## Key Investment Philosophies and Lessons

### Investor vs. Businessman Brain
Both investing and business use the exact same part of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] famously said, "I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Investors focus on the 3-5% strategic thinking of a business, while entrepreneurs also handle the 95-97% of "blocking and tackling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. Monish believes that [[entrepreneurial_stories_and_lessons_from_highprofile_figures | entrepreneurs]] are naturally set up to be great investors with a few tweaks, but many investors lack the practical business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>.

### The Power of Brands and Habits (See's Candy & Coca-Cola)
The acquisition of See's Candy was a transformative lesson for Buffett and Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Despite initially paying three times book value (which they found hard to swallow at the time), See's taught them about the power of brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] would routinely raise See's prices by 10-15% annually, far above inflation, observing no customer resistance and even increased volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This insight, that a strong brand could command pricing power and generate significant free cash flow with minimal additional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, directly led to Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Coca-Cola. While See's didn't travel well geographically, Coke's ubiquitous global presence and "no taste memory" made it a much larger "home run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Patience and Inactivity
The single most important trait for a great investor is **patience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Buffett uses a baseball analogy: "In investing, there are no called strikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Investors can wait for the "fat pitch" when "eight moons line up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The key to "moving the needle" is often *inactivity* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Buffett's analysis of his 58 years running Berkshire showed only 12 decisions truly moved the needle, highlighting a 4% hit rate for the "god of investing." The important thing was not just the "buy decision" but the "paint drying decision" â€“ holding onto great businesses for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### "Heads I win, tails I don't lose much" (Asymmetric Bets)
This philosophy, also known as "dhandho," involves seeking [[Examples of great investment opportunities | opportunities]] where the odds are heavily in your favor, with high upside and limited downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Monish Pab applies this in his own career, such as starting his business with minimal personal risk due to a clear exit strategy (returning to his old job with a promotion) and bankruptcy laws at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### "Trouble is opportunity"
Quoting John Templeton, Monish Pab emphasizes that investors should "be fearful when the world is greedy and...be greedy when the world is fearful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This leads him to look for "hated and unloved" industries or companies, as these are often where mispricings occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Unique Investment Success Stories

### The Patel Motel Owners
A remarkable example of [[entrepreneurial_success_stories | entrepreneurial success]] and a deep understanding of low-cost production is the Patel community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Expelled from Uganda in the early 1970s by Idi Amin, these stateless refugees arrived in the US with little, but their inherent [[Success Stories and Lessons in Entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial]] spirit and frugal nature led them to dominate the motel industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. They would buy small motels, live in two rooms, fire all staff, and operate the entire business themselves (cooking, cleaning, front desk, laundry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This near-zero labor cost allowed them to offer lower nightly rates, achieving 100% occupancy while competitors struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. They then leveraged their success to help family members acquire their own motels, leading to their ownership of roughly 70% of all motels in America and expansion into other labor-intensive businesses like 7-Elevens and Dunkin Donuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Charlie Munger himself advised his friends in the motel business: "don't ever ever try to compete with a Patel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Ajit Jain's Insurance Genius
Ajit Jain, hired by Berkshire Hathaway in 1985 despite having no prior insurance experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, built an insurance business worth over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. He epitomizes the "no called strikes" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Charlie Munger considered his hiring the single best investment Berkshire Hathaway ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Jain would often "take a pass" on writing super catastrophe insurance (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes) for many years if the rates offered were too competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. However, in specific years, he would seize [[Examples of great investment opportunities | opportunities]] to write policies with massive payouts (e.g., $15 billion) for enormous premiums (e.g., $5 billion) when others were hesitant, resulting in significant profits with minimal payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Monish Pab's Rakas Investment
In 2019, Monish Pab invested $8 million for a one-third stake in Rakas, a Turkish warehouse operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He found the company trading at a $16 million market cap despite having a liquidation value of $800 million, due to pervasive market fear surrounding Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Rakas owned 12 million square feet of inflation-indexed warehouses, leased to blue-chip clients like Amazon and Mercedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This "outlier cheap" valuation, combined with high trading volumes, allowed him to acquire a significant stake. Since then, the value of the business has continued to grow, despite the collapse of the Turkish Lira, with Monish treating it like the Walton family treats their Walmart stock â€“ holding it for the long term due to its strong underlying business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on Modern Investments and Leaders

### Index Investing
For the "overwhelming majority of humans," probably more than 99%, buying a low-cost index fund is the best [[Investment strategies and experiences | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The US equity markets are efficient, and frictional costs for ETFs are extremely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This approach leverages the power of compounding without needing special talent or patience for active investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Compounding and the Rule of 72
Compounding is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The "Rule of 72" is a simple mathematical shortcut to estimate how long it takes for an investment to double: divide 72 by the annual rate of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The three variables that matter are starting capital, annualized rate of return, and the length of the runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Starting early and maintaining consistency, even with low returns (e.g., 10% annually), can lead to massive wealth over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Bitcoin and Crypto
Monish Pab considers Bitcoin to be "outside [his] circle of competence" and believes it will "end badly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. He argues it has no intrinsic value, unlike the dollar, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. He advises most people to "take a pass" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Elon Musk
Elon Musk is seen as an "exceptional allocator of capital" and "beyond human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. His ability to disrupt multiple industries, create tremendous value and jobs, and extract maximum potential from people and capital (due to exceptional hiring) is highly respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Mark Zuckerberg and Meta
Mark Zuckerberg's pivot at Meta from a "spendthrift" to a "Patel" (frugal, low-cost producer) was remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Monish notes that while great businesses are often sloppy, Meta's newfound "tightfisted" approach makes its capital allocation "excellent now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## The Wisdom of Charlie Munger

Monish Pab developed a deep friendship with Charlie Munger, whom he describes as "one of a kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### "Be a Harsh Grader" of People
Buffett advises being a "harsh grader" of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He suggests identifying a few exceptional individuals to bring into your inner circle and treating the rest, including those you have no opinion on, "just like the useless humans" by excluding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This is because hanging out with people better than you makes you better, while associating with those worse than you makes you worse. Loyalty should not compromise this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. There is an infinite supply of good humans, so there is no penalty for excluding someone good you haven't figured out, but there is a significant cost to including a "substandard" or toxic person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Givers, Takers, and Matchers
Drawing from Adam Grant's book "Give and Take," Monish highlights three types of people:
*   **Takers**: Extract whatever they can from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Matchers**: Do math in their heads, reciprocating equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Givers**: Selflessly help others without concern for return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

Monish stresses the importance of seeking out givers and, more importantly, *being* a giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. He notes that when you are a giver, "the universe conspires to help you," as seen with Buffett and Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Charlie Munger's Legacy
Charlie Munger's desired gravestone epitaph was "I tried to be useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Monish attests that Munger selflessly helped [[the_art_of_investing_and_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] (without whom Berkshire Hathaway would not exist), as well as individuals and institutions he was involved with, always giving "the better deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Even in his final days, Munger was working to finalize a grant to a non-profit and buying stock, extracting "everything he could from his mind and his body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Munger was also known for his stoicism, facing potential complete blindness with the simple response, "I'm going to have to learn Braille" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

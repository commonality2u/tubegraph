Kevin Rose, an "internet OG," has a diverse career spanning entrepreneurship, venture capital, and angel investing. His journey is marked by a consistent theme of exploration and building things that don't yet exist, leading to both significant successes and learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Ventures

Rose's entrepreneurial path includes founding multiple companies and projects, many of which he started because he saw a gap in the market or a need he wanted to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He notes that of the 10 to 15 businesses he's started, about 90% "go to zero," with a few becoming quite large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Key ventures include:
*   **Dig** Launched in 2004, Dig was an original link aggregator and a "cultural phenomenon" that garnered 38 million monthly users at its peak in early 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Its success led to connections with figures like Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, and Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Watchville / Hodinki** Rose created Watchville, an aggregator app for watch content, because existing watch sites were not mobile-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. He merged Watchville with Hodinki, a watch blog founded by Ben Clymer, and became CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Hodinki grew from $1.5-2 million in annual revenue to over $100 million, largely driven by e-commerce and partnerships with watch brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **Revision3** A media company co-founded by Rose, Revision3 was sold to Discovery Channel's digital arm for $35 million around 2008, marking his biggest company sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Zero Fasting App** This app saw slow but consistent growth initially, then exploded to over a million monthly active users when intermittent fasting gained mainstream popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Oak Meditation App** Another niche app focusing on meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Proof** His most recent venture, Proof, launched about 10 months prior to the interview and focuses on NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. It has achieved hundreds of millions of dollars in NFT sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Experiences

[[investment_strategies_and experiences|Kevin Rose's investment journey]] shifted from founder to investor, especially after Dig's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. He received seed money from investors who bought some of his Dig stock, giving him capital to start making small angel investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Angel Investing**: This has yielded the "best financial returns" for Rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **Twitter**: He became a seed investor in Twitter by purchasing stock from an engineer who was leaving the company, a deal which was notably cheaper than later valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. He recognized Twitter's potential due to its "following" model, which eliminated the need for bi-directional friendships and allowed for celebrity adoption and ease of use via text messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.
    *   **Square**: He invested in Square's seed round after promoting a prototype of their product, which generated significant interest and led to an investor dropping out, creating an opening for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
    *   **Facebook**: He invested in Facebook at a slightly later stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He was struck by Mark Zuckerberg's maturity and deep thinking at a young age, particularly his willingness to admit when he didn't know something and surround himself with smarter people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.

*   **Venture Capital**: Rose is a partner at True Ventures, where he is required to invest a percentage of his own money into the fund, considering it his "bucket of risk" for high-risk, early-stage investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. He was also a partner at Google Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Personal Investment Philosophy

Rose emphasizes a "super vanilla" approach for the majority of his personal portfolio, aside from his venture capital commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Approximately 80% of his non-venture holdings are in low-cost Vanguard index funds across various markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>.
*   **Fixed Income**: He invests in T-bills, particularly when short-term rates are high, such as the I-bills earning over 9% mentioned at the time of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.
*   **Crypto**: About 10% of his overall liquid portfolio is in crypto, split equally between NFTs and other digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: He owns property but doesn't actively invest in real estate beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. He sees owning a house with low interest rates as an opportunity to take out capital and invest it in markets with higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

## Investment and Entrepreneurial Insights

Rose's insights stem from a long career of launching and investing in various ventures:

*   **Passion-Driven Ventures**: He has "never created anything because I thought here's an opportunity to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a>. Instead, he's drawn to the creativity and exploration of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.
*   **Knowing When to Pivot or End**: While he doesn't have a strict timeline like [[Kevin Ryans entrepreneurial journey and insights|Kevin Ryan's six-month rule]], he will put a project into "maintenance mode" if the market isn't mature enough, or shut it down quickly if it's "clearly missed the mark" or is merely a "feature not a real product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.
*   **Hiring Strategy for Content**: For ventures like Hodinki, he prioritizes hiring writers with deep, organic passion and technical knowledge for the subject matter (e.g., horology) even if their writing skills are B-plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>. The technical knowledge is harder to teach, while writing can be refined by copy editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>.
*   **Importance of Trust in Commerce**: In content-driven businesses, deep editorial understanding and high-quality writing build trust with readers, which then allows for successful commerce, especially for high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.
*   **Seeking "Blue Ocean" Opportunities**: He enjoys working in emerging fields that are "blue ocean" (uncharted territory) with fewer high-quality entrepreneurs, such as the NFT space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a>.
*   **Excitement for AI**: Rose is bullish on AI, believing it will "change everything" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. He foresees AI destroying the low end of the creative market and eventually enabling 90% of design work through prompt-based interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>. The influx of high-quality engineering talent into AI is a strong indicator of its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>.
*   **Web3 Perspective**: While acknowledging the dogma and silly use cases in Web3, Rose believes in its potential for specific applications, such as provenance and loyalty programs, where immutability and decentralization offer unique advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:45">[01:58:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. He highlights that most users won't even realize they're interacting with NFTs or blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.

    *   **NFTs Beyond Art**: Beyond digital art, NFTs can serve as verifiable proofs of attendance or ownership, enabling loyalty programs or fractional ownership of real-world assets like luxury wines, streamlining transactions and eliminating fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:30">[02:10:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>. They also allow for interoperability of digital assets across different platforms, increasing their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>.
    *   **Decentralization Benefits**: Decentralization ensures that data, such as loyalty program information, persists even if a company goes out of business, allowing other startups to pick up and build upon that public data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Well-being**: Rose emphasizes the importance of mastering one's own mind and finding "personal peace of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:55">[01:38:55]</a>. His meditation app, Oak, and interest in longevity research like rapamycin, are reflections of his personal journey to manage the constant "on" state of an entrepreneurial mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28">[01:44:28]</a>. He invests in longevity studies with figures like Jack Dorsey and Brian Armstrong, viewing it as a philanthropic effort to further science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>.

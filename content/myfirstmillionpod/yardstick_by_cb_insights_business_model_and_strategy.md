## Overview
Yardstick is a new venture by Anan, the founder of [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | CB Insights]], launched approximately 90 days prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>. It operates under the domain yardsti.co <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>. The business aims to provide in-depth, trusted insights into software vendors based on actual buyer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.

## Value Proposition
Yardstick's core offering is to provide insights into what software buyers truly think about their vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. It offers access to thousands of analyst-led conversations with software buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>. These conversations help users quickly understand crucial aspects like pricing, competition, evaluation criteria, and customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. Essentially, it interviews software buyers to gather their direct feedback on specific tools and then summarizes these findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>. This allows prospective buyers to see how others perceive a tool before making a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:03">[02:41:03]</a>.

## Target Market and Pricing
Yardstick primarily targets larger companies, specifically those with around 500 or more employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:02">[05:32:02]</a>. For such companies, selecting the wrong software can be incredibly costly, necessitating extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:03">[06:01:03]</a>. The platform serves two main customer segments:
1.  **Investment Bankers:** Individuals making investment decisions in public or private markets who need to understand customer satisfaction for software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:09">[06:37:09]</a>.
2.  **Software Buyers:** Companies looking to purchase software who can review others' experiences before committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>.

The pricing for Yardstick is notably high-ticket, charging customers around $30,000 to $40,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>. This contrasts sharply with typical affiliate or advertisement-fee models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:02">[04:48:02]</a>. The belief is that this business model could scale to become a $100 million per year enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

## Differentiating from Competitors
Yardstick distinguishes itself from existing software review sites like G2 Crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a> and SoftwareReviews.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:07">[04:45:07]</a> through several key strategies:
*   **Trust and Reliability:** Traditional review sites often suffer from fake or untrustworthy reviews, making it hard for users to determine if the feedback is relevant or authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Yardstick addresses this by hiring analysts to conduct structured conversations, ensuring reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:08">[04:17:08]</a>.
*   **Direct-to-Customer Model:** Unlike competitors that rely on affiliate fees or advertising from software vendors and compete fiercely for SEO rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:02">[04:48:02]</a>, Yardstick directly charges the end-user (the customer) for the valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>. This shifts the revenue focus from advertising to providing direct value to the buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:09">[05:14:09]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Customer Base:** Being powered by CB Insights, Yardstick can readily access and sell into an existing customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>. This provides a significant advantage over new review sites struggling with SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Operational Model
The minimum viable product (MVP) for Yardstick involves interviewing individuals and presenting their transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:05">[03:01:05]</a>. The team, initially consisting of Anan and seven other employees, focuses on asking specific questions to software purchasers from the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:03">[06:16:03]</a>. These questions include who they considered, who they chose, the price paid, likelihood of renewal, and customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>.

This approach is seen as a more scalable and reliable alternative to one-to-one consultation services like GLG, which charges high hourly rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:05">[06:53:05]</a>. Yardstick instead provides access to a multitude of structured interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

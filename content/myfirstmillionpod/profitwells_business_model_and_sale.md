[[patrick_campbell | Patrick Campbell]] successfully bootstrapped and sold his company, ProfitWell, to Paddle for over $200 million. ProfitWell's journey began as Price Intelligently, evolving from pricing software and services to a comprehensive metrics tool focused on [[Fitness Business Models | subscription businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Evolution and Core Offering
Initially named Price Intelligently, the company started by developing pricing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This evolved into a mix of pricing software and services, eventually leading to the creation of a metrics tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. ProfitWell's main goal is to "run and grow subscription businesses automatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The initial insight for ProfitWell's metrics product came when Campbell's team discovered a company preparing for an IPO was inaccurately calculating key metrics like Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This led them to develop a free metrics product that provides financial reporting for subscription and SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Business Model: Freemium with Automation
ProfitWell's [[examinecom_business_model | business model]] is built on a freemium approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. They offered their core metrics product for free by integrating with billing systems like Stripe, Chargebee, and Zuora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This free offering allowed businesses to automatically get all their subscription metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The challenge arose when the market for metrics tools became saturated with over 30 competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. ProfitWell opted for the free route, which helped them grow to 30,000 companies using their service at the time of the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Beyond the free metrics, ProfitWell offered paid services that automatically reduced churn and optimized pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. With the acquisition by Paddle, they expanded their automated services to include taxes and chargebacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## The Acquisition by Paddle
ProfitWell was acquired by Paddle, a payments infrastructure product, for a headline price of $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The company was bootstrapped, meaning [[selling_companies_and_acquisitions | Patrick Campbell]] and his co-founder owned 100% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A significant portion of the sale proceeds was distributed among employees:
*   13 people became millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   30 to 35 people made $6,000 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Approximately 120 current and former employees received some form of consideration from the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Campbell's personal gain from the sale was in the nine-figure range, though he preferred not to specify the exact amount, noting it was a mix of stock and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Prior to the sale, his personal financial situation was relatively modest, with $20,000 in his bank account and a paid-off house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Outlook
Following the acquisition, Campbell plans to reinvest his earnings into new ventures that align with his personal interests and desire for impact, focusing on areas like debt, money in politics, and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. He intends to explore these complex areas, seeking opportunities to [[getting_rich_through_different_business_models | make money while also doing good]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This aligns with his philosophy of "the strenuous life," advocating for continued effort and big swings after achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. His decision to join Paddle was also driven by a desire to learn about the process of a company going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

Campbell notes that wealth amplifies both the best and worst aspects of a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. He uses his own insecurities as motivation, channeling anxiety into productive endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

## Insights from Data and Competitive Intelligence
ProfitWell's extensive financial database, with over $100-120 billion in annual recurring revenue flowing through its system, provided unique insights into various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This data was used to train their algorithms and inform their content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Campbell applied his background in U.S. intelligence (NSA) to competitive intelligence at ProfitWell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. He maintained a competitive intelligence program that involved:
*   Sending "shadow NPS" surveys to competitors' customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>, asking about features they loved or disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   Collecting information from "moles" such as former employees or friendly customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   Analyzing publicly available information like customer lists (from website snippets, case studies, logos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   Building "red team docs" to anticipate potential threats or challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

Campbell found that while competitive data is not ideal for product development, it is highly valuable for marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Companies with competitive intelligence programs typically have better retention and lower customer acquisition costs (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. For example, when ProfitWell discovered competitors struggled with metrics accuracy, they made "accuracy" a core marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This intelligence also allowed them to quickly adapt marketing strategies based on sector performance, such as during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

### Untapped Markets and Opportunities
Campbell identifies several "hidden industries" with significant growth potential, especially for those looking to move quickly into them:

*   **Quilting and Crafts:** This industry is surprisingly large, with quilting alone being a $4.5 billion per year industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The average quilter spends $8,000-$9,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Subscriptions like "Block of the Month" clubs are popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This market benefits from trends like DIY, therapeutic tactile activities, community, and nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Companies like Missouri Star Quilt Company have revitalized towns through their online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. There is an opportunity for digital innovation, especially on platforms like Instagram, where engagement is high in Facebook groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Services for an Aging Population:** Businesses that cater to older audiences tend to have higher retention rates due to their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Campbell highlights "products that prey on baby boomer kid guilt," such as services that simplify communication like Nanograms, which automatically sends postcards from emails or Instagram posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. The aging population also drives growth in industries like old folks' homes and hospice care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Death and Funeral Services:** This market is dominated by a few large companies that own most aspects of the "last mile of your life," from coffins to funeral homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. There's potential for innovation, though existing players make it challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   **Trades Roll-ups:** Industries like plumbing, HVAC, and electrician services are ripe for roll-ups because they are skilled enough to have a moat but not so specialized that they can't be consolidated. Many owners are looking to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

Campbell's general advice for entrepreneurs is to "sell simple things to simple people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. He cautions against creating "cool things for cool people" in bubbles like Silicon Valley, as the highest loyalty and lowest churn often come from selling to demographics like women in middle America aged 30-60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, or focusing on "Bob the mid-level manager" for enterprise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. He advocates for starting with a premium product and then adjusting the price down, rather than starting cheap and trying to raise prices later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Personal Experiments
Campbell is also exploring [[balancing_personal_wealth_aspirations_with_business_growth | unique personal projects]] to continue learning:

*   **Buying and Forgiving Debt:** He is investigating the shadowy debt market, which he finds "crazy" due to its opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. He aims to understand how debt is purchased and sold, with the intention of buying and forgiving it to help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Hostile Takeover of a Publicly Traded Person:** Inspired by Elon Musk's Twitter bid, Campbell is attempting a hostile takeover of Mike Merrill (kmikeym.com), who became the first publicly traded person in 2008 by selling shares in himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. Shareholders vote on Merrill's life decisions, from the color of his glasses to major life choices like moving in with a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Campbell spent about $13,000 to acquire 1,930 shares, representing a significant portion of the total shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. He announced his intentions at a shareholder meeting, aiming to increase the project's value, which has been in a lull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. This experiment provides unique insights into corporate governance and community dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.
*   **Investment in NFTs:** Campbell, along with his "milk portfolio," made a coin flip decision to purchase a CryptoPunk instead of a Bored Ape, which turned out to be a less profitable investment in the short term as Ape prices surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. This highlights the volatile nature of the NFT market.

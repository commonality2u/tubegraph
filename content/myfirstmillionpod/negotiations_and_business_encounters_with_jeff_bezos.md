Jason Fried, co-founder of 37signals, recounted his experiences and [[business_acquisition_strategies | business encounters]] with Jeff Bezos, who made a secondary investment in 37signals around 2006 or 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>.

## The Investment

Bezos's investment was a "secondary thing" where he bought shares directly from Jason and David, meaning the money went into their pockets and not into the business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:20">[02:17:20]</a>. This was done to "take a little bit of risk off the table" as their product, Basecamp, was only two years old at the time, and they wanted to have "something to show for it personally" if the industry faced sudden changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:27">[02:17:27]</a>. This infusion also provided confidence to "go for it" with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:46">[02:17:46]</a>.

Bezos discovered 37signals because several companies he was invested in used Basecamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>. He also saw Jason Fried speak at a conference in San Diego in 2005, where Fried's "very different" point of view resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:59">[02:54:59]</a>. Fried noted that Bezos was "a fan of people think differently about how to run a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:33">[02:57:33]</a>.

The deal's valuation was "ridiculous," even acknowledged by Bezos himself, though specific details were not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. A key condition from Fried and his partner was that Bezos would not have any control or a board of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:04">[02:41:04]</a>. There was a weak provision that after five or seven years, Bezos's team would have a "right to do something" like "encourage us to do something that we might not have wanted to do," such as [[selling_companies_and_acquisitions | selling]] or going public, but they lacked the power to enforce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. Bezos liked that Fried and his partner were "long-term thinkers" and intended to remain in the business "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:58">[02:46:58]</a>.

### Bezos's Personality and Approach

Jason Fried described Bezos as the "most optimistic person I've ever met," possessing an intelligence "made it with optimism" that is "unshakable and unbreakable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. Bezos is characterized by a "can do this just positivity" and "an enthusiasm about him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>.

Fried recalled demonstrating Campfire, their early chat tool, to Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:23">[02:24:23]</a>. Within 15 seconds, Bezos "just got the whole damn thing" even "more than we got it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:37">[02:39:37]</a>. Fried noted Bezos's genuine curiosity and interest, stating that "when you talk to him it's not that way of he is genuinely curious and interested in what you have to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>.

Another anecdote, shared by the interviewer (not Fried's direct experience), highlights Bezos's unique decision-making. In this story, when offered breakfast, Bezos chose "potatoes with bacon and occup OC ocupas" because "you're the octopus that I'm having for breakfast... when I look at the menu you're the thing I don't understand the thing I've never had and I must have breakfast ocupas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>.

### The Outcome

For Bezos, the investment proved lucrative; as a member of the LLC, he receives annual distributions and has "made his money back many times over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. Fried indicated that it's been a "great investment for him not like a massive exit but like it pays for a lot of things I'm sure it's it's real cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:59">[03:03:59]</a>.

Special situations investments, particularly in [[the_success_and_challenges_of_venturebacked_st artups | venture-backed companies]], present a unique opportunity in the current market. These situations arise when businesses with strong fundamentals are hampered by misaligned capital structures or investor expectations, rather than inherent operational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

## The Opportunity in Distressed Venture Assets
A significant opportunity exists in a specific class of [[the_success_and_challenges_of_venturebacked_startups | venture-backed companies]], particularly those that raised substantial capital in 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. These companies can appear to be "distressed" not because their core business is failing, but because their capital structure, or "cap table," is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

### Characteristics of these Businesses
*   **Strong Revenue and Growth:** A typical example might be a business generating $10 million in annual revenue and growing at 30% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Overcapitalization:** Despite strong performance, these companies often raised excessive amounts of funding, sometimes as much as $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives:**
    *   **Founders:** Due to a high "pref stack" (preferred stock stack), founders might find themselves in a position where they will not make any money, despite the business's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Venture Investors:** Venture investors, who typically seek fund-returning investments, may not see sufficient returns from these companies given their capital outlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **"Worthless Asset" Paradox:** A company might be a fundamentally "great asset" but, due to its cap table, is effectively "worthless" to its current investors and founders in terms of desired returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Waste of Venture Returns:** This situation is seen as a "weird kind of vestige" of periods with exceptionally high venture returns, leading to "waste" in the form of $10 million, $20 million, or $30 million annual revenue companies that aren't generating profit for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

### Addressing the Discrepancy
The strategy for these special situations involves acquiring these businesses at a lower cost than otherwise possible due to their complex incentive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. The goal is to restructure the ownership to create a scenario where:
*   Founders gain a significant stake (e.g., from 10% to 30%), allowing them to run the business profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   Venture investors can divest themselves of non-returning assets that consume their time and resources (e.g., board responsibilities, audits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

This approach creates a "win-win" where [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | everyone is better off]] because the puzzle of misaligned incentives is unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. This contrasts with traditional distressed businesses where the underlying operations are typically broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

Tiny, a company known for its [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | investment strategies and venture creation]], has successfully executed these types of deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Initially, Tiny found opportunities in bootstrapped businesses, which were once considered a "special situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Jeremy is particularly interested in pursuing more of these "special situations" personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

When launching a new [[building_a_successful_startup | business]], the challenge of acquiring the first 100 customers is a critical "step one" that determines future momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Unlike scaling to millions in revenue, the initial phase requires specific, often unconventional, strategies to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Initial Customer Acquisition

### 1. Piggybacking on Existing Platforms

Leverage platforms where your target audience already congregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

*   **Craigslist for Roommate Matching**
    *   For a roommate matching service (Bunk), individual ads for single rooms were created on Craigslist, complete with HTML and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   These ads directed prospective tenants to a website and led to hosting events at apartments, where people could team up to find a place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
    *   This method generated up to 10,000 weekly users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
    *   This approach is similar to how Airbnb initially gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Craigslist for Niche Communities**
    *   To start a business book club, an ad was placed on Craigslist, resulting in 10,000 email sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. This acts as a "magnet" by selectively attracting a niche audience interested in biographies and business books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

### 2. Direct Sales and Risk-Free Offers

Engage directly with potential customers to refine your pitch and make it easy for them to say yes.

*   **"Floor-to-Floor" Sales for a Sushi Delivery Service**
    *   Rather than traditional advertising, a sushi delivery-only restaurant initially went "floor-to-floor" in skyscrapers to reach a high density of potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
    *   The strategy involved identifying the front desk or office manager as a "local influencer" who could facilitate bulk orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
    *   A risk-free offer was presented: "We'd love to bring you a sample tray just for you and you can invite a couple people in the office to try it out for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
    *   This method led to profitability in the first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **"No-Risk Offer" for Biotech/Clean Energy**
    *   For a biotech company converting underground coal into natural gas using microbes, the challenge was finding landowners willing to host the unproven technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
    *   The solution was to target owners of "stranded coal" (uneconomic to mine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
    *   The offer was "we will do this all at our cost... cost you nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>. If it worked, the company would share in the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. This approach leverages "excess capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>.
    *   Similar no-risk offers have been used by businesses like Alex Hormozi's Gym Launch (increasing sales for a percentage of incremental revenue) and Main Street (R&D tax credits for a percentage of savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. This strategy helps new companies overcome the lack of relationships and track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

### 3. Creating Marketable Content

Generate content that is highly shareable and relevant to specific audiences.

*   **"Made to Stick" Infographics for Roommate App**
    *   Inspired by the concept of "niches make riches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>, infographics like "The Typical Roommates of San Francisco" were created for various launch cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
    *   These infographics, based on Yelp reviews and local insights, featured humorous descriptions of different neighborhood archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
    *   By tagging local restaurants and stores, the content encouraged sharing among residents who found it relatable, leading to 100,000 users and features in local newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
*   **Blogging for Event Promotion (Hustle Con)**
    *   For a conference series, blog posts about each speaker were published on Priceonomics (a popular blog at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>.
    *   These articles were then shared on platforms like Hacker News and Reddit, driving initial traffic of 1,000 to 5,000 visitors per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.
    *   Emails were collected via pop-ups, and subsequent blog posts were dripped to the email list, encouraging further sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.
    *   Speaker-focused articles, written to make them look like "heroes," were shared internally within their companies, boosting attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>. This resulted in 10,000 email subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

### 4. Engaging Niche Communities ("Pissing in the Pond")

Instead of targeting the broad "mass market," focus on small, hyper-obsessed communities for initial traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

*   **E-commerce Brand in Facebook Groups**
    *   An e-commerce brand targeted Facebook groups dedicated to comparing products in its niche (e.g., 5,000 members) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of directly pitching, the founders shared the personal story of starting the brand, including "ups and downs," "screwed" moments, and naivety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>.
    *   This vulnerability garnered support, leading to significant revenue in the first month with minimal ad spend, as these "hyper-obsessed" initial customers spread the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:03:00">[37:03:00]</a>.
*   **Event Stunts for App Downloads (Beer Hunt)**
    *   For a "FourSquare for beers" app, the team attended a craft beer tasting festival in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>.
    *   They dressed in Octoberfest attire and created a branded scavenger hunt for attendees to complete while exploring the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>.
    *   Participants submitted their cards with email addresses to win a prize, yielding 1,400 leads of highly engaged craft beer enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>. This generated the first 700 app downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>.

### 5. Building in Public and "David Blaine" Spectacles

Create a narrative around your [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | startup journey]] that draws an audience, especially when there's a clear goal and stakes involved.

*   **The "Personal Story Tactic" for Agency Launch (Shephard)**
    *   For a new agency (Shephard), the founder announced its launch on Twitter, generating curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>.
    *   A newsletter post then shared a personal story about a previous business struggle with profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.
    *   The story detailed how hiring overseas talent transformed profitability, positioning the new agency as a solution based on personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>.
    *   This approach, focusing on the problem and vulnerability, achieved an 11% click-through rate on the newsletter, significantly higher than typical ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:05]</a>.
*   **"Calling Your Shot" / "David Blaine Method" (Milk Road)**
    *   For a crypto newsletter (Milk Road), a "stunt" was used: putting $1 million in a public crypto wallet with the goal of turning it into $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>.
    *   This creates a storyline with a hero, goal, obstacle, and stakes, making the journey inherently entertaining for subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>.
    *   Even losing money can be entertaining, driving subscriptions to witness the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.
    *   This aligns with the "build in public" trend, where companies like Buffer and ConvertKit share internal metrics like salaries and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>.

### 6. Leveraging Existing Audiences (Audience-First Launchpad)

If you already have an audience or reputation, you can leverage it for pre-sales and initial customer acquisition.

*   **Pre-sales for Research Newsletter (Trends.co)**
    *   For a paid research newsletter (Trends.co), a short Gumroad page (400 words) was created, telling a story about identifying market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:36:00">[45:36:00]</a>.
    *   Facebook ads were run against this page, generating $60,000 in pre-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.
    *   The initial customers (100-2000 users) were acquired by emailing the 300 most engaged users from an existing 1 million-subscriber email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>.
    *   Follow-up phone calls with these early adopters informed the development of the first product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:00">[47:06:00]</a>.
    *   This strategy helped the product reach $400,000-$500,000 in monthly sales within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:36:00">[47:36:00]</a>.
    *   Even without a large audience, reputation can be used, as seen with Hampton, where cold emails on LinkedIn and DMs on Twitter were used to acquire customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>.

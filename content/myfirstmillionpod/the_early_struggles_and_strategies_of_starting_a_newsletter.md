Austin Reef, co-founder of Morning Brew, began the company while studying at the University of Michigan with Alex Liberman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially, the project wasn't even called Morning Brew; it was a "PDF attached to an email" that Alex Liberman had named "market corner," which was "way more markets based, way more Finance oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Founding in College

Austin and Alex were students at the University of Michigan when they began their newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Alex was two years older than Austin, which Austin believes was a significant factor in their eventual [[the_growth_and_strategy_behind_morning_brew | success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In 2015, companies like BuzzFeed and Vice were raising substantial venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, Morning Brew didn't pursue that path because Austin was a sophomore in college, and "no one was going to fund a sophomore in college" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

After Alex spent 14 months working at Morgan Stanley and Austin experienced a summer in Investment Banking, both realized they disliked the corporate finance world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Austin decided to commit to Morning Brew full-time, reasoning that the worst outcome would be returning to finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. His parents were initially hesitant about him not finishing college, but they agreed to let him pursue Morning Brew for a year or two after he graduated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Early Product & Challenges

Austin noted that in the early days, they were "too dumb" to expand into areas like video content, focusing solely on their newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. They would sometimes finish writing and coding the newsletter themselves at 2 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

Early growth was "scrappy." They acquired their first few thousand emails by standing in lecture halls at the University of Michigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Austin would pitch the newsletter for five minutes during the 10-minute break between classes, then walk around with an Excel document, "star[ing] them in the eyes until they gave me their email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. He would then manually type these emails into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. This method helped them reach 10,000-15,000 subscribers at Michigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. They then replicated this process at other universities like Penn State, Miami, and NYU, eventually reaching 50,000 college student readers nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

The early team was extremely lean; for the first 1.5 years, employees had to bring their own computers and there was no health care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. They were against taking venture capital, preferring to make "every penny count" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. Fridays at 3 PM, the entire team would stop work to pack envelopes with stickers and t-shirts for their referral program, forming an assembly line to prepare shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

## Sales and Growth Strategies

The initial ad sales model was direct response, featuring brands like Casper Mattress and Away Luggage. They charged based on performance, guaranteeing clicks and conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Moving to New York City opened up a new world of media buying and large ad agencies with huge budgets, far exceeding the initial direct-response campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Austin received a $1 million RFP (Request for Proposal) from the CMO of Discover while still in college, despite the company being worth less than $100,000 at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This taught him that advertising in this space is heavily "relationship driven" and often not based on direct logic or fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Morning Brew's strategy was to be "general business" and pursue scale, while The Hustle, with its "edge" and focus on entrepreneurs, had more opportunities for subscriptions and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Morning Brew ultimately chose a horizontal growth path, launching multiple newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. They found success in the B2B newsletter space, where they could launch newsletters that were profitable even before hiring writers, by pre-selling ad space to B2B SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Austin attributes his strong operational ability and understanding of financial models to his undergraduate business degree and Investment Banking internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. He could see how simple it was in an Excel model: growing by 50,000 subscribers per month without significant cost increases would lead to millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. He and Alex were maniacally focused on key metrics, notably their "Great Wall of Opens," where they tracked their open rate daily for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Austin emphasizes the importance of founders knowing "the main thing" for their business and constantly monitoring its core metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

## Competition and Market Landscape

Morning Brew and The Hustle were direct competitors, constantly comparing themselves. Austin initially "hated" The Hustle, viewing them as an "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. He believed having an enemy was beneficial for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Alex Liberman would print out both newsletters daily and review them "line by line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

After both companies sold, Austin and The Hustle's co-founder, Sam, became friends, realizing their previous animosity was akin to "sports opposing sports teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Austin categorizes newsletters into three types:
1.  **Editorial Newsletters**: Long-form, like Substackers (e.g., Packy McCormick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
2.  **Aggregation Newsletters**: General business, aiming for scale (like early Morning Brew and The Hustle), or niche aggregations ("morning brew for X") like The Milk Road (for crypto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. He sees the latter as the biggest opportunity, especially in growing industries where one can "own that and build a brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
3.  **Classic Bullet-Point Newsletters**: Brief, like "five bullet Friday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

For consumer-focused newsletters, Austin advises targeting "high dollar" audiences, such as "the newsletter for Ferrari owners or the newsletter for Rolex owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. B2B is also a strong area, emphasizing the need to "treat B2B like consumer" by making content more engaging and treating professionals like people, not just job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

Austin believes that receiving an early win in life is crucial, as it builds "swagger," "confidence," and a "brand" that opens doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. He also highlights the importance of surrounding oneself with smart, inexperienced individuals who are hungry to learn and build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Many early Morning Brew employees were entrepreneurial, drawn by the pitch of being "in on the ground floor" of a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

Austin, reflecting on the sale of a portion of Morning Brew for approximately $70 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, advises taking "half your chips off the table" when given the option, especially if it means life-changing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. He feels it's important to maintain enough upside to stay excited, but also have security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. He also advocates for investing the majority of newfound wealth conservatively, in "very boring stuff" like the S&P 500, rather than making impulsive splurges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Austin has a "barbell" approach to his career: either passive income with minimal work (20-25 hours/week) or going "Allin" on a business with potential for "multiple billions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. He is not interested in "doubles" (moderately successful businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. His definition of wealth is "all about time" â€“ having the freedom to spend his time as he wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

Austin identifies two key strategies for entrepreneurs in challenging economic times:
1.  **Help companies save money**: Capital is no longer abundant, so businesses prioritize cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. Examples include outsourced talent agencies (like his co-owned business, Oceans, which finds talent in Sri Lanka) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a> or niche marketplaces for specific services (e.g., content marketing for B2B companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.
2.  **Help individuals earn side income**: People are trading their time for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.

He sees significant opportunity in "morning brew for X" in the AI space, suggesting an AI newsletter or a holding company that invests in and acquires small AI side projects to cross-promote and bundle their marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. However, he acknowledges the challenge of durability in the rapidly changing AI landscape, as new models or consolidated apps could quickly make existing tools obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. He is skeptical of investing in companies that solely build on top of Open AI, as they lack unique long-term differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.

Sabri Suby, a marketing agency founder and Shark Tank Australia personality, discusses various business growth strategies, emphasizing the role of affiliate marketing and performance-based compensation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach often involves offering "Godfather offers"â€”propositions so compelling that businesses would be foolish to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Performance-Based Partnerships

A key strategy involves reaching out to businesses already successfully utilizing one traffic channel (e.g., Google Ads) but neglecting others (e.g., Facebook Ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The offer is to build the entire new channel funnel, run ads, and manage everything for free, in exchange for a percentage of the sales generated from that specific new traffic channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This eliminates risk for the business and focuses on proven results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This model can be applied across various platforms, such as launching TikTok ads for businesses focused solely on Meta ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Similarly, e-commerce stores operating on platforms like Shopify but not yet on Amazon represent a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A simple pitch involves demonstrating competitors' success on Amazon and offering to manage the entire Amazon setup and sales process, taking a percentage of the sales, with the client only needing to supply the products from their warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This targets businesses with existing revenue but lacking the time or expertise for channel expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Leveraging Affiliate Commissions for SaaS Products

Another impactful strategy centers on using the affiliate commissions offered by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The rising cost per thousand impressions (CPM) on platforms like Facebook is increasing the customer acquisition cost (CAC) for many SaaS companies, extending their payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for those who can deliver customers with a lower CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Many SaaS platforms offer substantial affiliate commissions:
*   **HubSpot:** Offers 30% recurring commission for up to one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. For an $800/month Marketing Hub plan, this can be approximately $2,880 per customer over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Hyros:** Reportedly pays a minimum of $1,000 and up to $15,000 per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The strategy involves picking a niche (e.g., chiropractors) and building a complete, high-converting marketing funnel specifically tailored for that niche (including opt-ins, email flows, landing pages, and text messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This pre-built "TurnKey funnel" is then offered to businesses in that niche for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The only condition is that the business must sign up for the necessary SaaS product (e.g., HubSpot) through the affiliate's link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This allows for a high volume of customer acquisition for SaaS products by providing significant value upfront to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Live Chat Services on Commission

Another opportunity involves offering live chat services to small businesses that have a Google My Business listing but lack 24/7 customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. By analyzing their Google My Business traffic, one can identify lost opportunities from after-hours inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The offer is to field and nurture these leads, even closing some through chat, in exchange for a 20% commission on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This can start as a solo side hustle and scale by hiring remote staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## The Explosive Growth of TikTok Shop

The rise of social commerce, particularly TikTok Shop, presents a significant opportunity for [[leveraging_internet_platforms_for_business_growth|business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. TikTok Shop allows brands to offer affiliate programs, where creators earn a percentage of sales by tagging products in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Individuals can identify best-selling products on TikTok Shop using tools like Cow Data or Fastmoss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These tools reveal product revenue and the specific viral videos used to sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The unique advantage is that creators do not need to show their face or use their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>:
1.  **Reverse Engineer:** Analyze scripts of top-performing videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
2.  **AI Voiceover:** Use AI tools like Eleven Labs to generate voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
3.  **AI Image Generation:** Create compelling images using AI tools like Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
4.  **Video Editing:** Assemble all elements in a video editor like CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

This method has enabled individuals to earn substantial income, as seen with products like "shilajit resin," which achieved millions in sales via TikTok Shop affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Many successful products on TikTok Shop leverage storytelling and appear organic rather than overtly sales-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

The opportunity is twofold:
1.  **Affiliate Sales:** Directly generate commissions by creating content for products as an affiliate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
2.  **Agency Model:** Approach businesses and offer to build out their TikTok Shop presence, manage creatives, and run campaigns on a retainer basis (e.g., $20,000 per month plus 5% of sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. A key value proposition is generating viral TikToks that can also be repurposed for paid ad campaigns on platforms like Facebook, solving the common bottleneck of creative development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

This strategy allows individuals to get paid while developing highly valuable, horizontal skills such as copywriting, consumer psychology, video editing, storytelling, and viral content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. These "timeless skills" are applicable across any business and are essential for future marketing endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This advice is particularly relevant for those early in their careers who possess hustle and a willingness to learn, even without initial capital or coding skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

## The "Yes, Yes, Yes, No" Funnel

A powerful sales funnel technique is the "yes, yes, yes, no" funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. This involves providing valuable information or content (e.g., a free report, a book like "Sell Like Crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>) that educates the prospect and makes them agree with the strategies presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. By the end, the prospect is convinced of the expertise and the value of the methods, leading them to say "yes, yes, yes" to the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. However, they then acknowledge (implicitly or explicitly) that they lack the time, energy, or skill to implement it themselves, leading to a "no" to DIY and a "yes" to outsourcing to the expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

This approach works because it demonstrates expertise and builds trust without an immediate hard sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. For example, a digital agency might offer a free report on "22 things you need to know when running Facebook ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. This attracts interested individuals, a percentage of whom will realize they need professional help and seek the agency's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. The key is to genuinely provide value and not make the initial free offering a thinly veiled sales pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

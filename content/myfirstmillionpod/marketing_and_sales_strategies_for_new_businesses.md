This article explores various [[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startup_growth | marketing and sales strategies]] and [[tips_for_starting_businesses_and_investment_strategies_for_young_entrepreneurs | business ideas]] for new entrepreneurs, particularly those starting with limited resources or experience. Sabri Suby, a marketing agency founder and Shark Tank Australia personality, shares insights on how to identify opportunities and build successful ventures in today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Launching New Businesses

### The "Godfather Offer" for Channel Expansion
A compelling strategy for businesses involves identifying companies already successful on one traffic channel (e.g., Google Ads) but neglecting others (e.g., Facebook Ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The approach is to propose a "Godfather offer"—an irresistible proposition where you handle all the work (building funnels, running ads) for the new channel without upfront payment, taking only a percentage of generated sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This eliminates risk for the business owner and demonstrates immediate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The key is to target businesses that:
*   Are already profitable in at least one channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Lack the time or expertise to expand to new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Are in an industry where new channel adoption can directly generate revenue, such as e-commerce moving from Shopify to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.

For instance, a Shopify store not on Amazon could be approached with an offer to manage their Amazon FBA setup, taking a percentage of sales, as many competitors are already doing millions on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This is a "no-brainer" because it expands their reach with no upfront cost and clear revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Leveraging Affiliate Programs for Customer Acquisition
Another effective [[business_acquisition_strategies | customer acquisition strategy]] involves becoming an affiliate for high-commission SaaS products (e.g., HubSpot, Hyros) and offering a valuable service for free to secure the affiliate signup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **High Commissions:** HubSpot offers 30-40% recurring commissions for up to a year, translating to potentially thousands of dollars per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Hyros offers $1,000 to $15,000 per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **"Free Funnel" Offer:** For example, build a pre-made, high-converting funnel for a specific niche, like chiropractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Offer this funnel, including landing pages, email flows, and text messages, for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The only catch is that they sign up for the necessary software (e.g., HubSpot) through your affiliate link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Targeting:** Focus on businesses that need sophisticated lead management (e.g., those already running ads but sending traffic to a homepage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This model effectively [[acquiring_first_customers_for_startup_businesses | acquires customers]] for SaaS products by providing a valuable "turnkey" solution to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Providing Live Chat Services for Small Businesses
With 400 million small businesses worldwide, many lack live chat support on their Google My Business listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This represents an opportunity to offer live chat as a service.
*   **Free Trial, Commission-Based:** Offer to manage live chat inquiries, nurture leads, and even close some sales for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Charge a 20% commission on sales generated through the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Targeting:** Focus on businesses that are already receiving significant after-hours traffic on their Google My Business listings but are unable to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This is particularly appealing to businesses that have money but lack time and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Start as a solo operation, then hire virtual assistants (e.g., in the Philippines) to scale the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Harnessing Social Commerce with AI-Driven Content
The explosion of platforms like TikTok Shop and YouTube Shopping creates a massive opportunity for affiliates and content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. This method requires no upfront capital, no need to show your face or use your voice, and can generate substantial income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **TikTok Shop Mechanics:** Brands offer products for affiliates to promote with product tags, earning a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Content Creation without Being a Creator:**
    1.  **Identify Top Products:** Use tools like CowData or FastMoss to find best-selling products on TikTok Shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. These tools show revenue and viral videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    2.  **Reverse Engineer Scripts:** Analyze what makes successful videos go viral by transcribing their scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    3.  **AI Voiceovers:** Use AI tools like Eleven Labs (around $20/month) for professional voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    4.  **AI Image/Video Generation:** Use free AI tools like MidJourney to create compelling visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    5.  **Edit:** Assemble all elements in an editing tool like CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Monetization Paths:**
    *   **Affiliate:** Directly earn commissions from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
    *   **Consulting/Agency:** Offer services to brands to build and manage their TikTok Shop presence, creating viral content and even vetting it for use in other paid ads (e.g., Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. This leverages the unique virality of social media for broader [[the_evolution_of_marketing_strategies | marketing reach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

This strategy helps in learning [[innovative_product_development_and_launch_strategies | copywriting]], consumer psychology, video editing, and social media virality—[[marketdriven_business_growth_and_acquisition_strategies | timeless skills]] that can be applied to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Core Principles for Business Growth

### Focus and Avoiding "Shiny Object Syndrome"
A common challenge for new businesses is a lack of focus, often leading to "shiny object syndrome" where entrepreneurs constantly chase the next new sales channel or business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While focusing on one traffic channel is crucial, businesses should be open to opportunities to expand into new channels if a "Godfather offer" is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Identifying Businesses with a "Bleeding Neck"
When starting out, focus on customers with an immediate, urgent problem ("bleeding neck") that your service can directly solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Prioritize services that contribute to revenue-producing activities, as this is the "oxygen" of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Prioritizing Timeless Skills
When deciding which business to pursue, consider the "half-life" of the skills you will acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Skills like copywriting, understanding consumer psychology, video editing, and storytelling are horizontal and will serve you for decades, unlike platform-specific ad knowledge that changes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. Getting paid to develop these skills early in your career is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

### The Power of Showmanship in Marketing
Showmanship, defined as storytelling, stage presence, energy, and visual storytelling, is the "currency that buys the attention of your prospect and of your marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. In business, particularly in content creation and marketing, bringing drama and excitement to otherwise mundane activities can capture attention and lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. An example shared is an ad campaign that deliberately aimed to be entertaining and fun, featuring a funeral for "murdered ad money," which tripled sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

### Developing Repeatable Sales Systems
Successful businesses don't rely on luck or hoping for referrals; they have a "repeatable, predictable way to actually put a dollar into a machine and turn it into three or five or ten dollars back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. Without such a system, a business is merely an "expensive hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

A basic sales funnel involves:
1.  **Valuable Lead Magnet:** Offer a piece of content (e.g., a free report, video) that gets your target market to "raise their hand" and express interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. This is more effective than immediately asking for a quote or direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
2.  **Godfather Offer:** Once they've engaged with the lead magnet, present a compelling, low-commitment offer (like a free consultation or strategy session) to get them into further communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
3.  **Content-Led Sales:** In e-commerce, successful brands use content that doesn't overtly look like a sales message, sliding under the radar and letting the algorithm optimize for reach. The product pitch is woven into the content later, often after an engaging story or interesting fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

## Personal Philosophies for Success

### Embracing Fun in Business and Life
Early in his career, Sabri believed he needed to appear serious and formal in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. However, he found that embracing more fun in both business and life led to greater success and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. This means:
*   **Injecting Fun into Work:** Deliberately designing marketing campaigns or business activities to be entertaining and enjoyable to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   **Planned Excitement:** Actively planning fun activities, holidays, and new experiences throughout the year, rather than waiting for them to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **"Do Cool S***" Budget:** Allocating time or resources to experimental ideas that might not have a clear ROI but generate excitement and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.

### Conquering the "Little S***" (Self-Doubt)
Suby emphasizes the internal struggle against a "little s***"—the voice of self-doubt that tries to dissuade you from doing hard things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. His philosophy is not just to ignore it but to penalize it for speaking up, making you do *more* of the difficult task as a consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This builds mental resilience and reinforces the commitment to promises made to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

### Planning for Excitement and New Experiences
Many people, as they get older, implicitly believe life becomes more boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. To combat this, intentionally plan new experiences and "big swings" annually, ensuring life remains full of zest and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. Engage in activities that feel like "play" to you but look like "work" to others, which naturally leads to longer engagement and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. An example of this is creating personalized children's stories for travel using AI, making the anticipation of a trip more engaging for his daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

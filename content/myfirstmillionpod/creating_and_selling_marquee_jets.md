Jesse Itzler, a self-described "fascinating guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a> and successful entrepreneur, founded Marquee Jets, a fractional jet ownership company, which he later sold to Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This venture followed his initial success in a jingle company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

## Inception of the Idea
The idea for Marquee Jets arose when Itzler was a guest on a private jet with his business partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. They observed that people were flying privately and wondered about the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Research revealed limited options for private air travel in the 1990s: purchasing a $50 million airplane, committing to a five-year fractional program like NetJets, or chartering with uncertainties about plane ownership or pilot reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Itzler and his partner identified a "little white space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a> for individuals who wanted private flight access for approximately 25 hours a year without the responsibility of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This led to the concept of a 25-hour jet card, functioning like a debit card for flight time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

## Overcoming Initial Hurdles
At 28-29 years old, Itzler and his partner had no aviation experience and limited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Their strategy for building the company involved figuring out how to get from point A to B the fastest, often through partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

### Gaining Access to NetJets
A key challenge was securing a partnership with NetJets, a multi-billion dollar company already owned by Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Itzler had a prior relationship with the president of NetJets, Jim Jacobs, stemming from a favor Itzler did for Jacobs' daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Itzler had secured a spot for Jacobs' daughter as a backup singer in a concert, an act that deeply impressed Jacobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This demonstrated Itzler's philosophy of being a "yes guy" and delivering without expecting immediate return, which later led to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### The "Will vs. Can" Philosophy
During the initial meeting, NetJets executives quickly dismissed Itzler's idea, stating they wouldn't give "two kids access to our 650 airplanes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. However, Jim Jacobs noted that the NetJets President, Rich Santulli, rarely gave anyone 12 minutes, suggesting potential interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

This moment echoed a pivotal lesson Itzler learned earlier in his career from Lou Katz, the father of a friend who let Itzler sleep on her couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. When Itzler considered giving away 10% of his future earnings for $10,000, Katz challenged him: "Will you make this business work without the 10 grand?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The distinction between "can" (capability) and "will" (commitment) became a lifelong theme for Itzler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. It instilled a powerful drive to figure things out as an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### The Focus Group Presentation
Instead of a traditional PowerPoint presentation, Itzler and his partner brought their own focus group to the second meeting with NetJets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Eight individuals, including figures like Carl Banks from the New York Giants and Run from Run DMC, explained that they would never buy a fraction of an airplane but *would* purchase a 25-hour jet card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. This direct demonstration of market demand made a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

Rich Santulli, the NetJets President, saw enthusiasm and a willingness to succeed in Itzler and his partner, despite their lack of aviation experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. He also recognized the value of attracting a younger demographic of athletes, entertainers, and young moguls who could become lifetime customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. This led to NetJets agreeing to give them a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## Business Model and Growth
The initial deal with NetJets involved Marquee Jets leasing time on NetJets' planes, with NetJets carrying the financial risk until a sale was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Marquee Jets essentially operated as a marketing organization, marking up the leased time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

To acquire their first customers, Marquee Jets focused on establishing credibility by attracting athletes, entertainers, and high-profile individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Itzler attended a TED conference in Monterey, California, where wealthy individuals congregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Unable to obtain credentials, he bought all the muffins from a local coffee shop and offered them to attendees who were told the shop was out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. This creative approach led to his first sale: Josh Koppelmann, who owned half.com and was in the market for a private jet card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

Itzler excelled at "servicing the hell" out of his clients, going above and beyond expectations. For example, he provided Josh Koppelmann with a list of pediatricians and made dinner reservations in Mexico when Koppelmann traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. This exceptional service led to referrals, which became the primary growth engine for the business for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

Marquee Jets achieved significant sales, doing nearly $200 million in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. As the company grew, reaching 4,000 members and $1 billion in annual sales, the model shifted, requiring Marquee Jets to start purchasing its own airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.

## Sale to Berkshire Hathaway
Marquee Jets was ultimately sold to Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> through NetJets, which Berkshire already owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. Itzler highlights that the talented team, including individuals like Ken Austin (who later co-founded Avion tequila and Proper No. Twelve whiskey), was exceptional and contributed to building a strong company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

Itzler considers meeting his wife, Sarah Blakely, a customer of Marquee Jets, the "best ROI" of the entire deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

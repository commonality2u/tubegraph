Starting a business can range from straightforward to incredibly complex, with different models presenting unique challenges and opportunities. Understanding these distinctions can help entrepreneurs navigate the landscape of [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | business ideas]] and [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting a business from scratch]].

## The Hardest Businesses

The most challenging businesses often involve physical goods, numerous employees, and brick-and-mortar operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These models come with significant operational complexities and thin profit margins.

### Brick-and-Mortar and Physical Goods
Businesses that require moving physical goods or maintaining a physical location are generally the hardest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

*   **Restaurants and Bakeries**
    *   Operating a bakery, like the one owned in Victoria, BC, demands managing 40-50 employees, coordinating early morning shifts, and dealing with daily operational issues like equipment breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.
    *   A pizzeria, despite seemingly simple ingredients, can still be a "brutal business" due to management issues, incorrect incentives, overspending on build-outs, and labor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The profit margins are often razor-thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
    *   These experiences illustrate how easy it is to "tap out" of entrepreneurship if a difficult business is your first venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

*   **E-commerce (with physical goods)**
    *   An attempt to launch an e-commerce store for cat furniture, "HJ Muse," involved a significant investment of $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
    *   The business struggled with razor-thin margins (2-3% EBITDA compared to 30-50% in an agency) and required constant reinvestment of profits into inventory, ultimately leading to a complete loss of the initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. This highlighted the "brutal" nature of moving physical goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Medium Difficulty Businesses

### Agencies
Agencies, such as Metalab, are categorized as medium difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

*   **Advantages**: They are asset-light, requiring minimal overhead like an office and an internet connection. Staff can generally be hired as needed, reducing initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: The primary difficulty lies in constantly balancing supply and demand. Agencies often experience "feast or famine" cycles and must be prepared to make "radical changes" at short notice if the pipeline of work slows down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. Growth must be carefully managed to avoid ruining company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. They also face pressure from clients who want the same results for less money, while labor costs rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Easy Businesses

The easiest businesses are often those that generate "automatic revenue" with minimal ongoing effort and a digital-first approach.

*   **Digital Products and Themes**
    *   Pixel Union, a business that created Tumblr and later Shopify themes, was initially conceived as a favor for a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   It quickly generated $10,000 a month in revenue, offering the first taste of automatic revenue: sales continued even while the founder was asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This model required no outside capital and was spun out as an independent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

*   **Job Boards (with strong SEO)**
    *   We Work Remotely, a remote job board acquired from Basecamp, is considered the easiest business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
    *   Its success was largely due to strong SEO, ranking number one for "remote jobs" as remote work exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. With minimal investment and a small team, applying "simple best practices" turned it into a very large business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

## Highly Challenging (Software as a Service)

*   **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    *   While many agency owners aspire to own a SaaS company, building a successful one can be incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
    *   The project management software "Flow" illustrates this, where $10 million was lost trying to compete with a competitor (Asana) that had an "unlimited budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. This highlights the brutal reality of fighting against well-funded incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

## Key Takeaways on [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | Starting a Business]]

*   **Learning by Pain**: Experiencing the difficulties of different [[early_business_experiences_and_challenges | business models]] provides valuable lessons about what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Business Valuation**: Understanding how to value a business is crucial. Selling an incredible business for what seemed like a good multiple (14x profit) can be regretted if its growth potential (50% annually) is not fully appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Investing in Knowledge**: A pile of cash after an exit can prompt a deep dive into investing, leading to an "obsessive" study of value investing and related books over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, transforming one from knowing nothing to being a top percentile investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Operator's Advantage**: Being a businessman who understands operations provides a significant advantage as an investor, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of a business beyond just spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Mindset**: Businesses with "potential lasting impact" that can be around for decades, like Aeropress (a way of making coffee), are highly valued, even if they require significant investment or are not traditional internet businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Recognizing a "Verb"**: Products that become verbs (like Google, Uber) indicate a de facto market leader and are often excellent investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **Capital Access**: For [[starting_a_business_with_no_capital | bootstrap businesses]], understanding and accessing different forms of capital (credit, debt for M&A, secondaries) can be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. New models like Tenzing aim to provide this financial guidance to founders who might not speak the language of traditional investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
*   **Aligning Incentives**: It is critical for investors and founders to have aligned incentives. Venture capital models where fund managers earn large fees regardless of investor returns can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   **Independent Conviction**: Do not outsource conviction to "smart money." Even highly successful investors can make "colossal mistakes" or "dumb bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. Diligence should not be assumed based on a big name's involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. Always go in "eyes wide open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

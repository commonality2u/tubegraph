Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and largest shareholder of Hubspot, has a significant background in technology and [[investing_in_tech_startups | startup investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Hubspot is a publicly traded company valued at approximately $25-30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Shah was an early [[examples_of_great_investment_opportunities | investor]] in companies like [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | Coinbase]] and Dropbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His personal net worth is publicly known to be around $850 million, primarily in Hubspot shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Dharmesh's Investment Philosophy
Dharmesh believes that the first approximately $5 million in wealth has a "dramatic impact" on one's life, offering "an inordinate amount of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Beyond this amount, additional money offers progressively less marginal freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. He plans to donate over 90% of his wealth through his wife's foundation, not aiming for a multi-generational dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

A key [[investment strategies and experiences | lesson]] he learned early in his career is the relationship between time and money, noting that people often undervalue their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. He applies an internal "hourly rate" to assess whether an activity is worth his time or if it should be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

His approach to [[investment_strategies_and_decisionmaking_in_startups | evaluating ideas]] involves three factors:
1.  **Profit Potential:** What could the project be if everything went perfectly? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>
2.  **Passion:** How excited are you about it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>
3.  **Probability of Success:** The likelihood of achieving that potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

He emphasizes that people often mistakenly prioritize the probability of success first, discarding ideas too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. Instead, one should consider the "expected value" (profit potential multiplied by probability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

## Focus on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-Based Networks

Dharmesh Shah expresses significant excitement for [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | cryptocurrency]] broadly defined, particularly its [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | application]] to mainstream concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. He specifically discusses the potential for a blockchain-powered professional network.

### The Problem with Current Professional Networks
Platforms like LinkedIn, while good for their time, now face issues such as spam and diminishing utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. There's a constant struggle to separate noise from signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Additionally, it is not always clear who has real value or hierarchy in the network, leading top professionals to ignore it due to being "inundated with crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

### The Vision for a Blockchain-Powered Professional Network
Dharmesh proposes a professional network built on the blockchain, similar to how "Big Cloud" applied blockchain to Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. He even offers to fund a seed round of up to $5 million for such a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Key features and benefits of this concept include:
*   **Individual Currency:** Each user would have their own currency, reflecting their "career worth" or value in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.
*   **Monetization of Attention:** Users could set a price for their attention, e.g., "$10 to open your email" or "$500 to look at your company and apply for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This creates a mutual beneficialness, as the recipient receives revenue, unlike current models where platforms like LinkedIn earn money from spamming users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.
*   **Weighted Graph (PageRank for Professionals):** Unlike current networks where every "follow" or connection has equal weight, a blockchain-based system could incorporate a PageRank-like algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. This means:
    *   The value of an endorsement (e.g., buying someone's coin) would depend on the endorser's own "authority" or coin value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
    *   A "follow" should be replaced by a financial investment (e.g., "buy a dollar, buy five dollars" of a person's coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
    *   This system would inherently display a person's "career worth" within the network, addressing the hierarchy issue on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

Dharmesh describes this as a "tremendous idea" and believes it represents the future of social networks, even if the specific platform (like Big Cloud) may not be the ultimate winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. He has personally invested around a million dollars in "Big Cloud" to understand its mechanics and be on the forefront of this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

### Challenges of Decentralized Platforms
A challenge for decentralized platforms is the absence of a central authority (like a CEO) to "swat down" schemers and scammers who try to game the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>. However, Dharmesh believes in "self-governance over time" and that as "real things" are built using the underlying [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | open protocol]], things will settle down, and people will find use cases that avoid these "dark issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## Other Opportunities and Ideas
Dharmesh is also excited about [[opportunities_in_current_digital_platforms | natural language processing]] (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. He envisions a future where users can simply express their intent to software (e.g., "remove the background" in Photoshop, or "how many new people signed up for our service hub product in the last 90 days" in Hubspot) and the software performs the action without requiring clicks or drags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. He considers this a "mega trend" potentially bigger than mobile, democratizing software use for billions who don't want to learn complex interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.

He highlights "D-Build" (a website builder using GPT-3) as an example of this "magic trick" where a simple text description can generate complex code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

Dharmesh also owns numerous domain names, including "remoteculture.com," which he envisions as a paid community and blog for HR and operations professionals navigating the shift to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. He believes in the "power of building a diagnostic tool" for an industry, as seen with Hubspot's "Website Grader," which helped users realize they needed Hubspot's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

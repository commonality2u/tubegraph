Andrew Wilkinson, known for Tiny, shares his experiences across numerous business ventures, categorizing them by their ease of operation and offering insights into their financial dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His journey highlights the importance of understanding different business models and their inherent challenges and opportunities.

## Easy Businesses

The easiest businesses, according to Wilkinson, often involve digital products or services that generate automatic revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Digital Products (e.g., Themes, Job Boards)

*   **Pixel Union:** This business started as a side project making Tumblr themes, which later expanded to Shopify themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It provided a "first taste of automatic revenue," with sales occurring even while the founder slept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. These types of businesses can achieve high margins, often 30% to 50% EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **We Work Remotely:** Acquired from Basecamp, this remote job board was relatively easy to scale with simple best practices and a small team due to strong SEO and a growing market for remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Medium Businesses

Agencies are considered medium on the easy-to-hard scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Agencies (e.g., MetaLab)

*   **Asset-Light:** Agencies are often asset-light, requiring minimal physical infrastructure like an office and internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Scalability Challenges:** While scalable, agencies constantly balance supply and demand. Rapid growth can ruin company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Feast or Famine:** Agencies can experience periods of feast or famine, requiring owners to be prepared for downturns and radical changes if the pipeline falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Current Market:** In the current economic climate, agencies are experiencing softness, with clients seeking similar outcomes for less money, creating pressure on margins amid rising labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

## Hard Businesses

The hardest businesses typically involve physical goods, brick-and-mortar operations, and a large number of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### Physical Goods / E-commerce

*   **HJ Muse (Cat Furniture):** An attempt to create an online store for stylish cat furniture resulted in a significant loss due to razor-thin margins and the constant need to reinvest profits into inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This taught Wilkinson that moving physical goods is brutal compared to digital businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
*   **Aeropress:** While a successful acquisition, this physical product business, a coffee-making device, relies heavily on retail channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The company aims to increase its online presence to capitalize on new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

### Brick and Mortar (e.g., Restaurants, Bakeries)

*   **Famous Original (Pizzeria):** Wilkinson's foray into the restaurant industry with friends proved "brutal," leading to significant financial losses due to poor management, misaligned incentives, overspending on build-out, and labor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Bakery in Victoria, BC:** Owning a bakery with 40-50 employees highlights the complexities of managing physical operations, such as early morning shifts and the impact of employee sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. The coordination required is significantly more complex than an internet business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

*   **Flow (Project Management Software):** Competing directly with large, well-funded companies like Asana, Wilkinson poured $10 million into Flow and lost it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. This highlights the difficulty of competing with "armies that have unlimited budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
*   **Advantages of SaaS:** Despite the high competitive risk, sticky SaaS businesses are generally more resilient to economic downturns than agencies, as clients are less likely to "rip it out of their company and retrain everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

## New Ventures and Business Ideas

### Tenzing (Modern Investment Bank)

Wilkinson and his partner Chris are launching Tenzing, a modern investment bank aimed at helping bootstrapped founders access capital, understand finance, and navigate options like selling businesses, secondaries, or debt financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. The name "Tenzing" is inspired by Tenzing Norgay, Edmund Hillary's Sherpa, symbolizing guidance for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. This venture addresses a gap in the market where traditional investment bankers often specialize in larger deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

### Hyper-Targeted Advertising Service

An [[innovative_ideas_in_diverse_industries | innovative idea]] for a service that allows a user to "get on one person's radar" by hyper-targeting advertisements to a specific individual across their online activities (e.g., email newsletters, podcasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This "advertising sniper rifle" could be worth a significant amount to a client aiming to influence a key decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

## Investing and Business Philosophy

*   **Learning to Invest:** After selling Pixel Union, Wilkinson had a pile of cash and realized he needed to learn how to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This led him to obsessively read about value investing, transforming him from a novice to a top investor in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
*   **Operational Lens:** A key insight is that being a businessman makes one a better investor, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Operators can identify practical challenges that "spreadsheet investors" might overlook, such as the difficulty of implementing margin increases due to human factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **The "Verb" Principle:** Brands that become verbs (e.g., Google it, Uber there) tend to be the "de facto winners" of their categories, indicating a strong market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   **Holding Businesses:** Wilkinson generally prefers to buy and hold businesses indefinitely, rather than selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. He believes it's hard to predict how quickly a business might decline, and selling a dying business often yields little profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **Critique of Venture Capital:** Wilkinson criticizes the venture capital model for its misalignment of incentives and the "rigged game" it often entails, where firms collect large management fees regardless of investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. He notes that it can take 10-15 years to assess a fund's performance, by which time significant fees have already been earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of independent conviction rather than relying on "smart money" signals, as even highly intelligent investors make "colossal mistakes" or have unfair advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. This is particularly relevant in the context of [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | crypto investments]] where major funds made significant bets on flawed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

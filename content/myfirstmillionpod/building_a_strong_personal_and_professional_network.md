Developing a robust network is crucial for success, both personally and professionally. This involves strategic outreach, fostering genuine connections, and creating environments that facilitate interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

## Strategies for Network Building

### Becoming a "Collector of People"

A core philosophy for [[networking_and_meeting_influential_people | networking and meeting influential people]] is to be a "collector of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This means actively seeking out individuals who are interesting and making a mental note of who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. The aim is to eventually find ways to collaborate or mutually support each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

When reaching out to potential connections, consider this approach:
> "Hey look, the best case scenario here is that somehow we work together and we create Magic. The worst case scenario is that you have a new friend in the industry and we'll just help one another, but our world is small and I have a feeling that it's going to be nice that we're going to be on the same team in some capacity whether just as friends or literally at the same company so take this phone call." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>

This open and collaborative mindset sets the stage for [[building_authentic_relationships | authentic relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

### Creating Excuses to Meet People

Actively creating opportunities to connect with people is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. This can involve hosting events or establishing groups that draw interesting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>:

*   **Book Clubs (e.g., The Anti-MBA):** The speaker started a book club called "The Anti-MBA" in San Francisco in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Participants would read a quarter of a book monthly and then meet to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Experts on the book's topic were invited to lead conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This method, which was free and organized by the speaker, helped develop a significant network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
*   **Conferences (e.g., Hustle Con):** Hosting a conference like "Hustle Con" was a deliberate strategy to meet people who could inspire or partner in future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Meetups:** Organizing and participating in meetups is another effective way to connect with a [[networking_and_learning_from_diverse_industries | diverse group of people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

By being the "connector" and center of a social circle, one can effectively collect people into their network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

### Digital Outreach

Even with an established network, maintaining and expanding it through digital means is important. Directly messaging people on platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter to compliment their work or a specific post can leave a positive impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This makes future interactions easier as they already have some familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

## Building a Great Community

For companies like Hampton, which focuses on CEOs, [[building_a_personal_brand_for_business_growth | building a strong community]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Key elements for a successful community include:

*   **Creating FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** A certain level of exclusivity, such as an interview process and turning down most applicants, can make members feel excited and privileged to be part of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. A barrier to entry helps build a good community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Fostering Intimacy:**
    *   **Sub-Communities:** Divide the larger community into smaller, more intimate groups (e.g., allowing access to specific channels only) to prevent it from becoming "wonky" when it grows beyond 250-500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
    *   **Setting Norms and Standards:** Establish unique community norms, such as allowing members to "brag" about their achievements and business metrics, which can be invaluable for learning and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. Encourage frequent self-introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Seeding with Impressive Individuals:** Initially populate the community with influential or impressive individuals who can contribute high-quality content and activity, even if it means writing posts for them initially to create an appearance of vibrancy (a tactic observed from Reddit's early days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

Building a community is challenging, often more of an art than a science, but it's something many desire but few know how to achieve effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

Decentralized social networks represent a shift in the internet's structure, moving beyond traditional, centralized platforms to offer users greater control and economic participation [01:34:01]. These networks operate on principles of open state and open execution, contrasting sharply with the "one-sided" relationships found on platforms like Twitter or Facebook [01:35:38].

## Limitations of Traditional Social Networks

Historically, traditional social networks have captured all revenue, leaving content creators with no direct monetization [01:13:12]. Social networks were invented and scaled before cryptocurrency, meaning they could only transfer status, not value [00:59:59]. This led to platforms where everything boiled down to "status games" â€“ how many followers, faves, or likes one could accumulate [01:10:07]. While these status games might appear non-zero sum locally, they are globally zero-sum leaderboards where "only one can be at the top" [01:10:14].

A key issue with platforms like Twitter or Facebook is their "one-sided" API relationship, where they can throttle or destroy business models built on their platforms overnight [01:35:56]. This is because these companies maintain complete control over their source code and crucial database state [01:36:51].

## The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks

The advent of cryptocurrency enables a new model: **open state and open execution** [01:35:38]. This means that not only is the source code open (like in traditional open source), but the underlying database and execution are also transparent and verifiable [01:35:40].

### Benefits and Features

*   **Value Transfer:** Unlike traditional platforms that only allow status transfer, decentralized social networks enable the transfer of value, allowing users to earn cryptocurrency directly from their online activities [01:10:03].
*   **Creator Monetization:** These networks aim to provide "material benefit to people" by allowing users to earn from the content they produce, addressing the "zero creator monetization" issue on major platforms [01:13:09].
*   **Crypto Credentials:** Beyond just earning cryptocurrency, users can gain [[The evolution of digital identity and social medias impact on society | crypto credentials]] or "badges" in their digital wallet [01:14:11]. These badges reflect specific skills or accomplishments, providing a granular and verifiable alternative to traditional qualifications like college diplomas [01:14:37]. For example, completing five Python problems could earn a badge, or answering ten Russian history questions could earn another [01:14:21]. This system could allow individuals to log into job boards and be automatically qualified based on their verifiable credentials [01:16:16].
*   **Portable Data and Open Access:** The "open state" nature means that user data is not siloed within a single company's database [01:40:02]. This allows for a "portable crypto diploma" and makes data sets more open for analysis [01:16:13].
*   **Alignment of Incentives:** Decentralized social networks offer a model of "quantifiable alignment" where leaders (or founders of networks) gain or lose in direct relation to the average participant [01:32:04]. This contrasts with traditional leaders who may lack "skin in the game" [01:29:51].

### Key Concepts

*   **Truth, Health, and Wealth:** One project, 1729.com, promotes a tripartite motto of "truth, health, and wealth" as a guiding principle [01:11:04].
    *   **Truth:** Determined by learning and critical thinking [01:11:06].
    *   **Health:** Prioritized as fundamental, as "without that you have really nothing else" [01:11:08].
    *   **Wealth:** Considered important but takes a third priority, emphasizing that one should not sacrifice truth or long-term health for money [01:11:11].
*   **Entropic Internet vs. Deliberate Learning:** The current internet often leads to a "fragmented brain" due to the constant influx of novel but unsystematic information [01:19:07]. Decentralized platforms aim for a "less entropic internet" where content is served to "strengthen" users through deliberate learning and spaced repetition [01:20:00].
*   **Oracles and Advocates:** The future of media on these networks involves "oracles" (sensors or automated systems) that broadcast cryptographically verifiable data on-chain, and "advocates" (humans) who build narratives by citing these raw facts [01:48:03]. This system allows for visible editorial judgment and highlights what facts were selected or omitted [01:49:38].
*   **Math > Science:** The idea that mathematical, independently replicable proofs (like those on a blockchain) are more robust than peer-reviewed scientific assertions, which can be subject to institutional capture and "noble lies" [02:11:13]. The concept of "independent confirmations" on a blockchain is analogous to independent replications in science, providing verifiable truth [02:17:39].

## Current Examples and Future Vision

One project attempting to realize these concepts is 1729.com, described as a newsletter that pays users in Bitcoin for completing "micro tests" or tasks, allowing them to earn, learn, and build credentials [00:07:45]. This platform aims to build a community of "technological progressives" interested in a positive future, including [[Social media growth strategies | influencers]], writers, and activists [01:27:28].

The ultimate vision for decentralized social networks is a world where online time is productive, users earn value, and their skills are transparently verifiable through [[The evolution of digital identity and social medias impact on society | crypto credentials]] [01:14:06]. It's a move towards an internet where users are not just consumers but active participants who own their data and benefit directly from their contributions [01:44:03].

The broader trend sees a progression from tech companies (2000s) to crypto protocols (2010s), then to [[Cloud Communities and Digital Nomadism | startup cities]] (2020s), and finally to network states (2030s) [01:54:20]. This vision suggests a future where decentralized digital communities can materialize into physical spaces and even govern themselves with their own currencies and rules [01:23:59].

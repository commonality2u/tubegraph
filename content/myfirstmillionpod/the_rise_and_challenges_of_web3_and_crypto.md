Internet pioneer Kevin Rose, an "internet OG" known for founding Digg and being an early investor in Twitter, has significantly ventured into the world of Web3 and NFTs, considering it the "most fun" and a "blue ocean" for building new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Kevin Rose's Involvement in Web3

Kevin Rose recently launched an [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | NFT project]] called Proof, which has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. He describes the [[future_of_music_and_culture_in_the_crypto_age | cryptocurrency]] and [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | NFT]] space as the most enjoyable area he's worked in due to its "blue ocean" nature and the vast potential for new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

He emphasizes that his projects are driven by personal passion and the desire to build things that don't yet exist, rather than solely focusing on financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

## NFT Use Cases and Potential

Rose champions NFTs as a transformative technology, akin to a new vertical for art. He highlights their ability to provide:
*   **Proven provenance and scarcity:** Unlike physical collectibles such as comic books or luxury watches (like Rolexes, which produce over a million units per year and manipulate scarcity perceptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>, NFTs offer verifiable ownership and limited supply on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.
*   **Dynamic and interactive art:** NFTs can incorporate animation, react to real-time data like stock market prices or moon phases, offering unique creative possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
*   **Combating fraud in luxury goods:** For high-end items like wine, NFTs can serve as digital certificates, proving authenticity, tracking storage conditions, and facilitating seamless, fraud-free transfers of ownership without physical possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   **Enhanced gaming experiences:** NFTs can enable true ownership of in-game items, allowing players to resell them or even transfer them between different games, increasing their value and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.
*   **Loyalty and reward programs:** NFTs can replace traditional points systems, offering transparent and permanent loyalty rewards that exist on the blockchain, independent of a company's longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. For example, an artist could reward fans who have attended multiple shows with a VIP meet and greet, with attendance verified via NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

While some NFT use cases, such as taking a loan against a concert ticket, might seem "silly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, Rose asserts that the underlying technology offers significant advantages in various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. He predicts that in the future, 90% of people interacting with NFTs won't even realize they're using blockchain technology; it will simply be a seamless part of their digital experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms of Web3

Kevin Rose acknowledges several [[challenges_and_potential_of_ai_technology | challenges]] and common criticisms of the Web3 movement:

*   **Maximalism:** He criticizes "maximalists" who believe only one approach or [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | cryptocurrency]] (like Bitcoin) is valid, calling this a "danger of web 3" that can lead to "Crazy Town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of clear problem-solving:** Critics argue that many Web3 projects are "a bunch of people making products to serve an industry that has yet to truly figure out what the thing is that they're doing," often without solving real problems better than existing Web 2.0 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
*   **Dogmatic decentralization:** The idea that "everything has to be decentralized" is too dogmatic; some services, like customer support, benefit from centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. Rose supports a hybrid approach, where centralized companies like Coinbase can manage decentralized currencies and services like staking, offering customer support alongside decentralized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **"Circular economy" criticism:** There's a perception that Web3 is a self-serving "circle jerk" where people are "making shit up in order to like get in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin as an inflation hedge:** The promise of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge has been questioned, especially when its price dropped significantly during periods of high inflation, leading to doubts about its "time to shine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. Rose admits Bitcoin's "spiky nature" hurts its perception but maintains its long-term growth is still impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>. He also notes concerns about Bitcoin's environmental impact, as it is "not a green currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Rose believes that the fundamental advantages of blockchain, such as being a "distributed immutable database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>, will unlock many valuable use cases, even if they aren't explicitly labeled as "NFTs" or "Web3" to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in the Crypto Age

Rose views [[insights_into_cryptocurrency_trading_and_investment | crypto]] as an important asset class for diversification, typically allocating around 10% of his liquid portfolio to it, split between NFTs and other digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. His core investment strategy remains "super vanilla," with about 80% in low-cost Vanguard index funds for diversification, while acknowledging his significant high-risk exposure through his role as a venture capital partner at True Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

Cody Sanchez advocates for investing in "boring businesses" like laundromats, believing they offer accessible opportunities for many people to gain business ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>. Her philosophy is that almost anyone could own a business, and that having "skin in the game" would benefit society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:08">[05:40:08]</a>.

## Why Laundromats? "Gateway Drug Businesses"

Sanchez refers to laundromats as "gateway drug businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:04">[05:16:04]</a>. She argues that if someone cannot understand the simple business model of putting a coin into a machine to get clean clothes, they probably shouldn't run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:29">[05:29:29]</a>.

### Business Model and Operations
Laundromats are considered a very simplistic business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:31">[05:30:31]</a>. They generally involve setting up machines where customers pay to wash and dry clothes.

*   **Setup Speed**: Unlike normal retail stores that can take months or even a year to set up, a Halloween Express (which follows a similar pop-up model) can be built out in a matter of days or weeks, costing between $10,000 and $50,000 to "throw up" a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:02">[02:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. While not explicitly stated for laundromats, the ease of setup implied for simple businesses is a key factor.
*   **Challenges**: The hardest parts of running a laundromat are operational issues like machine breakdowns, dealing with disruptive individuals, or property damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:01">[05:50:01]</a>. These are challenges any human could handle, rather than complex financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:11">[05:53:11]</a>.
*   **Profit Drivers**:
    *   The primary driver of revenue and higher-level customers comes from the "wash and fold" business, where staff pick up, wash, and deliver laundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:04">[05:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:22">[05:25:22]</a>. This contrasts with the simpler walk-in self-service laundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:16">[05:26:16]</a>.
    *   [[selffunded_companies_and_cash_flow_management | Cash flow management]] is a key consideration, as businesses can run out of cash if financials are misrepresented or poorly tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

### Profitability and Investment Returns
Laundromats are typically not businesses for billionaires, but rather for individuals looking for a solid return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:20">[05:22:20]</a>.

*   **Revenue**: The average laundromat generates between $100,000 and $500,000 in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:41">[05:36:41]</a>. Sanchez has seen one large laundromat doing $3 million a year, which is revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:06">[05:48:06]</a>.
*   **Margins**: Laundromats typically operate at 10% to 15% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:02">[05:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:58">[05:13:58]</a>. The $3 million revenue laundromat also had 15% margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:02">[05:12:02]</a>.
*   **Owner's Profit**: An owner can expect to make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year from a single laundromat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:20">[05:18:20]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: To make a good living, an owner needs to acquire multiple laundromats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:26">[05:27:26]</a>. Sanchez suggests starting with one and, if successful, expanding to three to five locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:26">[05:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:08">[05:58:08]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Rentals**: A laundromat purchased for around $100,000 could generate $30,000 to $50,000 annually, whereas a short-term rental costing $250,000 might only net $120 to $160 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:52">[05:50:52]</a>. This suggests a better risk-reward trade-off for laundromats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a>.

### Cody Sanchez's Experience
Sanchez's first "boring business" acquisition was a laundromat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. She bought them while still working in corporate finance, initially concerned it might be a conflict of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

*   **Motivation**: She bought these businesses to generate enough income to leave her corporate job, which involved working 70 hours a week and frequent international travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:20">[05:19:20]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Strategy**: Sanchez leveraged an existing operator who knew how to run laundromats and had found a cheap acquisition target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:08">[05:53:08]</a>. She was willing to risk $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:04">[05:59:04]</a>.
*   **Portfolio**: Over her career, she has owned around 25 to 30 laundromats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Exiting Investments**: Sanchez has successfully sold many of her laundromats at "great multiples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. She emphasizes that the goal for these types of small businesses is steady cash flow, not necessarily a "crazy exit" unless they are scaled significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This approach highlights a [[reinvestment_strategy_in_business_growth | reinvestment strategy in business growth]] focused on continuous cash flow and portfolio expansion.

### Addressing the "Stupid" Question
When asked if investing in laundromats means everyone else running complex businesses is "stupid," Sanchez clarifies that it depends on the individual's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:40">[05:43:40]</a>. Laundromats are not for billionaires, but they are accessible and provide ownership for those new to business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:20">[05:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:28">[05:24:28]</a>.

For someone like a teacher with six months off, owning a laundromat could be a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:15">[05:58:15]</a>. It's about starting with something simple in their local community, building confidence, and potentially moving on to larger endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.

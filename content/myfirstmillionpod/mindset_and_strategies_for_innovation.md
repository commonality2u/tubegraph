Jess Ma is an entrepreneur recognized by those who respect her as one of the best entrepreneurs in the world, despite not being widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Paul Graham of Y Combinator placed her on a very short list of the most impressive people he thought would achieve the most in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. She has built herself to oversee 10 companies combined worth $950 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ma's journey exemplifies an [[entrepreneurial_mindset_and_societal_shifts | entrepreneurial mindset]] that embraces bold bets and unconventional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Early Entrepreneurial Journey
Jess Ma's early life was marked by challenges in traditional schooling. She was a "total geek loser" who felt like an outsider, even in the computer club, and was bullied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. She struggled with grades due to disinterest and a lack of friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. At 13, she started a dedicated server and collocation business, believing it to be normal, to offset her gaming server expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. This business eventually generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. She dropped out of high school halfway through her sophomore year and got into a college program early, which she credits with saving her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

Her first major company, Indera, was a financial SaaS company providing accounting, tax, and bill management software and services to businesses like Slack, Pinterest, DoorDash, Instacart, and Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Ma built Indera without traditional venture funding, relying on angel investors to retain most of the ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The business became cash-flowing and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## The Shift in Mindset: From CEO to Visionary
Ma initially grew up with the mindset that success meant being a CEO and making a company a unicorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, after a difficult personal experience where her boyfriend unexpectedly died, she entered a period of deep depression and realized that running a company was no longer on her list of things she would do if she had limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This led her to hire a CEO for Indera and delegate other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear and Insecurity
Ma deliberately embraced a philosophy of not being scared of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. After hitting "rock bottom," she felt her life couldn't get any worse, which freed her to try new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. She acknowledges the insecurity of feeling like a beginner in new fields, comparing it to learning a new skill set after being proficient as an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Her approach is to learn, have a great time, and trust that the outcome will work itself out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

For instance, despite getting a C-minus in biology in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, she ventured into biotech. She hired a biology tutor, digested information, and brought in experts who had run biotech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This demonstrates a willingness to learn and leverage the intelligence of others rather than relying solely on personal expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

### The "What If" Question
A pivotal question for Ma, as well as for the interviewer, was "What would I do if I wasn't afraid of failing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This question allowed them to challenge conventional Silicon Valley rhetoric that emphasizes being a CEO and building a unicorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Ma realized that many billionaires were diversified holding company owners who retained ownership for decades and weren't always the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This insight led her to shift her focus to a more diversified, investment-manager-like role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

She also asks "What would you do if you were a billionaire and not allowed to do what you're doing today?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This question highlights true passions beyond financial necessity.

## Strategies for [[innovative_business_strategies_and_resilience | Innovation and Growth]]

### Bold Science and Non-Incremental Approaches
Ma's current focus is on "bold science," which involves non-incremental, significant leaps in function or quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. She contrasts this with companies working on minor improvements, such as extending lifespan by a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. An example is her work on a company focused on "rehabilitating" cancer cells rather than just killing them, based on the idea that cancer cells might be trying to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

She leads a biotech venture creation holding company centered around scientist Mike Levin, whose research suggests that bioelectricity, not just genetics, dictates biological outcomes like lifespan and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. This includes companies developing solutions for drug resistance and programmable human biobots called anthrobots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. She also explores [[innovative_ideas_in_diverse_industries | innovative ideas in diverse industries]], such as growing a baby from raw genetic material in a fish tank, although she notes this is a long-term prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

### The "Manifestation Studio" Approach
Instead of a traditional holding company, Ma refers to her structure as a "manifestation studio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. It's an extension of herself, with a team of brilliant people who help her manifest ideas into reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This involves identifying a vision, securing capital, and finding operators to put the pieces together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. She believes that these things don't have to wait until one has a billion dollars in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This aligns with [[the_law_of_attraction_and_mindset_strategies | mindset strategies]] and the idea of resourcefulness being the master skill to acquire any needed resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

### The Importance of "Getting on the Plane"
Ma emphasizes the practice of "getting on the plane" â€” proactively meeting people in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. She believes in physically traveling to meet someone, even for a single meeting, to make a strong impression and build relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. She contrasts an in-person meeting as a "10 out of 10" for engagement, while a Zoom call might be a "two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. She practiced this even as a 16-year-old, cold-emailing notable figures like Justin Khan and Mark Benioff and offering to fly to them just to observe their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

### Learning from Diverse Fields
A key trait of highly successful individuals is their fascination with many topics and willingness to learn about random things that have nothing to do with their day-to-day business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. Ma, like Paul Graham, believes this broad knowledge helps in synthesizing ideas from multiple fields, leading to better outcomes than domain experts might achieve alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. For example, the interviewer started a company after attending a farming conference, blending ideas from the tech world with agricultural insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.

## Billionaire Secrets: Financial and Personal Strategies

### Tax Optimization
Ma stresses that "top tax optimization" is a significant factor in wealth compounding, as taxes can impact half of one's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. She learned from billionaires to employ the best tax strategists, often consulting multiple experts to combine advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. She argues that people should dedicate at least 5-10% of their time to tax strategy, as it offers the highest return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

### Strategic Asset Purchases
Billionaires often approach expensive purchases differently. For instance, buying a $30 million yacht or a private plane can result in tax write-offs equivalent to or exceeding the down payment, and operational costs can be offset by chartering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. This allows for net positive cash flow from assets like yachts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Similarly, certain luxury cars can be driven for years and then resold at or above their purchase price due to exclusivity and waiting lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. This illustrates a "rich get richer" dynamic where wealth is used to acquire assets that provide benefits, tax savings, and retain value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### Personal Optimization (Coaching, Health)
Ma invests in herself through two monthly coaches, viewing it as essential maintenance for her mindset, similar to going to the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. She also participates in a CEO group, which she likens to "Alcoholics Anonymous for CEOs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

For physical and mental acuity, she works with five concierge doctors to develop a custom plan for nutrition, nootropics, and IVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This includes custom-compounded supplements and quarterly exosome IVs, which are believed to lower biological age, increase energy, and promote autophagy (body's ability to get rid of old cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. She believes optimizing mental function and energy by 25% is worth the $15,000-$25,000 annual cost, calling it an "80/20 rule" approach compared to more expensive programs like Brian Johnson's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

Ma's approach to [[innovative_product_development_and_launch_strategies | innovation]] and [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | venture creation]] emphasizes boldness, learning, and strategic networking. She encourages an [[investment_strategies and decisionmaking in startups | investment strategies and decision-making in startups]] and sees that the underlying motivation for her ventures is not just profit, but a desire to advance research and change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. She views money as a means to build great products and pursue exciting, mission-oriented goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>. Her philosophy boils down to a fundamental belief that it's "dangerous to wait" on pursuing one's true desires, as life tends to fill up with other responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

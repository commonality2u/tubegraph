Mark Jenny is an entrepreneur known for building a successful luxury Airbnb portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. He is described as an "amazing amazing amazing entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a> and a great friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Background
Jenny's journey began from challenging circumstances; he was raised in a non-privileged home, potentially without a father or in a single-parent household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. At one point, he was even homeless, living out of a storage unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

He started various companies, including "info marketing" businesses that saw moderate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. A significant venture was RVshare, an "Airbnb for RVs," a large portion of which he eventually sold to KKR, a private equity company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This sale reportedly earned him "many many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## The Luxury Airbnb Portfolio
For the past five or so years, Jenny has been building a "huge portfolio of Airbnbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, owning around 20 properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. These are high-end luxury homes designed to sleep about 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Each property typically features a two-acre plot with a large home (four, five, or six thousand square feet) and amenities like basketball courts, tennis courts, and mini putt-putt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

He has developed this into a "really really good business" generating millions of dollars from renting these Airbnbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. It operates as a "proper company" with a small team, not merely a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The portfolio is estimated to be valued at around $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, a figure Jenny shares on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

He actively shares his progress and transformations on Twitter, posting "before and after" photos of the properties, showcasing additions like a "McDonald's play place in the backyard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Despite his success, he is not a widely popular public figure, with only a few thousand followers on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Connection to Early Hustles
> Jenny's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from a young age. One of his very first hustles involved selling custom dollar bills for $15 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. At just 15 years old, he discovered that dollar bills featuring Michael Jordan's face (achieved by placing a sticker over George Washington's image) were selling on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. He replicated this by buying dollar bills and adding sticker paper from Office Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

> He started selling these on eBay, tracking competitors' sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Initially, he averaged 100 sales per day, yielding a profit of about $1,500 daily (including shipping costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. He scaled this to $10,000 in daily sales, becoming the largest seller of custom novelty collectible dollar bills on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. He used growth hacks like direct messaging losing bidders from auctions with a custom offer at their highest bid price to secure more sales and improve his seller ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This early venture demonstrates his ability to identify and capitalize on [[building_and_selling_successful_businesses|arbitrage opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

[[rich_peoples_approaches_to_health_and_longevity | Rich people's approaches to health and longevity]] often involve advanced and sometimes unconventional methods to extend lifespan and improve health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This interest spans from historical figures like John Rockefeller and Thomas Edison to modern billionaires who invest heavily in [[biotechnology_ventures_and_bold_science | biotechnology ventures]] and personal health regimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Metformin: A Diabetes Drug for Longevity?

One prominent example of a drug gaining attention for its potential longevity benefits is Metformin.
[[sam_altmans_investments_in_antiaging_and_energy_companies | Sam Altman]], CEO of OpenAI, has invested his liquid net worth into two companies, one of which is Retro, a health company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Altman states he is "obsessed with anti-aging" and takes Metformin as part of his routine, alongside eating healthy, exercising, and sleeping enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He also hopes to one day take Retro Health's medicines when they become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has also shown interest in Metformin and Rapamycin as longevity drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Metformin was FDA-approved in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Its primary function is to help with insulin sensitivity, which regulates blood sugar spikes, particularly important for diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The interest in Metformin for longevity stems from a correlation observed between stable blood sugar levels and extended lifespan; significant blood sugar spikes are linked to living less long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These types of drugs, referred to as GLPs (glucose-limiting drugs), are found to help manage glucose spiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Initially given to diabetics, it was noted that many of these patients lived longer, leading to the hypothesis that the drug itself might contribute to longevity by maintaining low blood sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It is reportedly common among wealthy individuals and biohackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Other Longevity Approaches Among the Wealthy

Beyond Metformin, other approaches and drugs are explored by those seeking to extend their lives:

*   **[[the_economic_and_social_implications_of_glp1_drugs | Semaglutide]] (Ozempic)**: Similar to Metformin in being a diabetic drug now used by the general public, it rapidly gained popularity for weight loss and is currently facing global shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Rapamycin**: Another drug mentioned alongside Metformin by Vitalik Buterin for its potential in longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and Parabiosis**: Peter Thiel, known for his strong views against death (viewing it as a "psychological defense mechanism"), reportedly takes HGH and engages in parabiosis, a process involving injecting younger people's blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Holistic [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle | healthy lifestyle]]s**: Historically, figures like John Rockefeller were meticulous about their diet, chewing food slowly and becoming vegetarian in old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Thomas Edison also practiced a light diet and daily naps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### The Pursuit of [[the_concept_of_biological_versus_chronological_age_and_blueprint | Biological Age]] Reduction

[[the_concept_of_biological_versus_chronological_age_and_blueprint | Bryan Johnson]], founder of Braintree (which owns Venmo), is a notable figure in the longevity space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. He spends millions annually on his "[[the_concept_of_biological_versus_chronological_age_and_blueprint | Blueprint]]" regimen, which involves a strict plant-based diet, specific exercise routines, and rigorous measurement of biological markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

A growing interest exists in measuring "[[the_concept_of_biological_versus_chronological_age_and_blueprint | biological age]]" versus "chronological age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This concept, previously unknown to many, is gaining traction, with individuals eager to discover and potentially reduce their biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This has led to the emergence of:

*   **Rejuvenation Olympics**: A competition where thousands of people upload their results to see who can most effectively decrease their biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The tagline is "You win by never crossing the finish line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. [[the_concept_of_biological_versus_chronological_age_and_blueprint | Bryan Johnson]] is currently ranked number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Testing Services**: There is potential for [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business opportunities in longevity and healthcare]] in creating low-cost testing services, similar to Everlywell or DEXA scan clinics, to provide individuals with their biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Once a number is provided, there is a strong potential to upsell thousands of dollars in nutrition, training, or medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **Inside Tracker**: A current service that offers biological age measurement through blood tests at Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp. It costs around $600-$700 and results are available in about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. One user reported a nine-year difference between their chronological and biological age (33 vs. 22-23) through this service, making it a competition to reduce it further every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The trend suggests that what "billionaires are doing" in health and longevity will eventually become popular among a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Craig Clemens, a marketer who has built a billion-dollar company without outside investors, offers a masterclass on the "Seven Human Hijacks" â€“ tactics he has used to sell over a billion dollars of products online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These "human hijacks" manipulate the limbic system of the brain, making people pay attention and respond to marketing messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Historical Context: Edward Bernays and the Birth of Consumerism

Edward Bernays, often called the father of public relations and nephew of Sigmund Freud, fundamentally changed daily behavior and is credited with creating modern consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Before Bernays, people primarily bought clothes for work; he helped shift this perspective to clothing as a form of expression, leading to increased purchases and the concept of seasonal trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## The Seven Human Hijacks

Craig Clemens identifies seven ways marketers can influence consumer behavior:
1.  **Make it about them**: Focus on the customer and the benefits they will receive, rather than just the product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
2.  **Make it an event**: Create a spectacle or occasion that naturally draws attention and media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
3.  **Powerful demonstration**: Show, don't just tell, the product's effectiveness in a memorable and often dramatic way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
4.  **Unquestionable proof**: Provide evidence, especially from experts or prominent figures, that validates the product's claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
5.  **Change a daily behavior**: Integrate the product into existing or new daily habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
6.  **Sell the dream**: Market the aspirational outcome or transformation the customer will experience <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
7.  **Help them rebel or feel superior**: Appeal to people's desire to defy the status quo or distinguish themselves from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Case Studies in Marketing Hijacks

### Pepsodent Toothpaste: Creating a Daily Habit
In the 1920s, only 5% of people brushed their teeth daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Marketer Claude Hopkins, hired by Pepsodent, created a campaign that transformed oral hygiene into a mainstream habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Powerful Demonstration**: The ad asked people to run their tongue over their teeth to feel the "film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Sell the Dream**: It promised that brushing with Pepsodent would remove the film and reveal a "movie star smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Make it about them**: The messaging directly addressed the potential user's desire for a better smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
Within a decade, 85% of Americans brushed their teeth daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Competitors struggled to replicate Pepsodent's success until they discovered customers loved the minty tingle, a subtle sensory cue that signaled the toothpaste was working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Otis Elevators: Demonstrating Safety
In 1854, people feared elevators due to safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Elisha Otis, who invented a safety braking system, initially struggled with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. PT Barnum, the legendary showman, orchestrated a dramatic public demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Make it an event**: At the Crystal Palace in New York City, Otis stood on an elevator while his assistant cut the ropes with an axe. The elevator dropped slightly, then the braking system engaged, prompting Otis to declare, "All safe here, gentlemen!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Powerful Demonstration & Unquestionable Proof**: Otis risked his own life, providing undeniable evidence of the system's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Make it about them**: The demonstration directly addressed the public's fear of elevator accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
This led to a surge in sales, securing Otis's legacy in iconic structures like the Eiffel Tower and Empire State Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### Mini Katana: Visual Proof for Unique Products
Selling products like swords online faces challenges due to advertising restrictions on platforms like Google and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Mini Katana circumvented this by hiring YouTubers and TikTokers to create compelling visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Powerful Demonstration**: Instead of listing features, videos showed the swords cutting through a bullet in slow motion or slicing a steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
This strategy is akin to Bill Gates drinking purified dirty water in a TED Talk or knife infomercials showing blades cutting through pennies, creating an unforgettable impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Dr. Oz: Dramatizing Health Benefits
Dr. Oz effectively leveraged his TV show to promote supplements without endorsing specific brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Make it an event**: His show itself served as a platform for dramatic, visual demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
*   **Powerful Demonstration**: He would use balloons to represent fat cells and then "pop" them with a pin, symbolizing the effect of supplements like Garcinia Cambogia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof**: His status as a doctor lent credibility to his claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Make it about them**: He pitched these as "miracle weight loss cures for all body types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
This approach, while sometimes leading to unethical practices, generated billions in sales for the promoted ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Power Balance Bracelets: Exploiting Demonstrations
The Power Balance bracelet, despite being later exposed as unethical, used a highly effective, albeit misleading, demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. People would experience seemingly increased balance or strength while wearing the bracelet, which was often due to subtle changes in pressure or angle during the demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Lucky Strike Cigarettes: Torches of Freedom
In the 1930s, when public smoking by women was illegal and considered unladylike, Lucky Strike sought to expand its market beyond men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Edward Bernays capitalized on the ongoing women's rights movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Make it an event**: During the highly publicized Easter Parade in New York City, Bernays arranged for socialites to openly smoke cigarettes on a float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Help them Rebel/Feel Superior**: When reporters reacted, Bernays's crew framed the act as women "declaring their rights with these 'torches of Freedom'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. This positioned smoking as an act of rebellion and empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof**: The involvement of prominent women made the act appear acceptable and even fashionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
This campaign successfully turned smoking into a "movement" for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Bernays further manipulated perception by creating a "Gala Green Ball" to popularize green, Lucky Strike's package color, making it the most fashionable color within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### The Great American Breakfast: Selling Bacon
In the early 20th century, breakfast was typically light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. Beach-Nut Bacon sought to sell more product, and Bernays identified an untapped mealtime opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof**: Bernays orchestrated a survey where 4,500 doctors endorsed the idea that a hearty breakfast with bacon was the best way to start the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Make it about them & Sell the Dream**: Newspapers published headlines like "Doctors agree a hearty breakfast containing bacon is the best way to store energy to last throughout your workday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.
*   **Help them Feel Superior**: This also created a subtle sense of superiority for those eating a hearty breakfast over those having just a roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
This campaign established bacon as a staple of American breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### Sunkist Orange Juice: A Daily Dose of Vitamins
In the 1910s, California orange growers faced overproduction and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. Albert Lasker, a marketing executive, unified the growers under the "Sunkist" brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Change Daily Behavior**: Observing that growers would squeeze oranges for their children as a treat, Lasker promoted orange juice as a daily habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.
*   **Sell the Dream**: He launched a campaign touting oranges' vitamins and nutrients, tying orange juice to meals for better health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof**: Ads cited "doctors recommend" for nutrient intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.
*   **Make it about them**: The campaign emphasized the health benefits for the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
A promotion offering a free juicer with proof of orange purchase helped solidify the new behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

### Modern Examples of Changing Daily Behavior
*   **Bulletproof Coffee**: Intercepted an existing habit (drinking coffee) by adding a new component (butter/MCT oil) to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **The Miracle Morning**: A book that encourages daily journaling, creating a new behavior that people frequently discuss, leading to continuous word-of-mouth promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

### Nike: The Power of Rebellion
In the 1970s, running was not a popular activity, and traditional shoes were the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof**: Nike leveraged Steve Prefontaine, a dominant college runner and media figure, to wear their shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. His celebrity endorsement provided powerful validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
*   **Help them Rebel/Feel Superior**: Wearing athletic shoes became a statement against traditional, "dad" shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. This "rebellion" transformed athletic shoes into a best-selling category for daily attire, far beyond athletic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Sell the Dream**: Later, campaigns with Michael Jordan reinforced the dream of athletic prowess and superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

### Marketing through Rebellion Against the Status Quo
*   **Vibram Five Fingers / "Nees Over Toes Guy"**: Modern examples of rebellion against traditional fitness norms and established brands like Nike, promoting "barefoot" style shoes and alternative training methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Apple "1984" ad**: A direct rebellion against the dominant IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.
*   **Volkswagen "Think Small" campaign**: Positioned the VW bug as a counter-cultural statement against large, ornate American cars of the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Political Campaigns (Donald Trump)**: Trump is described as a master marketer who rallies his base by promoting a sense of rebellion against "elites" or the "status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. His use of "verbal kill shots" and simple, repetitive phrases effectively brands opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### Public Service Announcements: "This is Your Brain on Drugs"
*   **Powerful Demonstration**: The iconic "This is your brain on drugs" ad, featuring an egg sizzling in a frying pan, created an unforgettable visual that immediately links drugs to irreversible damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. This visual demonstration sticks in the mind due to its relation to fundamental physics and how humans learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Golden Hippo and Probiotics: Creating a New Category
Craig Clemens' company, Golden Hippo, played a significant role in creating the mainstream probiotics category in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.
*   **Market Education**: Initially, few people knew about probiotics or the microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Golden Hippo's marketing focused on educating consumers about hidden sugars and artificial sweeteners in their food and how probiotics could counteract their negative effects on gut health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **Changing Daily Behavior**: The goal was to encourage daily probiotic consumption to aid digestion and overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
*   **Unquestionable Proof & Selling the Dream**: By highlighting scientific information and showing how probiotics could combat the effects of unhealthy food, they sold the dream of better digestive health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
A viral video explaining the issues with modern food and the benefits of probiotics garnered over 100 million views in four months, leading to Keybiotics becoming the biggest probiotic brand globally at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. Later, partnering with Dr. Gundry, whose educational presentations further popularized the microbiome and probiotics, led to massive spikes in product searches and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

### [[the_creation_and_evolution_of_consumer_categories | Product Market Stages]]
Craig Clemens describes three stages of a product market, each requiring different [[marketing_strategies_that_drive_consumer_behavior | marketing strategies that drive consumer behavior]]:
1.  **Clueless**: The market knows nothing about the product. Marketing must create the wave, starting with a problem the audience cares about and then introducing the product as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
2.  **Curious**: People have heard the product term. Marketing can directly engage with their curiosity, often by challenging existing perceptions or offering deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.
3.  **Saturation**: The market is commoditized, requiring strong, differentiated campaigns to break through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

By understanding and applying these "human hijacks" and adapting [[the_evolution_of_marketing_strategies | marketing strategies]] to the market stage, entrepreneurs and marketers can significantly influence [[sales_strategies_and_psychology | consumer behavior]] and drive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

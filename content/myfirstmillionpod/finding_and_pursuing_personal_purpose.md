The journey of finding and pursuing one's personal purpose involves self-reflection, understanding core motivations, and aligning actions with what truly brings fulfillment, rather than solely chasing conventional markers of success like wealth or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

## Distinguishing "Cool for You" from "Cool for Me"
A key step in this process is recognizing the difference between what might seem "cool" or desirable for others and what genuinely resonates with one's own desires and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. This distinction helps in avoiding external pressures and focusing on personal fulfillment.

## The "Second Mountain" Phase
For individuals who have achieved a degree of security or conventional success, a "second mountain" phase often emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. This phase involves seeking a new problem to work on or a different way to spend life that aligns with higher levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>.

## Identifying Your Innate Purpose
One approach to [[personal_development_and_growth | personal development and growth]] and finding purpose involves answering the question: "What's the one thing you can't not do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This exercise encourages identifying an inherent quality or action that comes naturally and is deeply ingrained in one's being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. The purpose is not something to be acquired, but rather something already inside that needs to be fully expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

For Jesse, this realization came through a [[importance_of_personal_transformation_and_healthy_lifestyle | personal growth journey]] and spiritual journey, where he identified his core purpose as helping others become the best versions of themselves and raise their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. This innate drive was something his friends and employees already recognized in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

## Aligning Work with Purpose
Aligning daily tasks and career choices with this innate purpose can transform the experience of work. For example, instead of managing a to-do list based on initiatives or client tasks, one can frame it around how to help the individuals they work with be their best selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. This reframing can lead to a more inspired and less scarcity-minded approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

Jesse's current venture, Gateway X, is a direct result of his desire to help others learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. He consciously chooses not to be the CEO of individual companies within the studio, avoiding operational tasks like staff meetings or managing compensation plans, which he no longer finds fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. Instead, his role is to foster the growth of businesses by focusing on the development of the individuals running them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. This approach ensures his work remains [[the_importance_of_focused_life_goals_and_seasons | continually energizing]] and sustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

## Financial Independence and Fulfillment
While financial success is often a goal, pursuing purpose can lead to a different kind of [[personal_development_and_financial_independence | financial independence]] and fulfillment. Reflecting on career choices, like leaving a high-paying job at Goldman Sachs, can highlight the preference for dynamic and personally engaging work over a traditional, structured path that might not align with one's long-term vision of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to find what one genuinely enjoys and commit fully to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>, as achieving significant success in any field often requires immense effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

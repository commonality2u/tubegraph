Patrick Campbell, the founder of ProfitWell, a company originally named Price Intelligently, built a subscription financial database that was eventually sold to Paddle, a payments infrastructure product, for over $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. ProfitWell was bootstrapped, meaning Campbell and his co-founder owned 100% of the company, though they were generous in giving out equity, resulting in 13 millionaires and 120 people receiving some consideration from the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:01:13]</a>.

## ProfitWell's Business Model and Data Scale
ProfitWell's core mission was to "run and grow subscription businesses automatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users could plug ProfitWell into any subscription business's billing system (like Stripe or Zuora) to automatically receive financial metrics for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:03:05]</a>. They then offered services to reduce churn, optimize pricing, and, with the Paddle acquisition, handle taxes and chargebacks automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:15]</a>.

The company discovered a niche when they found an IPO-bound company miscalculating its Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:33]</a>. They developed a free metrics product, which differentiated them in a crowded market where "everyone and their mother is building a Stripe integration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:54]</a>. This free offering helped them grow to 30,000 companies using ProfitWell by the time of its sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:18]</a>.

ProfitWell amassed a "largest subscription financial database in the world," processing between $120 and $130 billion in annual recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:26]</a>. This vast data allowed them to train algorithms for churn reduction and publish content on SaaS benchmarks like churn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:07:07]</a>. The data also provided insights that acted as "hidden deal flow" for venture capitalists, though specific company numbers were never revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Hidden Industry Insights from the Data
The database revealed several fascinating industries with significant growth, particularly valuable for those looking to move quickly into new markets before a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Quilting and Crafts
The [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | quilting and crafts]] space has seen "insane" growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:51]</a>. Quilting is a $4.5 billion per year industry, with the average quilter spending $8,000 to $9,000 annually on supplies, much of which comes through local quilt shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:08:11]</a>. Key aspects of this market include:
*   **Subscription Models**: Many companies leverage existing community traditions, like the "block of the month club," where participants create a quilt block monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Community and Social Aspects**: [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | Quilt retreats]] are popular, where people gather to work on quilts and socialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Digital Adoption**: While older quilters heavily use Facebook groups, there's an opportunity for growth on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:23]</a>. YouTube content, such as tutorials from the Missouri Star Quilt Company, has even revitalized towns by drawing visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Underlying Trends**: The hobby's resilience stems from combining DIY/crafts, therapeutic repetition, community, and nostalgia (e.g., making quilts from old clothes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Products for Older Audiences / "Baby Boomer Kid Guilt"
Another area of interest is services or products sold to the children of older people, often capitalizing on a sense of "baby boomer kid guilt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:06]</a>. An example is Nanograms, a one-man operation that converts emails or Instagram posts into physical postcards sent to grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:25]</a>. This trend aligns with the aging population, leading to increased multiples on businesses like old folks' homes and hospice care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:55]</a>.

### The Death Industry
The death industry (coffins, funeral service homes, memory services) is dominated by a few large, multi-billion-dollar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:39]</a>. Despite the entrenched players, the aging population suggests potential opportunities for innovation, particularly in technology plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:27:21]</a>.

## Strategic Insights from Data
### Customer Loyalty and Targeting
Data shows that older audiences tend to retain at a higher rate in consumer businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:38]</a>. They might be harder to convert initially due to loyalty, but once they commit, they stick around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:50]</a>. Generally, [[financial_and_lifestyle_insights_of_successful_entrepreneurs | more premium products]] or those targeting niche audiences also experience better churn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:18:02]</a>. Patrick recommends that [[selffunded_companies_and_cash_flow_management | bootstrapped companies]] start with a premium price point and then consider reducing it, as it's harder to raise prices later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:24]</a>.

Patrick advises against "selling a cool thing to a cool person," particularly for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs targeting millennials or Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:44]</a>. Instead, the strategy should be to "sell simple things to simple people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:55]</a>. This often means targeting demographics like "an overweight overworked mom in Texas" or "Bob the mid-level manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:47]</a>. These segments, though perhaps less "sexy" to urban tech circles, offer high loyalty and are often overlooked, allowing for significant scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Competitive Intelligence (NSA Learnings)
Patrick applied his experience as an intelligence analyst from the NSA to develop a competitive intelligence program at ProfitWell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:28:10]</a>. His approach focused on "first principles thinking" about a target and understanding changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:43]</a>.

The program involved:
*   **"Moles" (Qualitative Data)**: Gathering insights from former employees of competitors (especially those who left on bad terms), and friendly customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:17]</a>. These "moles" provided "color" to guide quantitative analysis and predict competitor actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Mass Data (Quantitative Surveys)**: Identifying competitor customers through public information (e.g., website snippets like "BuiltWith," case studies, logos, social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:31:02]</a>. Patrick would then send short (30-60 second, 3-5 question) surveys, often disguised as "software research," to gather Net Promoter Score (NPS) and feature preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:46]</a>. The goal was to build a timeline of trends, not just a single data point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Application**: This competitive data was deemed most valuable for marketing teams, leading to better customer retention and lower customer acquisition costs (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:30]</a>. For example, when ProfitWell learned competitors had accuracy issues with financial metrics, it became their core marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:57]</a>. Product teams, however, should avoid being solely driven by competitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **"Red Team Docs"**: Patrick maintained documents outlining potential threats or criticisms to the business, detailing steps to respond if they materialized. This helped prepare for potential challenges proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Disrupting Fundraising**: Patrick even used his competitive insights to influence venture capitalists considering investing in his competitors, presenting data that showed ProfitWell's superior metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:37:11]</a>.

## Broader Business Philosophy
Patrick emphasizes getting out of one's bubble to understand the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:02]</a>. He advocates for focusing on established, "unsexy" industries (like plumbing or HVAC "roll-ups") that may not be fads but have long-term staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:46]</a>. Innovation can come from applying one new approach (e.g., using Instagram for quilting) to a traditionally stable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:24:22]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Future Endeavors
### Bootstrapping Success and Reinvestment
Patrick's personal [[financial_transparency_and_lessons_from_personal_financial_journeys | financial journey]] highlights his commitment to [[selffunded_companies_and_cash_flow_management | bootstrapping]]; in January before the sale, he had only $20,000 in his bank account and a paid-off house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:44:03]</a>. He plans to reinvest his earnings from the ProfitWell sale, not into luxury items, but into learning and tackling significant societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:44:20]</a>.

### The "Publicly Traded Person" Experiment
As part of his "quickest path to learning" philosophy, Patrick is experimenting with a "hostile takeover" of Mike Merrill (K. Mikeym), the first publicly traded person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:53:32]</a>. Merrill sold shares in himself, allowing shareholders to vote on his life decisions (e.g., moving in with a girlfriend, taking an NFT project gig, or even endorsing a presidential candidate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:54:11]</a>. Patrick invested around $13,000 to acquire 1,930 shares out of approximately 5,000 voting shares, with the aim of gaining a controlling interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:49]</a>. He publicly announced his intention to take over, arguing it would increase the project's value, and despite the lack of legal obligation for Merrill to follow votes, he generally does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:59:03]</a>. This unusual experiment offers unique insights into shareholder dynamics, community engagement, and personal brand management.

### Impact of Wealth
Patrick notes that significant wealth "amplifies the worst in you and the best in you," as a person remains fundamentally the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:10]</a>. He believes in the "strenuous life" concept from Teddy Roosevelt, where those who have been given advantages or achieved success have a duty to continue striving, taking big swings, and tackling difficult problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:49:10]</a>. His current focus areas for future endeavors include:
*   **Debt**: Exploring the shadowy debt market to understand how it works and potentially forgive debt, especially student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:57]</a>. This aligns with [[discussion_on_recent_financial_trends_and_examples | financial tips and credit card strategies]].
*   **Money in Politics**: Investigating how to accelerate money in politics to break "log jams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   **Defense**: Supporting efforts to address inefficiencies like "cost-plus pricing" in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:40]</a>, which touches on [[security_startups_and_market_insights | security startups]].

### Personal Background and Skills
Patrick's childhood in Wisconsin, including milking cows, shaped his grounded perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:05:02]</a>. After college, he worked in US intelligence at the NSA before moving into tech in Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:38]</a>. He attributes his ability to synthesize information quickly and structure arguments to his background as a national champion debater in high school and college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:52:16]</a>. This skill was crucial in his early marketing strategy, where he rapidly produced deep blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:49]</a>.

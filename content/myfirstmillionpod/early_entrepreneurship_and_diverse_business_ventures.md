Michael Harris, known as Harry O, was a prolific entrepreneur from a young age, boasting 11 different businesses by the age of 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His ventures spanned various industries, showcasing an early and persistent [[entrepreneurship_and_early_success | entrepreneurial spirit]] and diverse business interests.

## Early Ventures and Business Acumen
Harris's first major business was a limousine service, which became quite profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. By the age of 23, his limousine company boasted approximately 30 luxury ultra-stretch cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He effectively managed bookings, often advertising extensively and then "farming out" excess business to other car services, earning a 50% commission on those transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Beyond the limousine service, his diverse portfolio of businesses included:
*   Construction companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Production companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Music companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Beauty salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Real estate investment companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

He also produced concerts and plays, and supported clubs in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. At its peak, Harris's collective businesses employed between 100 and 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, generating millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Foundations of Business Knowledge
Harris's [[early_business_experiences_and_challenges | early business experiences]] significantly shaped his entrepreneurial approach. As a child, around 11 to 13 years old, he worked at a shoe shine parlor in his neighborhood, learning about competition and how businesses were run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He keenly observed business owners, preachers, and even "people from the street," learning diverse approaches to business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This taught him not to "judge a book by its cover," recognizing potential clients beyond initial appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He always sought [[lessons_from_entrepreneurship | lessons]] from every experience, asking, "How do I use this moving forward?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

His mother, who owned a restaurant, also provided a direct example of effective business management, customer relations, and staff interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She even rose from working for the previous owners to acquiring the business herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Real Estate Investments
A core component of Harris's financial strategy was investing in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He sought out deals across various locations, purchasing both rehab properties, luxury properties, and business outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. At one point, he owned an estimated 30 to 40 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Transition to Entertainment
Harris's entry into the entertainment industry evolved from his existing ventures. He opened a studio called "The Jingle Factory" in a building he owned, producing commercials for local businesses and radio stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This brought him into contact with musicians, producers, and singers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. His limousine service also catered to production companies and artists, further connecting him to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

He established his own production company, "Why Not Production," to provide opportunities for individuals who looked like him, and who lacked the financial means to produce their own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This led him to produce plays, which he saw as a creative space for movie professionals between jobs and a way to bring entertainment to his community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He produced a play called "Checkmate," taking it to various cities and ultimately to Broadway with Anita Landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Business Philosophy
Harris's approach to business involved taking a managing partner role in his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. He prioritized learning everything about the specific business he invested in, combining that knowledge with his management skills to elevate the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This hands-on, learning-oriented approach was a consistent part of his [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurial journey]].

## Personal Challenges and Reflections
Harris's [[adventurous_business_ventures | adventurous business ventures]] included involvement in the drug business, where he stated his sales reached "two million a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. He reflects that while it was exciting and enterprising, it also destroyed his community and made him "poor in spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. He acknowledges that he was "young and misguided" in that venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

His life "came crashing down" when he was arrested and sent to prison, just as his Broadway play was about to fully launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. He was initially charged with attempted murder (later exonerated after 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>) and drug conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Despite being incarcerated for 33 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, Harris's entrepreneurial drive persisted.

### Founding Death Row Records from Prison
While in San Quentin, Harris helped establish Death Row Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. He described it as the "next iteration" of Ruthless Records, capitalizing on Dr. Dre's discontent with his previous situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Harris and his attorney, David Kenner, assembled the company while Harris was behind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. The name "Death Row" was inspired by Harris being housed on death row in San Quentin and witnessing younger individuals sentenced to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

Death Row Records, featuring artists like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac, quickly became a game-changer in the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. The label's success with albums like "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle" was rapid, selling millions of copies and influencing the music landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Harris saw this as a "legitimate venture" making significant money, a stark contrast to his past illegal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

## Legacy and Continuous Entrepreneurship
Harris's [[entrepreneurial_success_stories | entrepreneurial journey]] is marked by an enduring spirit, regardless of circumstances. He viewed Death Row Records as a "choo-choo train" that connected them to major companies like Universal and Warner Brothers, changing the game for many rappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. He is now the CEO of the new Death Row, which he helped create decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. He continues to embody the "creating something out of nothing" mentality, which he finds relatable between hip-hop entrepreneurs and tech innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. His story is a testament to the diverse and often [[unexpected_business_ventures_and_case_studies | unexpected business ventures]] one can undertake.

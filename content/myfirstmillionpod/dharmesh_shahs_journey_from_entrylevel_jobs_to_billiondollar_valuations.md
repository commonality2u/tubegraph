Dharmesh Shah, co-founder of HubSpot, has had a remarkable journey from humble beginnings to achieving significant entrepreneurial success, including [[founding_billiondollar_companies | founding billion-dollar companies]] and selling the domain `chat.com` to OpenAI for eight figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes increasing "leverage" and continuous self-investment to achieve financial and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Career and the Value of Leverage

Shah believes that it has never been easier to reach one's first million than it is right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. His own journey began in his early twenties after immigrating to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He faced rejections from jobs at Pizza Hut and Big Lots before landing a night shift position at a Red Roof Inn in Indiana, earning $3.65 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

He highlights that in the early stages of a career, individuals primarily convert their labor (time) into value (money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. To make more money at this stage, one can either work more hours or increase their "currency" â€“ the hourly rate for their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Investing in Oneself

A pivotal lesson for Shah was the necessity of increasing one's leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This means allocating a percentage of time or money to activities that improve personal value, even if they don't offer immediate monetary returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Shah committed 10% of his incoming money to self-improvement, such as buying books, to enhance his "currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

His highest return on investment came from reading books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He particularly found value in "pedestrian" business books by authors like Harvey McCay, such as "How to Swim with Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive" and "Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These books provided fundamental insights into how the world worked, which was crucial for someone who felt like an "alien from another planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Transition to Software Development and the Value Chain

After his motel job, Shah secured a programming role at U.S. Steel in Gary, Indiana, making approximately $27,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A key insight came from his manager, who stated, "if you're not making steel, shipping steel, transporting steel, moving steel, or selling steel, you're overhead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This led Shah to realize the importance of being closer to the core value creation of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

This realization prompted him to seek employment at a company where software *was* the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. He found a job at SunGard Data Systems in Birmingham, Alabama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. He observed that software companies treated developers significantly better than non-software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

At SunGard, Shah's role involved creating graphical user interfaces for mainframe products. Recognizing the rote nature of the work, he shrewdly hired his 17-year-old high school brother (who worked at Piggly Wiggly) for $5 an hour to perform the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He then hired his college classmates, demonstrating early leadership and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Within 14-18 months, his salary at SunGard skyrocketed to a quarter-million dollars a year in the early 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## The Art of Negotiation and Entrepreneurship

Shah's experience at SunGard taught him the power of negotiation. When asked if he thought he'd find many companies willing to pay him such a high salary, his measured response was, "I really don't need to find that many companies that will pay me $200,000 a year, I just need to find one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

He recommends "Getting to Yes" from the Harvard Negotiation Project, highlighting that most negotiations are not zero-sum games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The key is to identify your true needs and, critically, the other party's needs, to find an outcome that optimizes for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. For instance, in hiring, many individuals prioritize flexibility over compensation, which, if understood, can lead to better outcomes for both employee and employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Feeling he had hit a ceiling at SunGard, Shah realized he needed to get even closer to value creation by starting his own software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. His first startup was born from the simple idea of making developers happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Learning from "Failure" and Continuous Growth

Shah later embarked on a second startup called Captivo in 1999, which aimed to be a "Facebook for small business" or CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Unlike his first, which was "scrappy," he approached Captivo "the right way" by raising money and hiring more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. He invested over $1 million (and later stated about $2 million) of his own capital into Captivo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Despite the effort, Captivo failed to gain significant traction, particularly as the dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

He ultimately merged Captivo into his first startup and managed to break even on his investment, calling it a "very long putt to par" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This experience reinforced a powerful lesson: "Just because you were ignorant doesn't mean you were wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. His initial, instinctual, and resourceful approach to his first venture turned out to be more "right" than the more "sophisticated" approach of the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

Even with his success, Shah emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and skill development. He cites taking a power writing course as an example, demonstrating that "the return on time for developing writing I have not found the ceiling yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Writing, he believes, amplifies thinking, communication, pitching, and sales abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## "Nose for the Ball": Identifying Future Frontiers

Shah has a knack for identifying emerging technological "frontiers" where significant value is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   In the 1990s, he quickly moved into software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   In the 2000s, he started an internet company, followed by HubSpot, a cloud SaaS company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
*   Recently, he sold the domain `chat.com` to OpenAI, a move he saw as a "cover charge to get into the AI party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. He had bought it as a bet on the future of chat applications built on large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

Shah is now deeply focused on AI agents, which he describes as "AI software that can accomplish higher-level goals requiring multiple tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. He believes agents are the "new apps" and envisions a future with "hybrid teams" of humans and AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. This includes concepts like "results as a service" (RaaS), where companies sell outcomes rather than just software tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Mission

Despite his success, Shah remains grounded in his personal mission: "to help millions grow better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. He deliberately structures his role at HubSpot to avoid direct reports, allowing him to maximize his "build time" and engage in creative pursuits like writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

He emphasizes the concept of "connecting dots" (a la Steve Jobs), where seemingly unrelated experiences or skills collected over time eventually lead to unforeseen opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. Not every "dot" needs to work out; just a few successful ones can be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

He also references the idea of finding the "global maximum" rather than just a "local maximum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Sometimes, one must first climb a "smaller hill" (a local maximum) to gain the perspective needed to see the larger, more significant "mountain" (the global maximum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This implies taking initial steps that might not seem like the "big bet" but provide the necessary experience and vantage point for future, larger opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

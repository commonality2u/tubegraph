[[Rob Dyrdek's approach to health, wellness, and longevity | Rob Dyrdek]] views health and wellness as an integrated, evolving system, similar to his approach to [[rob_dyrdeks_business_evolution_and_strategy | business]] and [[rob_dyrdeks_ventures_and_investment_philosophies | venture creation]]. He aims for continuous self-optimization to achieve a state of consistent joy and extraordinary living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

## Evolution of Health Philosophy

Dyrdek's journey into health optimization began early, starting to optimize his blood work and conduct his first blood panel in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. By 2015, despite being in the "best shape" of his life, he was constantly achy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. This led to a pivotal decision to build a "perfectly structured physical system" without a set timeline, hiring a doctor to visit his home five days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

This intense focus allowed him to triangulate various therapies and gain deep knowledge of his body, including:
*   Every muscle and the fascial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>
*   Neurological deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>
*   Internal system issues like leaky gut and blood-brain barrier, which contribute to inflammation and diseases that reduce quality and length of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>

His approach is now "sophisticated" due to his holistic understanding of his body, mind, time, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## The "Peak Top" Transformation

Around nine months before the interview, Dyrdek experienced a significant psychological shift he calls "Peak Top," akin to a drug addict reaching "Rock Bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. This moment solidified his commitment, leading him to question why he would ever not maintain an "extraordinarily healthy" lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

Since this transformation, he has maintained an unwavering discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>:
*   Waking up at 5 AM daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
*   Daily gym workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   Daily meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
*   Eating clean and taking supplements daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   Eliminating alcohol, sugar, and snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

He tracks his "discipline numbers" (percentage of adherence to these habits) and "qualitative numbers" (how he feels about his life, work, and health on a scale of zero to ten). Both sets of numbers were at 100% and their highest ever, respectively, for the entire year, resulting in him feeling "extraordinary" every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This consistent state of joy leads to true happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.

## Key Health Practices

### Diet
Dyrdek emphasizes the profound impact of diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. His key dietary practices include:
*   **No alcohol** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>
*   **No sugar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>
*   **Intermittent fasting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>
*   **Eating lean protein and vegetable meals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>
*   **Avoiding processed foods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>

These dietary habits allow the body to clean itself, improve mental sharpness, deepen emotional control, and enhance the ability to make decisions and execute at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. He receives meal delivery from a local chef that is all organic and includes grass-fed beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

### Exercise and Movement
While specific exercises are not detailed, Dyrdek ensures he gets into the gym every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. His background as a professional skateboarder also highlights a lifelong engagement with physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Mental and Emotional Well-being
Meditation is a daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. Despite his optimized state, Dyrdek admits he still gets triggered and can become angry when his expectations are mismanaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. He is actively working to stop these triggers and get to a point where things don't even trigger him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>. When feeling "stuck" during deep work, his "soul" still desires pizza and wine, though he no longer acts on these impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

## Long-term Vision and Longevity
Dyrdek's long-term goal is to live one million hours, aiming for 114 years and 54 days of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:37">[01:58:37]</a>. He dedicates a significant amount of his wealth to understanding every aspect of his body and maintaining a deep longevity plan that allows him to enjoy life at a high level into old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. This focus aligns with the broader [[rich_peoples_approaches_to_health_and_longevity | trend among wealthy individuals]] investing in extending their lifespan and healthspan.

He views his journey as a continuous evolution, constantly assessing and adjusting to increase the probability of a better future experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. He aspires to be proof that one can reach a state of never getting angry, having no negative thoughts, and being completely harmonious and balanced in all relationships, time, health, and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Future Endeavors
Dyrdek is developing an "existence management system" software to help people manage their lives, optimize for high-energy present moments, and guide their lives to create higher probabilities of being healthier, happier, and wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This software will incorporate aspects of biofeedback and health customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>. He envisions future technologies, such as glucose monitors evolving to track dopamine and cortisol, becoming a cornerstone of understanding one's real-time emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

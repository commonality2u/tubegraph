The relationship between media and technology has undergone several significant shifts, moving from mutual ignorance to intense competition and a future where their functions may converge through decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>.

## Historical Context: Mutual Ignorance (1995-2008)

From approximately 1995 to 2008, the technology and media sectors largely operated in isolation from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
Media coverage of tech was positive up until the dot-com boom, but following the dot-com crash and 9/11, tech ceased to be a prominent news story for many years in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. At this time, Silicon Valley was not yet considered a major power center; Google was merely a search engine and Facebook a college social network, with the iPhone only just emerging in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Media's focus remained on events like the Iraq War and terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

Conversely, tech companies also largely ignored media due to the perceived failure of Terry Semel's attempt to transform Yahoo into a media entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This led a generation of tech founders to focus on building "neutral pipes" and platforms for user-generated content, such as Facebook, Dropbox, YouTube, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

## The Digital Shock and "Tech Lash" (2008-2019)

Following the 2008 financial crisis, a significant shift occurred. From 2008 to 2012, tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Apple experienced exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. During this period, print media revenues plummeted from about $65 billion to $17 billion, while Google and Facebook's advertising revenue surged, alongside the impact of Craigslist on classifieds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

While tech and media maintained an alliance until late 2012 (e.g., in electoral campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, "the knives came out" in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. Media corporations, unable to compete with tech in building products like search engines or social networks, began actively shaping narratives to portray tech as "bad" or "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This period, known as the "tech lash," saw media outlets aiming to "paint tech as bad as evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

This phenomenon highlights [[the_impact_of_media_on_his_career | the impact of media on his career]] of various entities, as media can "script humans just as code scripts machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Memes and narratives can spread like "contagious mental illness" through interconnected social networks, influencing public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## The Future: Decentralized Media and Quantifiable Truth

The speaker posits that the current era is a "third swing of the pendulum," where technology companies must now engage with media and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. The consequence of ignoring media is that "the story is told and you're the bad guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

The future of media, particularly in the context of [[future_trends_in_technology_and_business_development | future trends in technology and business development]], involves decentralized systems and a shift from traditional media's self-proclaimed "truth" to cryptographically verifiable facts. This transition is tied to:

*   **Digital Transformation**: The world is increasingly becoming digital, with physical goods being "printed out" through robotics and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Property, assets, and contracts are becoming digital, enabling new forms of tracking and verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Crypto Oracles**: These are decentralized data feeds that broadcast information on-chain, signing it as true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. Examples include temperature feeds for insurance or real estate transaction data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. These oracles receive micro-incentives for being accurate, creating an "empirical truths enforced by economics" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. This creates a "ledger of record" â€“ an unalterable, digital history of "what happened when" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Science**: This concept extends to scientific inquiry, where "math is actually more powerful than simple assertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:08">[02:20:08]</a>. Scientific papers would be fully reproducible from underlying data and code on a blockchain, allowing for independent replication and verification of claims, rather than relying on institutional "peer review" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>. This approach aims to address the problem of institutional capture and "ludicrous things" being asserted in the name of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>.
*   **Advocates**: Building on the "raw facts" provided by oracles, human "advocates" can create narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Their editorial judgment becomes quantifiable by revealing which facts they choose to include or omit, making the narrative "tangible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **New Business Models for Media**: The old subscription and advertising models in media are seen as flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. The shift to decentralized media aims to foster creators who are compensated for their work, moving beyond the "status games" of traditional social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. This aligns with [[impact_of_online_communities_and_influencer_marketing | the impact of online communities and influencer marketing]] by enabling direct earning from content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Decentralized Media Initiatives

The **1729.com** project exemplifies a new approach to media. It is a newsletter that pays users in cryptocurrency for completing "micro tasks" like creating memes or tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This initiative aims to allow users to "make money, learn things, [and] level up with technological progressives interested in building a positive future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It seeks to unify the roles of software engineers and content creators, who have historically been separated in traditional tech and media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

The project intends to bootstrap a diverse range of "influencers" and "pseudonymous voices" who are currently underrepresented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. The goal is to build consensus among these groups that technology is beneficial and can work across borders to create a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>. This platform could also be a place for companies to outsource tasks to the public and potentially pay them in corporate cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:01">[02:34:01]</a>.

This vision implies a fundamental change in [[insights_into_the_production_companies_and_media_industry | insights into the production companies and media industry]], suggesting that future media businesses will be decentralized and focused on verifiable facts and economically aligned incentives. This contrasts with traditional models, emphasizing a new form of [[balancing_traditional_and_new_media_ventures | balancing traditional and new media ventures]].

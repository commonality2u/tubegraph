Wealthy individuals have long prioritized health and longevity, a trend that continues to evolve with scientific advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Modern approaches often involve significant investments in cutting-edge research and personal health regimens.

## Sam Altman's Investments in Longevity
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and former head of Y Combinator, has invested nearly all of his liquid net worth into two companies: Helion Energy and Retro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Retro is a health company that caught attention for its focus on longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Altman himself expressed a desire to one day take Retro Health's yet-to-be-released medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

His daily routine for anti-aging is described as "mostly simple stuff" including eating healthy, exercising, sleeping enough, and taking Metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Metformin and its Role in Longevity
Metformin, a drug FDA-approved in the 1990s, was originally developed to help with insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar spikes in diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Researchers discovered a significant correlation between stable blood sugar levels and a longer lifespan, observing that diabetics taking Metformin often lived longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. This discovery led to its adoption by biohackers and ultra-wealthy individuals interested in longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, has also mentioned taking Metformin and Rapamycin for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Wealthy Health Practices
The focus on health among the wealthy is not new:
*   **John Rockefeller** (died 1930s-1940s) was meticulous about his food, chewing it to a liquid consistency, and adopted a vegetarian diet in his later years. He would even consult his doctor before eating a piece of chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Thomas Edison** focused on light eating, avoiding overeating, and taking daily naps as part of his health routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

The key difference in modern approaches is the application of advanced scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## Prominent Figures and Their Longevity Philosophies

### Peter Thiel
Peter Thiel, a prominent venture capitalist, holds a strong view against the acceptance of death. He believes that "the acceptance of death is a psychological defense mechanism" and dismisses it as "weird and sociopathic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. He actively pursues longevity through practices like taking Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and exploring parabiosis (a rumored practice involving young blood transfusions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Larry Ellison
Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a billionaire with a net worth over $50 billion, finds the concept of death perplexing. He states, "Death has never made any sense to me. How can a person be there and just vanish and just not be there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Brian Johnson and "Blueprint"
Brian Johnson, known for selling Braintree (which owned Venmo) and likely a billionaire, has gained notoriety for his "Blueprint" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This involves spending $2-3 million annually on a highly regimented diet (plant-based, no sugar) and exercise, with every aspect religiously measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

Johnson's program has inspired a subreddit where people mimic his regimen, showing high engagement and interest in his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

### The Rejuvenation Olympics
A new competition has emerged called the Rejuvenation Olympics, where participants aim to decrease their biological age compared to their chronological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Brian Johnson currently leads this leaderboard, which includes thousands of participants uploading their results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. The tagline for the competition is: "Where you win by never crossing the Finish Line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

This concept of measuring biological age is becoming more widely known, with services like InsideTracker allowing individuals to test their biological age for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. This presents a potential [[business_opportunities_in_longevity_and_healthcare | business opportunity]] for testing services, with strong upsell potential for nutrition, training, and medicine once individuals know their biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.

## The Influence of the Ultra-Wealthy on Health Trends
There's an observation that what "billionaires are doing like everyone else is going to want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This suggests that the longevity and anti-aging practices adopted by the ultra-wealthy may become more mainstream in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

> "Really rich people who have won at life and now they only think about big picture things and they're trying not to die because uh they got they got it pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>

The increasing popularity of drugs like Semaglutide (Ozempic), which rapidly sold out globally and became a topic on social media, indicates a growing public interest in weight loss and health interventions previously reserved for specific medical conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

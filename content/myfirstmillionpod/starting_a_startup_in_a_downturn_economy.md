Starting a startup during an economic downturn or recession can be a strategic move, offering unique advantages despite the challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05">06:05</a>. Industry experts offer [[advice_for_startup_founders_from_industry_experts | advice]] on why a "bad economy" might not be as detrimental as it seems for new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05">05:05</a>.

## Economic Impact on Startups

While the economic situation might appear grim, for a founder [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting a startup]], the economy may not matter significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">05:02</a>. As one expert puts it, a startup is like "an ant in this world" â€“ its focus should be on building a product and [[acquiring_first_customers_for_startup_businesses | getting customers]], regardless of the broader economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34">05:34</a>. If a startup cannot acquire 10 customers, it won't work anyway, regardless of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47">05:47</a>.

### Advantages of a Downturn
*   **Talent Availability**: During a recession, talent becomes more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21">06:21</a>. Individuals from larger companies (e.g., Meta, Google) or recently laid off from venture-backed firms may be re-evaluating their careers or seeking new opportunities, creating a pool of skilled labor that might not have been available before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24">06:24</a>.
*   **Lower Costs**: The glut of venture capital money flowing into the market during booming times tends to drive up costs for things like Google AdWords and other marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40">06:40</a>. In a downturn, this influx of money lessens, causing overall costs for essential entrepreneurial resources to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56">06:56</a>.
*   **Reduced Risk for Early Employees**: For early startup employees, the risk in a downturn might be perceived as lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48">14:48</a>. The mindset is that if the startup doesn't work out, they can "pick up where they left off" with minimal loss beyond the opportunity cost of a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50">14:50</a>.

## Startup Hiring Strategies

Startups typically cannot afford the high salaries seen in booming markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">07:50</a>. Founders must become adept at convincing smart people to join their venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01">08:01</a>.

Key hiring approaches include:
1.  **Attracting Superstar Talent**: Offer something beyond compensation, such as accelerated learning, exposure to many aspects of a business (a "startup MBA"), or the chance to meet future co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21">08:21</a>.
2.  **Identifying "Diamonds in the Rough"**: Focus on finding individuals who have not yet reached the highest salary brackets but possess immense potential and will someday earn top salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">08:38</a>. This is a form of arbitrage, leveraging future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">08:49</a>.

### Compensation Beyond Salary
Compensation for employees goes beyond just salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12">12:12</a>. Other valuable aspects include:
*   **Learning**: The knowledge and exposure gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18">12:18</a>.
*   **Network**: The connections built within the company and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20">12:20</a>.
*   **Emotional Value**: Enjoying the people you work with and the mission you are contributing to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34">12:34</a>.

One founder, Dharmesh, co-founder of Hubspot, shared that in the early days, he and his co-founder paid themselves $5,000 a month and set the same salary for the first few employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48">12:48</a>. The pitch was that if someone was "here for the salary, you're here for the wrong reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">13:08</a>. This strategy worked because the early team was largely "in-network" from MIT Sloan and were established enough not to be concerned about missing meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15">14:15</a>.

### Hiring Philosophy
*   **Smart People Who Get Stuff Done**: Prioritize individuals with high "wattage" (measurable intelligence) and a "predilection to action," meaning they are proactive in solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57">16:57</a>.
*   **Avoid "Press Release Hires"**: These are individuals whose hiring would compel a press release due to their extensive experience or prominent roles at large, established companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25">17:25</a>. Their specialized skills might not be relevant in a startup context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">17:50</a>.
*   **Embrace Uniqueness**: Seek out "weirdos" or "eccentric people" with strongly held, well-researched opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41">19:41</a>. Valuing "remarkability" and distinct qualities can lead to strong team chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28">20:28</a>.
*   **Obsession ("Degenerates")**: Look for people with a "borderline pathological obsession" with specific topics or competitive activities, even if they don't have a clear payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57">21:57</a>. This intensity can be redirected towards the startup's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41">22:41</a>.

## Hubspot's Downturn Strategy

Hubspot, a prominent software company, views economic downturns as opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15">06:15</a>.
*   **Defensive Measures**: This includes ensuring sufficient cash reserves to "weather the storm" and modeling potential impacts on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:20">59:20</a>.
*   **Capitalizing on Crisis**: The more exciting aspect is identifying ways to make the crisis "net positive" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34">59:34</a>. During the pandemic, Hubspot gave more value to customers and fronted cash to partners, strengthening relationships and the company's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52">59:52</a>.
*   **Counter-Cyclical Nature**: Hubspot's services can be counter-cyclical; in a downturn, businesses might seek more cost-effective solutions, leading them to consider Hubspot over more expensive incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">01:00:22</a>.

## The Trillion-Dollar Venn Diagram of Success

Success in entrepreneurship can be understood through a "trillion-dollar Venn diagram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">07:24</a>. This concept involves identifying your unique skills and finding the rare intersection of those skills that can be monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04">00:04</a>.

*   **Rare Skill Combinations**: Instead of being "one in a million" in a single skill, combining two or three distinct skills can make you "one in a billion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">07:29</a>. For example, a software developer with strong copywriting skills is a rare combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">01:09:10</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Skills**: When acquiring new skills, prioritize those that reinforce existing exceptional abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">01:08:51</a>.
*   **Courage to Act**: A crucial, often underestimated, ingredient for success is the courage to actually start and do the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">01:13:59</a>. People often overestimate difficulty or wait for validation, missing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">01:13:33</a>.
*   **Skill vs. Talent**: Most entrepreneurial tasks are skills that can be learned, not innate talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">01:15:05</a>. Even complex tasks can be broken down into simpler, solvable functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">01:15:35</a>.

## Iteration and Learning

[[Building a successful startup | Building a successful startup]] involves big dreams combined with small, tight feedback loops and continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">01:19:01</a>.
*   **Quantity over Initial Quality**: Producing many iterations, even if imperfect, often leads to better quality outcomes than aiming for perfection from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">01:19:26</a>. The act of repeated practice and learning from feedback drives improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.
*   **Meaningful Feedback**: Iteration is only valuable if there's a tight feedback loop that indicates whether progress is being made or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">01:20:31</a>.
*   **Marshmallow Challenge Analogy**: The "marshmallow challenge" demonstrates that groups that quickly build and test (iterating) outperform those that over-plan and delay implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">01:21:07</a>. The act of failing early and learning from it is key to identifying flaws in a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">01:23:22</a>.

## Case Study: Wordplay.com

Dharmesh launched a free online word game called Wordplay.com as a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">01:10:57</a>.
*   **Motivation**: He was motivated by personal interest (an avid Wordle player), a desire to learn new technologies (Vercel, Next.js, TypeScript), and primarily to teach his 11-year-old son about software development and its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">01:10:57</a>. He wanted his son to see that problems can be solved with software quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">01:10:57</a>.
*   **Development**: He built the game in Python over a single weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">01:10:57</a>.
*   **Features & Growth**: Wordplay offered unlimited play and a "challenge your friends" feature, which contributed to its viral spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">01:37:27</a>. It leveraged his existing social media following (1 million on LinkedIn, 300,000 on Twitter) and blog as a "flywheel" for initial traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">01:36:34</a>.
*   **Impact**: In several months, Wordplay.com saw 45 million games played and 9.5 million unique users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">01:36:16</a>. The average time spent per user increased from 4 to 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">01:41:26</a>.
*   **Monetization Potential**: He briefly enabled Google AdSense, demonstrating a potential revenue of $90,000 per month, though he later turned ads off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">01:38:32</a>. The estimated sale value for the project, if fully monetized, could be between $2 million and $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">01:40:27</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: The project taught him about traffic value, modern web frameworks, and community building around a user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">01:22:52</a>. He also explored integrating crypto rewards to onboard new users into the crypto world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">01:49:50</a>.
*   **Decision-Making**: For such a side project, a decision needs to be made: either escalate it into a full-fledged business or keep it as a personal project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">01:44:09</a>.

This example highlights how personal projects, even those started as learning exercises, can gain significant traction and demonstrate principles relevant to [[starting_a_business_with_no_capital | starting a business with no capital]] and [[effective_bootstrapping_techniques_for_startups | effective bootstrapping techniques for startups]]. It provides a tangible example of [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | startup ideas and opportunities]] that can emerge from passion and experimentation.

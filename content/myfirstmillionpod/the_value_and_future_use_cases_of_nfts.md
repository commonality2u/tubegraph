NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are digital assets recorded on a blockchain that represent ownership of unique items. Kevin Rose, an internet pioneer, has actively ventured into the world of [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] with his project "Proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

## Current Impact and Philosophy
Kevin Rose's NFT project, "Proof", has achieved "hundreds of millions of dollars worth of NFT sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. For him, the appeal of the [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFT]] and [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | cryptocurrency]] space is its "blue ocean" nature, where "there's just so much to be built" without the traditional competition of the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>.

### Content and Commerce Model
The success of Kevin's venture into [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] draws parallels to the "content and commerce" model observed in ventures like Hodinki, a luxury watch blog that grew to over $100 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. The core principle for both is building trust through strong editorial content. For Hodinki, this meant a "stellar team of writers" with "deep understanding of the World of Watches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>. This technical, hardcore writing "developed trust" with readers, which then allowed for the extension into commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:01">[03:34:01]</a>.

Similarly, "Proof" applies this "curation with a point of view" to [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]], focusing on "what would you buy and hold for the next decade plus" rather than quick speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>.

## Future Use Cases of NFTs

### Digital Art and Provenance
The "art one is easy" use case for [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]], representing a "new canvas" where art can be displayed in "unique fun creative ways" by pulling from real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:01">[05:54:01]</a>. The [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | blockchain]] provides "proven provenance," showing where a piece came from, and "proven scarcity," preventing duplicates or add-ons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:01">[07:39:01]</a>. This digital art can also incorporate dynamic elements like animation, oracles, or changes based on stock market prices, time of day, or moon phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:01">[07:52:01]</a>.

### Addressing Fraud and Improving Logistics for Physical Collectibles
One significant application for [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] is to solve problems in markets prone to forgery, such as high-end wine or luxury watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. An NFT can represent one physical bottle of wine, offering several advantages:
*   **No immediate possession required**: The physical item can remain in ideal storage conditions, aging and appreciating in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   **Elimination of fraud**: The NFT provides "proven ownership" and "eliminates fraud" by preventing forgeries and ensuring authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   **Streamlined transfer**: The NFT can be easily transferred or gifted, and the physical item can be delivered upon request by the holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>.

This model can be applied to "the watch industry, to the luxury world, to all these different verticals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>, increasing efficiency and trust in high-value secondary markets.

### Loyalty, Rewards, and Memberships
[[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] and the [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | blockchain]] can revolutionize loyalty and rewards programs. Instead of relying on a centralized company that might go out of business, loyalty data can be recorded on the [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | blockchain]], ensuring it's "forever on the chain" and not dependent on a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. This allows artists or businesses to engage with communities, offering token-gated content or exclusive access based on verifiable attendance or activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. For example, a rock star could grant VIP meet-and-greets to fans who have attended ten shows, with the attendance verified on the [[blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_applications | blockchain]] to prevent faking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

### Digital Ownership in Gaming and Beyond
In the gaming world, [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] enable true ownership of in-game assets, like "skins" or items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.
*   **Recouping investment**: If a player spends money on in-game items but later stops playing, they can "resell those items" and "recoup some of my investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>. This contrasts with current models where players "don't own those items" and "can't recoup any of that value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   **Interoperability**: [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] could allow items to "move between platforms" or be used in "multiple games" if other games accept the same protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. This makes the digital assets "more valuable because they can be used in more places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

## User Experience and the Future
Kevin Rose believes that in the long term, over "90 plus percent of people that interact with [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]]... won't even know it as they're doing it as an [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFT]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. It will simply be an underlying technology, akin to how users don't need to understand how email works to benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. The focus will be on the improved user experience, such as free and instant communication, or the ability to easily search digital content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

Ultimately, [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] are "just another database," specifically a "distributed immutable database that is decentralized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>, which "unlocks a bunch of fun new use cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Kevin acknowledges that not every use case is groundbreaking for the average person, but the technology offers "great advantages" in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

Sarah Moore, a Harvard Business School graduate, defied conventional wisdom to acquire a multi-million dollar business, eggcartons.com, with no money down and limited experience. Her journey provides a compelling blueprint for [[making_strategic_acquisitions_for_growth | business acquisition]] through unconventional methods and sheer determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Why Acquire a Business?
Traditionally, discussions revolve around starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, as noted by Andrew Wilkinson, [[selling_companies_and_acquisitions | buying a business]] can often be a superior path to entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For Sarah, the concept of a "search fund" – acquiring an existing business and becoming its CEO without prior capital or experience – was particularly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This contrasts sharply with high-pressure corporate careers like investment banking, where employees might work 24/7 with strict 15-minute response times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Sarah sought a path where she could be her "own boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## The Search Process: An Unorthodox Approach
Sarah's search for a business to acquire was methodical yet highly unconventional, embracing a "numbers game" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

### Initial Strategy & Challenges
Despite her Harvard MBA, Sarah found that traditional corporate finance education didn't equip her for evaluating small, "grungy" businesses like a commercial window washing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. She initially considered the investor route, where investors would pay her to search, but found the payback terms (1.5x the search capital) "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Instead, a friend advised her that with "enough reps in," she would "not not recognize a good business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, leading her to decide to go it alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Leveraging Interns
Lacking funds for technology or extensive travel, Sarah's first step was to "leverage what I've got around me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> by recruiting a team of interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. She hired many of her first interns from Craigslist, finding them more effective than "cookie cutter students" from student job boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

To attract interns, she pitched the opportunity as "private equity experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> and offered full transparency into all calls with owners, brokers, accountants, and attorneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. She also provided letters of recommendation and help with recruiting, interviewing, and grad school prep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>. Her job post for Kenston Green, her self-styled "unorthodox private equity firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, highlighted an "eccentric, unpretentious Harvard MBA" boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a> and promised no time-wasting tasks like financial modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. To house her interns, she even acquired fake student IDs to access university libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

### Outreach Strategy
Initially, the team attempted a painstaking industry-specific approach, requiring each intern to find 50 companies a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Recognizing their low response rate and inefficient filtering, they shifted to a mass outreach strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. They generated potential email addresses using common patterns (e.g., `firstname.lastinitial@domain`) and verified them with a bulk email checker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

They sent generic, seemingly customized emails stating they were looking for a business that "perfectly fit the bill" because it was within a certain revenue range, had been around for a long time, and was consistently profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This allowed sellers to self-select: those who disagreed helped refine the data, while those who were impressed with the "research" would contact them, giving Sarah and her interns time to "scramble" and learn about the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

Sarah also employed unique [[marketing_and_sales_strategies_for_new_businesses | marketing and sales strategies for new businesses]] to generate inbound leads, such as attending broker events in 5-inch heels and "ridiculous outfits" to be memorable, and wearing a sweatshirt that read "I want to buy your business" with her number on the back while biking around Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. She even sent mass faxes with her picture, a strategy she notes still leads to people recognizing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.

### Criteria Evolution: Profitability Over Industry
Sarah initially targeted businesses with revenues between $4 million and $20 million and EBITDA (seller earnings) at or above $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. However, she quickly realized that the industry was "absolutely irrelevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

[!NOTE]
"What matters is that you find a business that is established and has been consistently profitable for a number of years. Everything else, garbage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

She lowered her expectations and widened her search to focus solely on established, consistently profitable businesses, even if they were in seemingly "boring" or "unstable" industries like steel or e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## The Acquisition of Eggcartons.com
After a year of searching through 100,000 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, Sarah found eggcartons.com.

### Identifying the Target
The owner's initial email, expressing surprise at her "research," immediately piqued Sarah's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. The key factors that made the business stand out were its consistent profitability since 2001, strong reputation, and robust customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
Only about 5% of the businesses Sarah and her team looked at were consistently profitable and established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

[!INFO]
Eggcartons.com was a wholesale distributor of egg cartons, buying, storing, and selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. What made it desirable were proprietary products and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. The simplicity of the business, where she could "walk into and day one more or less get it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, was a key strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Negotiation and the Seller's Note
Sarah's negotiation approach was direct: she would immediately ask for a tentative price range based on multiples of profit, usually 3-4x, and ensure the seller was within a realistic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. She avoided jargon, preferring terms like "income" over "EBITDA" to keep conversations simple and build trust with sellers who might not have high school degrees but were "very good at business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

A non-negotiable for Sarah was a "seller's note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. This means the seller finances a portion of the purchase price over time. For example, in a $1 million deal with a 25% seller's note, the buyer pays $750,000 upfront, and the remaining $250,000 is paid over an agreed period with interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. Sarah used the argument: "If your business is so great and simple enough for me to operate, why would you have an issue doing a seller's note?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. She chose not to include earn-outs or performance-based clauses to keep terms "extremely straightforward" and avoid making sellers skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Financing with No Money Down
Sarah bought the multi-million dollar business with "all debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, putting in "no money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Her structure was a 25% seller's note and a 75% bank note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. She approached over 20 banks to find one that viewed the seller's note as "equity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>, allowing them to lend the remaining 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. The bank's willingness was largely based on the business's many years of consistent profitability, as they had priority over the seller's note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Growth and Lessons
After the acquisition, Sarah initially made "quite a few mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. Her mentor's advice: "Hire and fire fast," and "Do not change anything big or really anything at all the first year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Sarah admits to making the mistake of changing phone systems, which led to a week of downtime and customer confusion, highlighting how seemingly small changes can have a "pretty big" impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

### Market Redefinition & Growth
Sarah initially focused on the "egg industry" but soon realized through analyzing order history that customers were using egg cartons for various non-egg products like crickets, roaches, small parts, bath bombs, and cupcakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. She estimates that 40% of their revenue now comes from non-egg related sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

[!TIP]
Sarah discovered that her business was not just in the "egg industry" but in "specialty packaging," defined as "anything requiring protection and separation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This broader market definition unlocked enormous growth potential.

Her strategy focused on leveraging proprietary products and customs molds, which created "sticky" customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The business "five-sixxed" during COVID-19, partly due to recognizing market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. The company is now in the process of acquiring new domain names like "machine shop trays" and "bath bomb cartons" to reflect its broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Philosophy
Sarah's journey highlights several crucial elements for [[marketdriven_business_growth_and_acquisition_strategies | business growth and acquisition strategies]]:

*   **Persistence and "Numbers Game"**: Sarah's acquisition was a result of looking at a massive number of businesses and contacting them relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. The belief that "it is not a matter of can or can't, it's a matter of will or won't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a> is central to her success.
*   **Don't Count Yourself Out**: Despite coming from a challenging background and not having a "traditional" path to Harvard Business School (e.g., paying her sister to take her SATs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>), Sarah refused to believe she couldn't achieve her goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Open-Mindedness**: Her willingness to discard preconceived notions about industries and financial models, and to adapt her search criteria, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Playing to Strengths**: Sarah deliberately leveraged her appearance and direct communication style to stand out in a male-dominated broker community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **"Ignorance is Bliss"**: Avoiding jargon and keeping terms simple in negotiations built trust and facilitated deals with sellers who might not have formal business education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Value of Mentorship**: Key turning points in Sarah's life and career were influenced by individuals who invested in her, notably Natalie Bracken who adopted her and provided stability, and Steve, her former boss, who paid for her college and encouraged her to pursue business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. This inspired her philosophy of "be that one person for one person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a> through one-on-one mentorship, especially for those pursuing [[investment_strategies_and_venture_creation | business ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

Sarah believes that the acquisition route is a viable path to freedom and the "American dream" for "anyone who wants to buy and operate a small business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>, regardless of background or formal education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

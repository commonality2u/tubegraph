He built one of Australia's largest growth agencies starting with just a laptop and no resources or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This article compiles his insights on [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | business opportunities]] and [[marketing_and_sales_strategies_for_new_businesses | strategies]] for the next 18 months, particularly for those starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Godfather Offer Strategy

A "Godfather Offer" is a compelling, "no-brainer" proposal that a prospect simply cannot refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Businesses that achieve rapid growth often do so by having a very strong offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The key is to make an offer so attractive that it eliminates the need for a convincing argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Examples of Godfather Offers

*   **Cross-Platform Advertising Management**
    Many businesses focus on one traffic channel (e.g., Google Ads) but neglect others like Facebook Ads or TikTok due to lack of team or expertise, or past failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The opportunity lies in approaching these businesses and offering to manage a new platform (e.g., TikTok for those on Meta Ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **The Pitch:** "I'll build the funnel, run the ads, and show you it works – all at no upfront cost. I just want a percentage (e.g., 10%) of the sales from this new traffic channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This eliminates their risk.
    *   **Key Consideration:** Different platforms (e.g., TikTok and Facebook) have different compliance requirements, which you would handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Shopify to Amazon Integration for E-commerce**
    Many successful Shopify stores are not leveraging Amazon due to operational complexity or lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **The Pitch:** Identify Shopify stores (using tools like SimilarWeb to check traffic) that aren't on Amazon. Research their competitors on Amazon to show potential monthly revenue (e.g., "$1 million a month on Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Offer to manage their Amazon FBA presence, starting simply and scaling up, for a percentage of sales. The business doesn't even need to ship items to Amazon initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A single person proficient in Amazon FBA can manage multiple clients, generating significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **Affiliate Marketing for SaaS Products**
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies like HubSpot or Hyros offer substantial affiliate commissions (e.g., HubSpot pays 30% recurring for up to a year, Hyros pays $1,000 to $15,000 per customer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   **The Approach (Two-step system):**
        1.  Choose a niche (e.g., chiropractors) and build a complete, high-converting marketing funnel (landing page, email flows, offer, text messages) for that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
        2.  Reach out to businesses in that niche (via cold outreach or calls) and offer the pre-built funnel for free (which usually costs thousands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
        3.  The "catch" is that they must sign up for the necessary SaaS product (e.g., HubSpot) through your affiliate link to host the leads generated by the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   This provides free, ready-to-use marketing for the business, while you earn commissions without operating or maintaining the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **Live Chat as a Service**
    Many small businesses, despite having Google My Business listings and traffic, lack live chat support, especially after hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
    *   **The Pitch:** Offer to provide live chat services for free. Use their Google My Business listing to show how much traffic they get when they're closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   Explain you will field, nurture, and send leads to their sales team (or even close sales via chat), taking a 20% commission on sales generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
    *   This can start as a side hustle, then scale by hiring remote staff in places like the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This works best for businesses already running ads or ranking high on Google, as they have traffic to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Mindset for Starting a Business

When starting, the primary goal should be to replace your income (e.g., aiming for $10K/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Focus on acquiring skills with a long half-life, not just fleeting trends. For example, while Facebook Ads change rapidly, core skills like copywriting, consumer psychology, video editing, and storytelling are timeless and compound over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This allows you to get paid to learn valuable, horizontal skills applicable to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

## Leveraging New Platforms for Sales

### TikTok Shop & YouTube Shopping Affiliate Model

TikTok Shop is experiencing massive growth in social commerce, and YouTube Shopping is also gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Brands offer affiliates a percentage of sales generated through product tags on their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Use tools like Cow Data or Fast Moss to find best-selling products on TikTok Shop, analyze their revenue, and review the viral videos used to sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    2.  Reverse-engineer the scripts from successful videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    3.  Use AI tools: Eleven Labs for voiceovers (no need to show your face or use your voice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, and Midjourney or other free AI generation tools for images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    4.  Combine these elements using video editing software like CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   **Case Studies:**
    *   **Shilajit Resin:** A black tar supplement from the Himalayas, marketed with outrageous claims (e.g., doubling testosterone, increasing "pencil size") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. One company, Better Al Himalayan Shilajit Resin, sold 91,000 units in 90 days on TikTok Shop, generating almost $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Many ads used AI voices and AI-generated imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
    *   **Gurunanda Oil Pulling Kit:** Also exploded on TikTok, doing 100,000 units a week with 40,000 reviews and 30,000 tagged videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. These products often have an ancient, story-based narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Dual Opportunity:**
    1.  Start as an affiliate to learn copywriting, attention-grabbing hooks, social currency, and what goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
    2.  Transition to offering services to businesses: Charge a retainer (e.g., $20K/month) plus a percentage of sales to build out TikTok Shop as a platform for them, handling all creatives and ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. A key selling point is that viral TikTok creatives can then be repurposed for Facebook ads, addressing a common bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Showmanship and Storytelling

Showmanship is the currency that buys the attention of your prospects and marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. It involves storytelling, stage presence, energy, and visual storytelling to add drama and excitement to what might otherwise be ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. This is crucial as businesses are ultimately in the "people business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

*   **Impact on Marketing:** Injecting fun and outrageousness into campaigns can significantly boost results. For example, an ad campaign featuring a funeral for "murdered money" in ad campaigns, dressed as a priest, tripled sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **The "Yes, Yes, Yes, No" Funnel:** This strategy involves providing immense value and education upfront without immediately asking for a sale. The goal is to get the prospect to affirm "yes, yes, yes" to the value, logic, and expert advice being offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. By the end, they are convinced of your expertise but then arrive at the "no" conclusion for themselves – "no, I don't have the time, energy, or skill to do this myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. This leads them to enlist your services, acknowledging your expertise without being directly pushed into a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
    *   **Example (Free Book):** Giving away a free book (e.g., "Sell Like Crazy") teaches people how to market, but the underlying goal is to convert those who realize they'd rather have an agency do it for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. The book must genuinely deliver value, not be a "thinly veiled sales pitch," to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

## Repeatable Sales Systems

Most businesses lack a predictable, repeatable way to turn a dollar into multiple dollars in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. Without this, a business is merely an "expensive hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

*   **Lead Generation Funnel:**
    1.  **Value First:** Instead of a direct "get a quote" approach, offer a piece of valuable content (e.g., a free report, video) that educates the target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. This "bait" encourages them to "raise their hand" and express interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.
    2.  **Two-Step Funnel:** Once they download the free content, they land on a page where you present your "Godfather Offer" to get them on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This significantly increases the volume of people willing to engage with your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
    *   **Content Marketing for Products:** Brands are increasingly using organic-looking content that slides under the radar as a sales message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. They start with an interesting fact or story, optimized by the algorithm, and only make the product pitch at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
        *   **Example:** A video about "20 things to build inside your house" leads to a course on flipping homes to afford those features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy: Embracing Fun and Silly Things

Sabri emphasizes the importance of having more fun in both life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. This shift in focus led to increased financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

*   **Kill the Little Bitch Inside:** This refers to silencing the inner voice that whispers doubts, fears, and excuses, especially when attempting difficult tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The more challenging the task, the louder this voice gets. The strategy is to not only ignore it but to penalize it with *more* effort than originally planned, teaching it what is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   **Plan for Fun:** Just as work is planned, so should fun. Schedule holidays and new experiences in advance, rather than waiting until you "need" a break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This provides "juice" and "zing" that translates into more productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Planning annual trips to new countries, and using ChatGPT to create children's storybooks about the destinations, incorporating family names, to build excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Talk to Strangers:** Strangers can become wives, customers, business partners, or best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.
*   **"What's New?" vs. "What Are You Excited About?"**
    "What's new?" often elicits mundane responses and a sense of disappointment. A better question for small talk is "What's something you're excited about coming up?" This makes people light up and reveals their aspirations and planned fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Age Doesn't Mean Boring:** The implicit belief that getting older means becoming more boring is a default that needs to be uprooted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Continuing to do new things and taking "big swings" keeps life energized and avoids cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. The goal is to "make the ordinary extraordinary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   **Play vs. Work:** Do things that feel like play to you but look like work to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This leads to doing things longer, getting better, and seeing improved results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
    *   Google's "20% time" (employees spend 20% of work time on unrelated projects) and Facebook's "hackathons" are examples of fostering creativity and fun within work, leading to major innovations like the "Like" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
    *   Allocating a "do cool shit budget" (e.g., 10% of marketing budget for non-ROI measurable plays) allows for big, out-of-the-box ideas that might be big winners or simply provide learning and creative release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
    *   As Tim Ferriss noted, charging your batteries with "silly things" allows you to have more energy for "productive" work later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

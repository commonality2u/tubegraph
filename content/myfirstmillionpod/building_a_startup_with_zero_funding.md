When [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting a company from scratch]], a key question is defining priorities, especially when operating with minimal or [[starting_a_business_with_no_capital | no capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A common, yet often less effective, approach prioritizes building an "awesome team," recruiting high-level people, and establishing a cultural foundation before generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This can involve extensive off-sites, mission statements, values, and professional photographers, all without a launched product or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In contrast, a "bootleg" style of [[building_a_successful_startup | company building]] emphasizes immediate, impactful actions over elaborate foundational work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This approach believes that while multiple "play styles" can lead to success, most individuals should default to a lean, action-oriented strategy rather than assuming they are a "visionary genius" like Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Prioritizing Core Actions

When building a startup with zero funding, the immediate focus should be on the essentials:

### Validate Demand: Do People Want It?
The primary action is to determine if there's a market for the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This can be achieved through:
*   **Pre-selling:** Offering a product or service for sale before it's fully developed. For instance, a small copywriting service generated $5,000 in pre-sales, while another product, Trends, secured $50,000 in pre-sales and later $100,000 for a higher-priced offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Customer interviews:** Conducting numerous phone calls to gauge interest and gather feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Landing pages:** For products under $1,000 in transactional value, creating a landing page for pre-sales within a month can be an effective first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Gut feeling:** Sometimes, based on experience or market insight, an entrepreneur may have a strong intuition about demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Acquire Customers: How Will You Get Them?
The second crucial step is identifying a repeatable way to acquire customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This involves understanding how to get the first 10, then 100, and ultimately a consistent flow of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Actively Avoid Distractions
Once demand and customer acquisition methods are identified, all other activities—such as raising money, elaborate company culture, extensive hiring, corporate structure, naming, branding, or packaging design—should be actively avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Engaging in these "sideways" activities can feel like progress but distracts from the essential "hard stuff" of building and selling a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Mindset for Bootstrapped Success

A particular mindset supports this lean approach:

*   **"Bully Management" of Values:** Instead of just stating values like "building things fast," embody them by creating an environment where rapid shipping and customer delivery are paramount. For instance, developers who didn't push code live were playfully called "localhost" until they shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Similarly, tracking daily active users rigorously ensures focus on key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Peter Thiel, at PayPal, reportedly enforced focus by leaving conversations if employees discussed anything beyond their single assigned priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

*   **Action Over Perfection:** The bias should always be towards action and shipping, even if the product is not perfect. Recording six podcast episodes before launching the first one is an example of delaying crucial market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The goal is to get something out quickly to see if users "actually love it" or just "kind of like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

*   **Attracting "Winners":** Focus on attracting individuals who are action-oriented, optimistic, and have energy to build, rather than those who find reasons not to do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This can be done through initiatives that reward builders and create a community around getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## Legal Structure Considerations

When contemplating the longevity and exit strategy of a business, the legal entity choice becomes important:
*   **LLC (Limited Liability Company):** Suitable if the intention is to pay oneself from the business on an ongoing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **C Corp (C Corporation):** Preferable if the goal is to sell the company in the future, especially to take advantage of benefits like Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS), which can provide significant tax savings after five-plus years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. A common structure involves a C Corp owning the business assets (for QSBS eligibility) and paying an LLC (for founders' personal income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **S Corp (S Corporation):** Also an option, but generally less favorable for future sales and QSBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### GetCyberLeads.com
Alex West's GetCyberLeads.com is a prime example of a lean, high-value business run by one person and a virtual assistant (VA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. The service provides hand-picked leads of recently funded companies likely to outsource, offering clear value to agency owners for a subscription fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. It's a [[bootstrapping_a_saas_company | bootstrapped SaaS company]] with high-profit margins because the value proposition is immediate and tangible, directly leading to more customers and revenue for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

### The Builder Grant Program
A founder created a grant program offering $3,000 with "no strings attached" to builders in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. This initiative, inspired by a belief that "winners exist," attracted nearly a thousand applications and garnered additional funding from other "winners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. It serves as a way to attract ambitious, energetic individuals into a network, potentially yielding long-term ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. This demonstrates how even with limited initial funds, leveraging a network and a compelling vision can attract talent and resources, effectively [[starting_a_business_with_no_capital | starting a business with no capital]].

### Community Building (Beer Mixers)
Organizing regular, low-cost community events, like spending $500 a week on beer mixers for two years, can build significant social capital and popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. This demonstrates that strategic, consistent, low-cost engagement can yield substantial relationship-building, which is vital for [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | building successful businesses from scratch]].

Ultimately, [[starting_a_business_from_scratch | starting a business from scratch]] with zero funding requires brutal prioritization, focusing on validation and customer acquisition, and actively resisting the temptation to engage in activities that don't directly contribute to these core goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This lean, action-oriented approach helps to identify quickly whether an idea has potential, enabling adaptation or quick failure without significant capital expenditure.

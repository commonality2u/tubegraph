There are two main ways to make a million dollars: one that stays a million, and another that has the potential to scale to a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Sarah, an investor with a $100 million fund in [[AI business ideas|AI startups]], highlights key [[Business opportunities with ChatGPT and AI tools|AI business ideas]] and strategies for building ventures that can achieve significant scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## AI as the "New Drop Shipping"

A significant opportunity in the current AI landscape is likened to the Drop Shipping phenomenon of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Just as Drop Shipping leveraged existing manufacturing and logistics (e.g., Alibaba, AliExpress) without requiring product creation or warehousing, modern AI businesses can leverage powerful AI models (e.g., OpenAI) without needing to build the core technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The focus shifts to internet distribution and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of the "AI Drop Shipping" Model:
*   **Leveraging Existing Models:** AI companies like OpenAI provide the "magic" that can turn text into video or song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Marketing:** Entrepreneurs can specialize in the "marketing bit" to deliver AI-powered products or services to customers without developing the underlying AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Niche Applications:** Success comes from figuring out internet distribution and applying powerful models to solve useful problems in specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Specific [[AI business ideas|AI Business Ideas]] and Examples

### Copy Editing
AI models can generate reasonable copy, enabling businesses to create platforms with templates, good SEO, and payment integration to offer copy generation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Copy.ai and Jasper started with this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Jasper, for instance, scaled to $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in one year by combining AI capabilities with strong internet marketing and paid ad strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### AI Companionship Apps
These apps provide digital companionship, fulfilling a basic human need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs, even without deep AI expertise, are generating significant cash flow (e.g., $1 million) from such apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Replika:** A well-known digital companion, reportedly doing around $50 million a year in revenue with a cash-efficient business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Character.AI:** Has over 310 million monthly unique visitors (according to Similarweb), demonstrating immense user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Users spend hours on these apps, akin to engagement seen with social media or platforms like Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Video Avatar/Generation
New AI capabilities allow for the creation of video avatars that are indistinguishable from real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
*   **HeyGen:** Enables users to create video avatars of themselves, suitable for corporate use cases like training videos or customer outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:01]</a>. HeyGen quickly reached tens of millions in revenue without paid marketing, driven by the shareability of its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. This technology is production-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> and continually advancing, allowing for movement and varied scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **icon.me:** Creates AI-generated user-generated content (UGC) ads for direct-to-consumer (DTC) products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. Influencers can create digital twins to approve branded content requests, automating the process of filming and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.
*   **Arcades:** Similar to icon.me, but uses completely fake AI-generated actors to promote products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

*   **AI Phone Agents:** Every small business, from pest control to restaurants, can benefit from an AI agent that answers calls, provides information (e.g., hours of operation), qualifies leads, and even pre-sells services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. This eliminates the problem of missed calls and allows human sales staff to focus on more bespoke interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Bland.ai enables the creation of phone agents for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.

### Next-Gen Autocomplete
Beyond basic spelling and grammar, AI can learn a user's unique voice and writing style to generate emails or blog posts that sound authentic to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>. This addresses the common issue of generic AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** Superhuman's AI features are an early example of this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>.

*   **Examples:** Abridge, Nabla, and Freed are growing rapidly in this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. This aligns with the idea that AI will take over specific "tasks" rather than entire "jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.

### [[AI in education and learning|AI in Education]]
AI can create personalized, interactive learning experiences, potentially providing every student with a personal tutor that feels like the most amazing expert in a domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Successful [[Building a business using AI tools|AI Businesses]]

*   **Software 3.0:** This concept describes the next generation of software, where the focus is on manipulating powerful "Foundation Models" rather than training models from scratch or extensive data labeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>. Entrepreneurs can guide these models with specific business information to serve niche use cases, which collectively form large markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.
*   **Novelty Drives Word-of-Mouth:** The unique and powerful capabilities of AI applications naturally generate excitement and sharing, leading to organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution and Marketing Prowess:** Companies like Jasper succeeded rapidly because their founders were expert internet marketers who knew how to optimize paid advertising funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.
*   **Product Velocity and Depth:** To scale from an initial "wedge" (a powerful solution for a single use case) to a billion-dollar business, continuous investment in product depth and expansion of scope is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. This involves traditional business principles like product velocity, ability to serve customers, and fostering social engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

*   **Scaling Beyond the Initial Hit:** While an initial "wedge" may lead to quick revenue, sustained growth requires deeper product development and traditional business fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. Without it, a business might become a "treadmill" that requires constant input of money and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>.
*   **Compute Monopoly and Data Center Changes:** The shift to AI workloads will require massive investments in chips, memory, bandwidth, networking, and energy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>. This represents trillions of dollars of value at stake and opens opportunities for specialized solutions beyond just competing with Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.
*   **Societal Impact:**
    *   **"Halves and Have-Nots" Gap:** There's a concern that AI could widen the gap between those with capital and those without, although the belief is that [[Utilizing AI in daily business operations|AI can increase productivity]] for people in many jobs, not just the highest paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Doom Scenario (P_Doom):** While some experts worry about existential risks like AI designing viruses or taking over resources, others argue there's no clear linear path to such scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>. A greater immediate concern is the understanding of true information and the potential for AI abuse in hacking and fraud through authentic-sounding media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Economy of Abundance:** The focus should be on exploring how cheap intelligence can lead to an economy of abundance, improving sectors like healthcare, government, and education that have resisted cost improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.

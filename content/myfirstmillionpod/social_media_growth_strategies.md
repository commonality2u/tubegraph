Successful engagement and expansion on social media platforms involve understanding platform dynamics, identifying arbitrage opportunities, and consistently providing value to an audience. This approach can lead to significant [[leveraging_internet_platforms_for_business_growth | business growth]] and [[building_a_personal_brand_for_business_growth | personal brand development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Core Principles for Growth

### Identifying Arbitrage Opportunities
Early identification of less saturated platforms or content formats can yield substantial growth. For example, Twitter threads were once a "legitimate Arbitrage in writing quality threads" for audience growth before they became a saturated "thread boy meme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Similarly, LinkedIn currently presents a "massive Arbitrage opportunity" for audience growth compared to the more saturated Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

### Content Pillars and Consistency
Establishing two or three consistent content pillars is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For founders, these might include sharing insights on building companies, industry knowledge, or displaying vulnerability by sharing "losses along the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This consistent value delivery is key to [[building_an_audience_and_content_creation | audience building]] and ultimately being able to "harvest value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

### Vulnerability and the Pratfall Effect
Sharing imperfections can make creators more endearing to their audience, a phenomenon known as the "Pratfall effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. People tend to like those they perceive as perfect more when they show "chinks in their armor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Adapting to Platform Changes
The digital landscape is constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation. Content that "works" on one platform or at one time may become "cringe" or saturated later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. Being early to a market is beneficial, but ongoing success requires adapting and "figuring out the new way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### LinkedIn Growth Agency
A significant [[opportunities_in_current_digital_platforms | opportunity in current digital platforms]] is a LinkedIn growth agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
- **Strategy**: Convert proven tweets (or blog content) into carousels on LinkedIn using tools like Tweetpic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This format is a "big growth hack on LinkedIn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
- **Service Offering**: Manage a client's entire LinkedIn presence, posting two to three times a week without them needing to open the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
- **Monetization**: Charge a success fee based on follower growth or a monthly retainer (e.g., $2,500-$5,000 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. This offers "awesome Arbitrage opportunity" due to low time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
- **Target Audience**: Founders and business builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. LinkedIn is valuable for recruiting and generating business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
- **Case Study**: Justin Welsh, a "Godfather LinkedIn influencer," earns over $100K a month from courses promoted primarily through LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

### Instagram Growth
Repurposing viral tweets into Instagram content can drive significant follower growth and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. Even accounts that "never show their face" can achieve high revenue (e.g., $50K-$100K) by posting carousels of images and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This can drive newsletter subscriptions or [[successful_ecommerce_strategies_using_social_media_platforms | e-commerce sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

### Mobile Podcast & Video Studio
A "mobile podcast and video studio" in vans could be a viable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
- **Setup**: Equip normal-sized vans with DSLR cameras, dual-camera setups, and mics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Add appealing backgrounds, lighting, and neon signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
- **Service**: Rent out for podcast recordings ($500 for two hours) or for filming Instagram shorts and [[building_a_successful_brand_with_tiktok | TikToks]] (a couple hundred bucks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
- **Model**: Operate in major cities, moving locations to avoid rent costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. Could function as a membership for regular access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.

## Considerations for Content Creators

### Balancing Authenticity and Algorithm
While strategies like "thread boy" content or "listicles" can lead to rapid growth, they can also be perceived as "cringe" or "soul-sucking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. The key is to determine "what percent cringe are you willing to be" to optimize for the algorithm versus maintaining authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. Figures like GaryVee, Tony Robbins, and Grant Cardone are examples of individuals who "get hate because it freaking works and it helps people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision vs. Short-Term Gains
Content creators should consider their "long-term game" and how current strategies "vault" them into a desired future position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Short-term tactics can serve as a stepping stone to build a brand that extends into more substantial ventures like newsletters, funds, or book deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

### Newsletter Growth Service
There is an identified gap for a "full suite growth service for your newsletter" that handles everything from landing page optimization, referral networks, newsletter swaps, paid ads, SEO, and social channel optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. Successful founders and entrepreneurs with existing capital are willing to pay significant amounts (e.g., $10K per month) for such a service, as they prioritize growth over immediate revenue generation for their newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. This represents an opportunity for a "high-margin" business by leveraging a killer operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

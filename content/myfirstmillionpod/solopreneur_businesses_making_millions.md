The concept of a "company of one" or solopreneurship emphasizes building profitable businesses, often run by a single individual or a very small team, which can generate significant revenue and even lead to substantial wealth [00:02:11]. This approach often prioritizes efficiency, direct problem-solving, and creative execution across all aspects of the business [00:20:17].

A key characteristic of successful solopreneur ventures is identifying and solving a specific, existing problem that people genuinely want addressed, rather than inventing solutions for non-existent issues [00:23:53].

## Examples of Successful Solopreneur Businesses

Here are several examples of businesses that have achieved significant financial success with minimal teams:

### BuiltWith
BuiltWith is a website that identifies the technologies and plugins used to build other websites [00:04:10].
*   **Revenue:** At the time of discussion, it was reportedly doing around $14 million annually [00:04:20].
*   **Founder:** Run by essentially one person in Australia [00:06:05].
*   **Monetization:** It offers various subscription plans (e.g., $3,000/year, $5,000/year, $10,000/year) by providing data on website technologies and contact information of users of specific plugins, allowing for targeted advertising [00:05:01].

### Nomad List & Remote OK
Created by Peter Levels, these platforms are prominent examples of successful single-founder businesses.
*   **Revenue:** Together, they generate around $1 million per year [00:04:26].
*   **Founder:** Peter Levels is a solo founder [00:04:30].
*   **Transparency & Marketing:** Peter Levels is known for openly sharing his revenue data and for employing creative, often rebellious, marketing strategies, such as giving away $10,000 on Twitter to generate viral retweets instead of paying for traditional ads [00:17:37, 00:20:47].
*   **Strategy:** Nomad List thrives by collecting and refining data (e.g., about travel destinations) that would typically be presented in cumbersome "listicles," making it easily accessible and interactive for users [00:39:50].

### Ugmonk
An e-commerce store founded by Jeff Sheldon, Ugmonk began by selling high-quality t-shirts [00:06:18].

*   **Revenue:** The business is estimated to do "several million a year" [00:07:30].

### Carrd
Carrd (carrd.co) is a platform for building simple, responsive one-page websites [00:07:56].

*   **Company:** His company, Play Magnus (playmagnus.com), offers a paid membership ($14/month) [00:46:13, 00:46:15].

It offers advanced features like post-game analysis of blunders, traditionally provided by chess coaches [00:48:41].

### Other Potential Business Opportunities
*   **"Healthiest X" Content Sites:** There is significant search volume for queries like "healthiest cereal" (50,000 searches/month), "healthiest bread" (30,000 searches/month), or "healthiest cheese" (20,000 searches/month) [00:38:43]. This presents an opportunity to create "Wirecutter-style" affiliate websites that compare and recommend healthier options for various foods or restaurant meals, potentially generating thousands of dollars in revenue [00:41:54, 00:42:01, 00:42:06]. The keyword difficulty for these terms is surprisingly low, making it easier to rank [00:43:07]. This is an example of the [[Strategies for Solopreneurs | "your listicle is my opportunity"]] concept [00:39:20].
*   **TikTok Content:** Creating short-form videos on TikTok that address these "healthiest X" questions (e.g., "Craving a chicken sandwich? Don't eat the Popeye's one, eat the Chick-fil-A one, here's why") could quickly gain millions of views and drive traffic to a complementary website [00:41:35]. The MFM Clips TikTok contest, where user-generated clips of podcast content generated 10 million views in under 10 days, demonstrates the viral potential [00:40:50].

These examples showcase that with a lean approach, focus on a clear problem, and strategic use of online platforms, individuals can build highly successful and profitable businesses.

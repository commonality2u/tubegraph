From: [[myfirstmillionpod]] <br/> 

Zuru, a privately held company, generates over two billion US dollars in annual revenue, growing at 25-30% year on year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. It is notably profitable, running at 40% net profits, which is considered unheard of in any product industry globally, including software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. The company has achieved this scale by [[bootstrapping_a_billion_dollar_business | building successful businesses from scratch]] with no outside capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Origin Story and Early Days

The company's origin traces back to a dairy farm in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The founders, brothers Nick and Matt Mowbray, started their entrepreneurial journey by selling kit set hot air balloons door-to-door at festivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This early experience in door-to-door sales taught them valuable lessons about persistence and grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Nick dropped out of law school and, with his brother Matt's suggestion, made the "insane decision" to move to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. They arrived with no money, no plan, no relationships, and no language skills, even sleeping in a bush at Hong Kong airport on their first night due to expensive hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

They started by literally [[building_successful_businesses_from_scratch | building their own factory]] in a small shed on the side of a river in Shantou, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They spent all their money on an injection molding machine and employed a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Living conditions were extremely frugal, sometimes on less than a dollar a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Matt lived in a tiny room at the factory for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Naivety

Their initial products faced significant hurdles:
*   **Regulatory Issues:** Their model hot air balloons couldn't be sold to major toy chains because they didn't meet safety standards, as they had a burning can underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Property (IP) Lawsuits:** They copied other products like a light-up frisbee and a money gobbler bank, unaware of intellectual property or patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This led to lawsuits, and with no money to defend themselves, they had to effectively write their own legal defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Product Quality:** Early products, like their "night balls," were so poorly engineered that they would fall apart on shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. They often sold products once and never received a reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

> [!info] The "McBroke Diet"
> Living on an extremely tight budget, McDonald's was considered a Christmas treat, with a combo costing around $2.50 USD at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Nick would trick staff into giving him extra fries by claiming his half-eaten portion was not full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. They even used children's train passes to save a dollar on fares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Key Breaks and Growth

Despite the early struggles, the brothers maintained a relentless drive, pushing each other forward due to their competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. They had no other option and didn't know about raising capital, so they focused on small wins and continuous fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### The Walmart Break
A significant turning point came with Walmart. Nick relentlessly called Walmart's buyer every day until he got a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. To meet the buyer's requirement for a Hong Kong showroom, Nick rented a tiny glass cubicle, sleeping under a table to save money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Although initial meetings were tough, his persistence eventually led to a $70,000 order for a "night ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### The David Beckham Deal
The real breakthrough came with a David Beckham-licensed soccer Tamagotchi. Despite a $1.5 million licensing fee they couldn't afford, a Walmart buyer, obsessed with David Beckham, placed an order for 2.2 million units, worth almost $30 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This was their largest order to date, far exceeding previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. They partnered with an established manufacturer, Early Light International, to produce the large order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Despite the order being significantly reduced by Walmart and subsequent blacklisting for five years, this deal provided their first significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Expansion

After the initial struggles and first major successes, Zuru adopted a philosophy of extreme frugality and continuous profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. They built their business organically, never borrowing money or going to a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

The company developed a unique model:
*   **First Principles Approach:** They built their company "from first principles," setting up factories differently and automating production, resulting in a highly profitable, self-funded enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.
*   **Speed of Innovation:** In the toy industry, reinventing 40-50% of the product line annually builds a "muscle for speed" in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
*   **"Firing Bullets" Strategy:** Zuru believes in "firing bullets and failing fast." A "bullet" is a minimal viable investment to test an idea. If it works, it becomes a "cannonball," warranting significant investment to build out the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** They instill a mindset of "2% improvement a week," emphasizing compounding gains and a relentless drive to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **"Grit Density":** When hiring, they prioritize "grit smarts and a bias for action," seeking competitive individuals who are "real doers" and don't accept defeat easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

### Expansion into Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Around six years ago, while recovering from surgery, Nick Mowbray recognized an opportunity in the FMCG market, dominated by a few large, less innovative companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. He applied Zuru's model of automation, speed of innovation, and direct-to-consumer marketing to these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

This led to successful ventures in:
*   **Diapers (Rascals and Milly Moon):** They disrupted the market by bringing high-quality Chinese-made diapers at competitive prices, quickly gaining significant market share in New Zealand, Australia, and the US (Walmart's fastest-growing brand in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. They now have a factory with 4 billion diaper capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.
*   **Beauty (Monday Haircare):** Launched during COVID-19, Monday Haircare became a globally recognized shampoo brand, dominating TikTok and achieving significant growth in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. Zuru built its own beauty factory in Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Pet Food (Bonkers):** Their brand Bonkers drove 30% of all cat treat growth in America last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   Other categories under their "five vertical strategy" include supplements (some challenges) and home care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

## Zuru Tech: A Moonshot Idea

Zuru's latest and most ambitious project is Zuru Tech, aiming to revolutionize the construction industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. This self-funded initiative involves:
*   **Dreamcatcher Software:** Built on Unreal Engine, this software allows users, even a 10-year-old, to design custom buildings. It catalogs global building codes, maps terrain, and intelligently designs structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing elements, optimizing for factors like sun orientation and HVAC needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. It also features an AI assistant, Quira, trained on great architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Automated Factory:** The software translates designs into plans for a fully automated factory that builds every single part of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. They have built a 1/10th scale factory, a three-hectare test production line (producing a house every two weeks), and a 25-acre commercial factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. The plan includes a 60-acre factory, comparable to Boeing's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Cost and Quality:** Their goal is to build houses for $500 per square meter with the best quality materials, like aerated concrete and ceramic tile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. This represents an attempt to apply first principles to construction, similar to Elon Musk's "idiot index" approach to rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

Zuru Tech employs around 700 software and hardware engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>. This ambitious project aims to create a fully automated output with a fully customized input, something never done before in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Driving Force

The founders are driven by a love for the game of business, a passion for competing, and a desire to solve bigger problems now that they are in a privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. They believe success is not about how capable you are, but "how willing you are," emphasizing that grit and perseverance are key for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.

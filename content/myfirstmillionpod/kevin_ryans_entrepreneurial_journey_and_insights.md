Kevin Ryan is known for his remarkable [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurial journey]] and a unique approach to venture building, launching numerous successful companies. He violates the typical rule of focusing on one company, instead launching multiple ventures, sometimes eight in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Career and DoubleClick
Kevin Ryan's career began in conventional corporate roles, including at Prudential and Euro Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. He then transitioned to DoubleClick, joining as approximately the 20th employee and later serving as CFO, President, and CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. DoubleClick started in 1996 and grew from 10 people to 2,000 across 25 countries in its first four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Despite the internet collapse where 70% of their clients went bankrupt, they maintained significant market share in ad technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Google eventually acquired DoubleClick for approximately $3 billion in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## AlleyCorp: The Venture Studio Model
After DoubleClick, Kevin Ryan, along with his partner Dwight, founded AlleyCorp, a venture studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Their model involves identifying one to three good ideas per year, finding strong leadership, and providing initial funding of typically $1 million to start each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This initial funding, split between partners, provides about six months to assess viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. More recently, initial investments have increased to around $1.5 million per company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

AlleyCorp has demonstrated how a studio model can be successful, a feat many others have struggled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Key to their success is deep market research, with team members often spending two and a half months interviewing 50 people for a single idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. They then commit to the idea and recruit a strong team, which is critical for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. Ryan emphasizes that the business is simple in concept ("good idea and good team") but hard to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:12]</a>.

It has secured patents for compounds like Methalalone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy and Strategy

### Growth and Investment
Ryan's philosophy centers on aggressive growth once an idea is validated. He states, "If you're not hiring fast enough and losing money AKA investing, you either haven't figured it out or you don't believe that your idea is good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The analogy he uses is building a "machine that turns one dollar into two dollars," implying that if such a machine exists, one should "back that truck up into that machine and dump it in there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. This aggressive investment is predicated on the idea that the market is large enough and the product is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. However, he also emphasizes the importance of cutting back if returns aren't met, having cut 30% of staff in some companies when the market or product wasn't working as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Raising Capital
When considering raising capital, Ryan advises evaluating if the investment will increase the company's value by more than the dilution incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. He cautions against raising too much capital in early rounds if the company is projected to be worth significantly more later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Speed and Risk
A core tenet is the urgency of speed: "Time is never on your side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. He believes that good ideas will inevitably be replicated, so moving quickly is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. People often "understate the risk of not doing something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. DoubleClick's expansion to 25 countries before its first country was profitable exemplified this; it secured market dominance by being global first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

### Problem Identification and Long-Term Trends
Ryan focuses on identifying "big obvious problem[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a> that are not too complicated or nuanced to understand. He's always thinking about "where the world is going to be in 10 years," betting on long-term trends rather than short-term fads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

### Team Building and Role as Chairman
Ryan views himself as the "coach," not the "player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>. He focuses on recruiting talented CEOs and building strong internal infrastructure, including an in-house engineering team of 70 and an executive search firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. As chairman of 12 companies, he spends about half his time guiding the most valuable ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. His role involves ensuring the company is guided, finding CEOs if needed, and managing tricky financing rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>.

### Industry Focus
AlleyCorp maintains an industry-focused approach, with specialized teams researching specific sectors. Current areas of interest include:
*   Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>
*   Semiconductors and Material Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>
*   Developer Tools and Enterprise Software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>
*   B2B Marketplaces (e.g., maritime industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>
*   Social Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>
*   Robotics and Automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a> (betting on rising labor costs and falling tech costs leading to more automation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>

### View on AI
While not directly investing in AI companies due to high valuations, Ryan strongly encourages all his portfolio companies to integrate AI to optimize operations like customer support and coding efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:00">[43:41:00]</a>. He facilitated a week-long shutdown for his technology investment team to immerse themselves in learning about AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a>.

## Case Studies of Success

### Business Insider
In 2007, the insight for Business Insider was simple: traditional business publications like the Wall Street Journal and Business Week were not updating their websites throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. With the rise of mobile phones, there was an obvious need for continuous updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Business Insider differentiated itself by:
*   **Continuous Updates**: Publishing multiple stories daily as information became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Opinionated Content**: Prioritizing a smart point of view over being perfectly right in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   **SEO and A/B Testing**: Obsessing over headlines and search results, A/B testing three headlines very quickly for each story to see what resonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Growth over Initial "Quality"**: Critics initially dismissed Business Insider as "low quality" or "junk," comparing it to Honda's early entry into the American car market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. However, the strategy focused on traffic and market share, which eventually surpassed established players like the Wall Street Journal in traffic within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. It achieved 300 million unique visitors without spending any money on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Henry Blodget, despite past controversies on Wall Street, was chosen as CEO for his incredible writing, perceptive journalism, and deep understanding of internet journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### MongoDB
Started in 2007 with Dwight and brilliant engineer Elliot Horowitz, MongoDB was born from the insight that Oracle's database was not suitable for the future of unstructured data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. With the rise of platforms like YouTube and video content, a new open-source, flexible database was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>.

The journey was difficult; for three years, the company had zero revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. Despite this, the internal team saw growing product utilization and a large user base of small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. They focused on making the product good enough for larger companies to pay for it, eventually raising significant funding from Sequoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

### Gilt
Gilt was started because Kevin Ryan saw a market gap: in 2007, it was impossible to buy luxury fashion from designers like Marc Jacobs at 50% off online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>. By offering this, Gilt generated immense customer enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:00">[33:46:00]</a>.

## Personal Investment Strategy
Kevin Ryan keeps about 90% of his net worth invested in his own firm and its ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>. He holds some investments in other VC and private equity firms as an LP, and some real estate, but no public equities or traditional bonds, other than holding a lot of cash for liquidity as he does not draw a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>. He is currently developing a new AlleyCorp headquarters building in New York City with commercial space, a restaurant, and event areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:00">[57:17:00]</a>.

## Lifestyle and Outlook
Ryan values intellectual curiosity and enjoys the variety of learning about different industries through his portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>. He maintains a low public profile, avoiding social media, as he prefers to use his time for thinking and managing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:45:00">[48:45:00]</a>. He also enjoys spending three to four months a year working from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:00">[53:43:00]</a>. His approach is characterized by emotional stability, enabling him to make rational decisions even in high-stakes situations, such as negotiating the sale of Business Insider where he pushed for a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:21:00">[55:21:00]</a>.

The rise of digital assets and [[the_rise_and_challenges_of_Web3_and_crypto | Web3]] technologies, particularly Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and social tokens, is profoundly reshaping the future of music and culture. This shift enables new forms of investment, community building, and direct relationships between creators and consumers.

## NFTs and Scarcity in the Digital World
In the digital world, anything that gets digitized typically trends towards zero in value or cost over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. The breakthrough of [[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] is their ability to introduce scarcity to a digital asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. This means that previously worthless digital content can now be assigned a one-of-one value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. While the concept could have originated from various industries, it notably gained prominence in the art market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

## Community and Identity through Digital Assets
[[impact_of_smart_contracts_and_nfts | NFTs]] allow for the identification of a community where like-minded individuals can coalesce around an idea, such as a piece of art or a specific project like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Owning an NFT serves as a membership to a club and acts as an identifier, akin to displaying a Rolex or other tribal markers that humans constantly use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

The internet, by connecting people globally, created a "big shouting room" that can be exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Digital communities, enabled by [[the_value_and_future_use_cases_of_nfts | NFTs]] and social tokens, offer a solution by providing "sovereign states, villages, towns, cities" online where individuals with shared values can interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. These tokens act as identifiers, with social tokens being a significant emerging trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. Ultimately, [[the_value_and_future_use_cases_of_nfts | NFTs]] are expected to also serve as a person's digital identity online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Culture as Investment: Music, Fashion, and Sports
The most vibrant communities globally revolve around sports and culture, encompassing fashion brands, music, and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. The key innovation in this space is the ability to tokenize communities, aligning the network owner with the network user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This means that a pop star and their token holders are now part of the same network, incentivizing everyone to grow its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

This shift transforms culture into an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Historically, consumers could buy a cultural marker like an Adidas sneaker, but they didn't directly profit from its growth or connect with a network of other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Now, individuals can become part of and invest in music or fashion networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. For example, a 16-year-old can invest in a rising pop star by buying their social tokens or song IP via [[the_value_and_future_use_cases_of_nfts | NFTs]], potentially earning a return by using their "human instincts about the communities they want to be part of and which networks are going to thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

### Impact on the Music Industry
[[independent_music_production_and_marketing_strategies | Music]] is particularly powerful due to its connection to human emotion and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. The ability for musicians to sell directly to and maintain a direct relationship with their fans via social tokens and [[the_value_and_future_use_cases_of_nfts | NFTs]] is a "game changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

Traditionally, record labels and other middlemen extract about 80% of the economics from music sales, forcing artists to rely heavily on extensive and exhausting tours to earn significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Artists also had to create artificial scarcity (e.g., concert tickets) and status (e.g., concert photos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Under the new model, artists can leverage their token holders to de-risk tours by selling a large portion of tickets in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

This system encourages fans to become active marketers:
> "Because that 16 year old kid because he's now financially incentivized to grow the network and make that song a success it doesn't make sense like 100 tick tock videos yeah exactly right and if you multiply that by all of the token holders of those ip rights they're all marketing free for you because they get paid in the upside it's genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>

This dynamic transforms every believer into a marketer for the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. It's a form of universal basic equity where cultural instincts become investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

Natural language processing (NLP) is emerging as a significant mega-trend, potentially even larger than mobile technology in its impact on software usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. The core idea behind this trend is to make software truly intuitive by allowing users to express their intent in natural language, rather than learning complex commands or interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

## The Vision for Intuitive Software

Historically, software companies have claimed their products are intuitive and easy to use, but the reality is that users must translate their intent into a series of clicks, drags, and swipes to make the software perform the desired action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. The future envisions a world where users can simply state what they want to achieve, and the software understands and executes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

For instance, in a program like Photoshop, a user could simply say, "remove the background," instead of navigating menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. In a business context, such as within Hubspot, a user could ask, "how many new people signed up for our service hub product in the last 90 days?" without needing to build a report manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This shift is possible due to advancements in natural language understanding, requiring primarily a translation layer between human intent and software action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

This development could enable billions of people to use software that was previously inaccessible due to the learning curve of clicks and drags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. The business-to-business (B2B) software sector, particularly in areas like business intelligence and reporting, is considered ripe for this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. While consumer-facing applications like Alexa have shown early hints of this, the B2B world is poised for a significant leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

## Current Applications and "Magic Tricks"

The concept of a "magic trick" in software refers to an experience so seamless and effective that it's hard to unsee, rendering older software obsolete by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

Examples of such magic tricks in natural language processing include:

*   **GrowthBot**: A tool built for marketers to extract marketing data and answer questions from various sources via natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. It allowed users to ask questions like "what are the top three keywords that Uber buys on PPC?" or "when was this domain registered?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Though a bit early at its launch, it demonstrated the potential for intuitive querying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **D-Build and GPT-3**: An example involving GPT-3 where a user could describe a website they wanted, such as one with two columns, pictures of places to stay on the left, and prices on the right, and the system would generate the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. This showcased the ability to "code without having to code" by simply describing the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. The ability to request actions like adding a PayPal button that only takes a maximum of five dollars and directs payments to a specific address, then seeing the HTML and CSS generated, was considered a "magic trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **[[Generative AI and its potential impact | GPT-3]]**: This technology is described as the "closest thing to magic" due to its text generation capabilities based on a vast corpus of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. While practical use cases were still developing, it was recognized as a technology that would go "from a zero to a one very very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. It embodies the "slowly then all of a sudden" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

## The Power of Natural Language

This new paradigm is seen as a "next level Google" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. Instead of receiving a list of pages that might contain the answer, users would ask a question and directly receive the answer from the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This shift suggests a fundamental change in how users interact with technology, moving towards more direct and conversational interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It points to a future where [[the_future_of_software_and_aidriven_businesses | software is driven by AI]] to be truly intuitive.

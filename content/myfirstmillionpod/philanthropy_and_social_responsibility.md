Neil Patel's approach to wealth, business, and philanthropy is characterized by a strong focus on social responsibility and effective giving, often prioritizing immediate impact and the well-being of others over personal accumulation or public recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. He believes money is a tool to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

## Philosophy on Wealth and Spending

Patel's financial philosophy has evolved over time. Ten years ago, he stated that $15,000 a month was all he needed to be happy, particularly when single with no kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Currently, his estimated monthly burn rate is between $120,000 and $180,000, even without a mortgage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. A significant portion of this goes to property tax and HOA dues (around $200,000 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, and a substantial whole life insurance policy costing $25,000 a month, which functions as an investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

Despite a high burn rate, he emphasizes that his daily life does not involve extravagant spending, often wearing simple clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He has experimented with luxury expenses, such as spending hundreds of thousands on clothes and flying first class, partly to justify these expenses as "experiments" for his blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. However, he prefers to optimize for convenience, such as having a full-time driver ($57,000 a month, which includes the cost of special parking privileges for a limo company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>, and flying private planes to maximize time with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. These personal expenses are not expensed to his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

Patel's wealth comes from profitable businesses and successful investments in the stock market (focused on tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Hubspot, Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian, Shopify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>, and angel investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. He also uses cash to acquire other companies at low multiples (e.g., 3-5x EBITDA) to fix, grow, and cash flow, leveraging his ability to secure cheap debt at low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

Patel states that he and his wife are "not rich" and don't spend as much as their income might suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, preferring not to discuss their personal finances openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

## Approach to Business and Social Impact

### Leveraging Minority Status
Patel's agency, NP Digital, benefits from his status as a minority-owned business in the United States, as some Fortune 500 companies have quotas for engaging with diverse businesses (e.g., LGBTQ+, veteran-owned, minority-owned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. He found it surprising to be considered a minority given India's large population but obtained the necessary certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This status, combined with merit (awards, case studies, competitive pricing), has helped his agency win deals, akin to what has been described as the "Magic Johnson formula" in the minority business space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Giving Away Businesses for Impact
An example of Patel's unique approach to wealth and [[The interplay between money success and personal values | personal values]] is his decision to give the monthly distributions from his company, Crazy Egg, to his co-founder, Hiten Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. He did this because he felt he didn't need the money, and it allowed him to focus on creating other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Philanthropic Strategy

Patel and his wife actively engage in philanthropy, considering it "investing in people" rather than mere donations, even though they don't expect financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

### Guiding Principles for Giving
Their giving is guided by specific rules:
- **Low Overhead**: They avoid donating to organizations with high overheads, preferring their money to directly reach the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
- **Self-Sufficiency**: They prioritize organizations and programs that are designed to be self-sufficient and sustainable, ensuring long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
- **Efficiency of Time vs. Money**: Neil believes it's more efficient for him to focus on making money, which can then be donated for a larger impact, rather than volunteering his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. His wife, however, enjoys volunteering her time and vetting non-profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Focus Areas: Education and Health
They focus their efforts on tangible impacts, such as:
- **Education**: Supporting women's education in villages in India and parts of Africa. They found that women were more likely than men to return to their communities and teach others after receiving an education, fulfilling the program's promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. They have funded schools in places like Cambodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.
- **Health**: Implementing programs like "growing gardens" for individuals with AIDS in Africa. These gardens provide nutritious food, which helps their bodies better absorb medication given for free, and also feeds others in the village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

### Long-term vs. Immediate Impact
They prioritize seeing an impact within one to two years, rather than waiting decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. For example, they choose to focus on basic needs like education where they can make a significant difference, rather than complex, large-scale issues like cancer research where their financial contribution would be comparatively small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Personal Motivation and Transparency

Patel's primary motivation is not to become a billionaire, as they donate a significant portion of their money annually, rather than waiting until after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. He ensures his house staff and nannies are "drastically overpaid" with six-figure salaries, believing it's important to take care of those who need it more, especially since he doesn't plan to give his own children large inheritances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. His goal for his children is for them to be productive, ambitious, and caring members of society, prioritizing character traits and skills over financial inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

Patel's open discussion about his finances and philanthropic choices, though initially making him uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>, helps expand the [[The importance of transparency and intent in relationships and wealth management | worldview]] of others on what is possible and normal in terms of wealth management and giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

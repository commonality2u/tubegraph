MrBeast, also known as Jimmy, describes his work ethic as an intense cycle of obsession and burnout, aiming to produce the "greatest YouTube videos possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.

## Core Work Philosophy

MrBeast's approach involves waking up and obsessing over a project, continuing intensely until a mental breakdown or burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He then takes a day or a day and a half off before immediately returning to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He doesn't adhere to a set work schedule but rather pushes himself to the limit until he "crashes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This intense method, though seemingly unsustainable, has proven effective for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.

He attributes his success to the immense effort put into content creation, stating that his team spends significantly longer thinking of ideas (20-30 times longer), filming (10 times more), and budgeting for videos (100 times more) compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

## Daily Routine and Habits

*   **Sleep Schedule**: He typically goes to sleep around 3 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Waking Up**: His team, such as Rohan or Tariq, often wakes him up to review videos for submission, help with thumbnails, or to film new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. He states, "I don't know, I'm kind of, I they tell me what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Office Environment**: His personal office space features a gaming chair and computer, alongside a bench press, an algae and water bottle, and walls adorned with quotes from figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. He admits to strategically placing fake Elon Musk quotes among real ones to test if people believe them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## Perfectionism and Content Strategy

MrBeast is a perfectionist regarding his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He only uploads videos he considers "great," sometimes going two months without uploading if a video doesn't meet his standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. He believes it is "dumb" for creators to stick to a strict upload schedule if the content isn't high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. His goal is simply to make the "greatest YouTube videos possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.

## Managerial Style

MrBeast's company is described as not being run like a "normal company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. An employee notes that the "extreme good part" of working with him is the unique experiences, including travel and executing cool stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The "worst part" is the lack of routine and not knowing what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, which is something employees learn to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

For his other ventures, like his snack brand and Beast Burger, he establishes them as separate entities, hiring industry experts to build and lead independent teams, such as Jim from RX Bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. His approach is to "find people who are just the best in the goddamn world at their job and then just empower them and give them money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Currently, his studio employs about 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Inspiration and Learning

MrBeast admires figures like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. He finds inspiration in Steve Jobs's ability to build a billion-dollar company like Pixar, separate from Apple, and then return to Apple to revitalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This highlights for him "the power of having good vision and just not relenting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

His biggest strength is his curiosity and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He believes in constantly absorbing new information and inspiration from diverse sources like podcasts and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He even pays people to teach him new things and present him with cool concepts he might not be aware of, like complex online puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This constant intake of knowledge helps him generate original ideas that differentiate his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

MrBeast contrasts his content strategy with those who use divisiveness to "rev the algorithm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Instead, he focuses on creating content that evokes "joy and spectacle and wonder," which he finds more enjoyable, despite it being harder to achieve viral attention than simply agitating people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Early Obsession and Persistence

Starting YouTube at age 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, MrBeast quickly became engrossed in content creation. He would often skip studying in high school, throwing his books under the bleachers to film videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. He famously created "messages to himself" in the form of scheduled YouTube uploads years into the future, setting ambitious subscriber goals and envisioning a full-time YouTube career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. These videos showcased his unwavering belief in his path, even when earning only "10 bucks a month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

He highlights a quote from [[Conor McGregors mindset and career trajectory | Conor McGregor]] about being "obsessed with my game" and having "lost my mind to it" with no time for anything else, a sentiment MrBeast strongly resonates with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

He made the decision early on to be a YouTuber and "make great videos," irrespective of whether he became the "most famous Youtuber of all time or 90 years old with a thousand subscribers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This strong conviction was solidified when he learned a Call of Duty YouTuber's leaked earnings showed they made over $100,000 a year, which deeply motivated him to pursue YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

He notes the societal shift in perception regarding obsession; while he was once labeled a "loser nerd" for his dedication, it's now seen as inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He advises younger people and parents to allow children to follow their obsessions, as it leads to a unique path that is hard to copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. He cautions against "hedging," where people half-heartedly pursue their passions while also seeking a more "proven or shiny" path, stating that this "hedge is actually what gets you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

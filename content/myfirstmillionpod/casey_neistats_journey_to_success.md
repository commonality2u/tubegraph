Casey Neistat emphasizes his passion for discussing "the hustle," a topic he rarely gets to explore in public speaking engagements focusing on media, social media, technology, or film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He recounts his life and career, specifically highlighting the role of hustle in his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Early Life and the Genesis of Hustle

Neistat believes he truly understood the concept of hustle only when he found something worth striving for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### High School and Dropping Out
In high school, his stated goal was to maintain a D+ C-minus average, the bare minimum required for graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He did not achieve even that, dropping out at 15 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This decision was not glorified; at the time, he had run away from home, his girlfriend was pregnant, and they were living in a trailer park, making finishing school impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### The "Arrested Development" Phase
Between the ages of 16 and 20, Neistat spent 45 to 60 hours a week working as a dishwasher in a restaurant, a job he "hated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He refers to this period as a "phase of Arrested Development," where despite future success or happiness, he would always identify with that struggling kid living in a trailer park with a baby, barely making ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

However, it was during this time that he first experienced the direct correlation between effort and reward. As a dishwasher, he became the best the restaurant ever had, developing a system no one could beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This hustle led to two promotions, eventually becoming a line cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This "rudimentary, very fundamental understanding" of hustle – putting a lot in to get more out – was a lesson he never let go of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Moving to New York City and Breakthroughs

### Initial Struggles in NYC
Neistat moved to New York City with only $800 to his name, no high school diploma, and limited work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. His living situation was "miserable": he slept on an upright futon in a tiny bedroom, shared a hallway bathroom with diverse neighbors, and worked as a bike messenger, a job that cost him money due to cell phone minute charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Working for Tom Sachs
His first "real job" in New York was for artist Tom Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Neistat started by collecting police barriers for Sachs, earning $10 per barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Sachs then hired him for $10 an hour to cut cardboard squares in a warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Neistat observed the "magic of New York City," where people "doing everything they could to chase down what it was they wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He felt this drive for the first time while working for Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

He began secretly filming videos in Sachs' office after work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. When Sachs accidentally saw them, he was impressed and hired Neistat to make videos full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### The Bill Clinton Birthday Video
This opportunity led to an art collector asking Neistat and his brother Van to create a birthday video for her husband, Fred Hochberg, who was a significant figure in the Clinton and Obama Administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:00]</a>. The list of people to interview included former President Bill Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Neistat humorously recounts disrupting the teleprompter during the interview with Clinton and getting the President to deliver a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This video was well-received and generated further interest in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### "Science Experiments" and Art World Recognition
The same art collector bankrolled their next project, a series of short videos called "Science Experiments." They used "Mr. Wizard's World's book of experiments" as their script and filmed in Neistat's apartment bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The videos were shown at Miami Art Basel and led to an invitation to exhibit at the São Paulo Biennial, a major art show in Brazil, an immense honor for Neistat, who was about 23 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Despite being recognized as "fine artists" and celebrated at international events, the underlying struggle of "the hustle" remained constant. One week he was celebrated in São Paulo, the next he was sleeping in the attic of his dad's coffee shop with his baby, trying to afford the $110 train ticket to Connecticut to see his son Owen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Philosophy of Hustle and the "Biggest Failure"

Neistat, at 36, shares key truths he has learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. He asserts that "the beauty of hustle, the beauty of work is it will truly like never let you down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. His "guaranteed recipe for success" is to dedicate one's entire life to something; either you achieve it, or you die trying, both of which demonstrate focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. He cites the documentary "Anvil! The Story of Anvil" as a prime example of relentless commitment, where a band's unwavering pursuit of their dream, despite years of obscurity, ultimately led to global recognition through a film about their persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### HBO Show and the Pitfall of Success
In 2006, an entrepreneur and mentor named Tom Scott offered Neistat and his brother a significant opportunity that eventually manifested as an HBO show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. The show was sold to HBO for over $2 million when Neistat was 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. He felt he had "made it," with Variety covering the news and his hometown newspaper writing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

However, he considers "celebrating success" as his "biggest failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. After selling the show in 2008, he "took a big step back," assuming he had achieved everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This period (2008-2010) was the "most depressing time" of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Despite winning an Independent Spirit Award for a feature film he produced and having his HBO show premiere, he was "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. He realized he had lost touch with his passion and the essence of the hustle by "basking in the sunlight" of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This experience taught him that "with every success should come a bigger, more ambitious goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

## Re-engaging the Hustle: YouTube and Beyond

### The YouTube Revival
Following this period of unhappiness, Neistat "went back to the drawing board" and decided to focus on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. He viewed YouTube as the "most pure form of hustle," allowing him to share ideas through video without the politics of traditional media or the pursuit of awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. It was about "busting my ass for the craft where nobody was watching, nobody was paying attention, nobody was making me do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

Within three years, he accumulated 150 million views, building a career purely on hustle, independent of his prior achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### MIT Fellowship and Tech Entrepreneurship
Around 2013, Neistat was invited to a fellowship at MIT, a joint program sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, MIT Media Lab, and the Sundance Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. For a high school dropout, attending MIT was a significant personal milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This opportunity forced him to take a "gigantic risk": shutting down his company, leaving his new and pregnant wife, and moving to Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This was a major crossroads that made him reset and reaffirm his willingness to chase what excited him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

At MIT, he gained a new understanding of technology, which led him to start a tech company called Beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Beam was a significant departure as it had no relationship to his media career; it was purely about technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

### The Beam Company Journey and CNN Acquisition
Beam raised several million dollars and initially saw success by leveraging Neistat's social media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. However, a year and a half in, they were nearly out of money and not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Instead of cutting staff, Neistat decided to take the entire team on a vacation to the Dominican Republic, a decision supported by his lead investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This seemingly "crazy and stupid" idea led to the realization that their most valuable asset was their strong, cohesive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This renewed enthusiasm and re-evaluation of their company's value ultimately led to the sale of Beam to CNN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Current Outlook and Family Life

Now, with tremendous resources and an unbelievable team at CNN, Neistat faces a new "mountain" to climb, figuring out how to build a successful company under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. He confidently states that the number one most important ingredient in making it happen is "the hustle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

### Family as a Driver
When asked how he manages everything with a family, Neistat explains that having a child from a young age has always been his driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. He attributes his ability to do what he does to having "somebody else to do all of this for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Time Management and Priorities
Pragmatically, he manages his time by strictly scheduling his work around his family: leaving for work after his daughter Francine goes to school (10 AM), being home before 6 PM, and working from 8 PM until midnight and again from 4 AM until 7 AM when she wakes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. He achieves this demanding schedule by prioritizing work and family above social life, stating he doesn't party, drink, or socialize much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. He typically functions on 3 to 5 hours of sleep for several days, then catches up with an 8-hour sleep session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

### Most Proud Content
Neistat is most proud of any content involving his family, as it creates a "portrait of my life" he can always look back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. He specifically recommends "A Love Story" about how he and Candace got married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

In closing, Neistat reiterates that "so few people are actually willing to do it [the hustle]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. He advises that every time someone drops off, takes the safe route, or makes a compromise because it's less risky, "that's just one less person that you'll have to climb over on your way to the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

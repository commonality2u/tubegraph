Decentralized production, particularly in the context of The Production Board (TPB), focuses on transforming global production systems to reduce environmental impact while simultaneously enhancing consumer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach challenges traditional models of manufacturing by bringing production closer to the consumer.

## Philosophy of Decentralized Production

TPB's core mission is to [[sustainability_through_technologydriven_solutions | change systems of production]] on Earth to enable manufacturing with less energy, land, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. The belief is that sustainability in the 21st century comes from building technology-based solutions that allow consumers to consume more, while simultaneously lowering prices and environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.

This philosophy contrasts with the industrial revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries, where large factories were built to automate production, dropping prices for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, technology, like that used in factories, consistently shrinks, becomes faster, cheaper, and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>. This ongoing technological advancement enables the decentralization of manufacturing, bringing the capability of a factory directly into homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

## Environmental Impact of Centralized Beverage Production

The traditional beverage industry, relying on centralized manufacturing, has a significant environmental footprint:
*   **Water Usage**: Producing a single liter of wine requires approximately 600 liters of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>, while a liter of orange juice requires about 40 liters of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>. Globally, around 400 trillion liters of water are used in the entire production cycle of bottled beverages annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **Carbon Emissions**: Approximately half a billion tons of CO2 are released into the atmosphere each year to produce bottled and canned beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. This accounts for the energy used in growing crops, manufacturing packaging (glass, plastic, cans), and transportation via trucks to warehouses, stores, and homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   **Land Use**: Around 120 million acres of farmland could be returned to natural ecosystems if current production methods were reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.
*   **Archaic System**: The current system, costing consumers $2.3 trillion annually, involves moving massive amounts of water in packaged containers to homes that already have piped water access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

## Cana.com: A Decentralized Solution

Cana.com, a molecular beverage printer, exemplifies TPB's approach to decentralized production by addressing the environmental inefficiencies of the traditional beverage industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>.

### Core Concept
The fundamental discovery behind Cana is that 99% of beverages consist of water (or water plus sugar/alcohol), while only 1% comprises the chemistry responsible for flavor, smell, color, and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. For example, wine, despite having about 500 flavor compounds, only relies on 30 to 40 compounds for sensory perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. This principle applies across various beverages like coffee, tea, juice, soda, liquor, and beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

Cana aims to deliver these concentrated flavor compounds in cartridges, similar to an inkjet printer, enabling users to create any beverage by combining them with water already available in their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. The device offers optional chilling and carbonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

### Environmental Benefits
By decentralizing beverage production to the household level, Cana directly reduces:
*   **Water Waste**: It eliminates the need to transport water that is already available in homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Packaging Waste**: It significantly reduces the need for glass, plastic, and can production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.
*   **Transportation Emissions**: It bypasses the carbon-intensive logistics of trucking beverages from factories to warehouses, then to stores, and finally to homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Refrigeration Energy**: It reduces the need for large-scale refrigeration and storage in homes and stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

The long-term incentive is to remove carbon from the atmosphere, reduce water waste, and return farmland to natural ecosystems, all while providing a cheaper and better experience for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

> "Most people would look at that environmental supply chain... and say how do we make this 20% more efficient at this step, how do we make the trucks emit a little less carbon dioxide... and what you've done is said why are we doing this in the first place, why don't we eliminate the whole chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>

Cana's approach is not just about incremental improvements to existing processes, but a fundamental shift in how beverages are produced and consumed, aiming for a significant positive environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

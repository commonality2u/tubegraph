Christina, the founder of Vanta, achieved significant success with her company valued at $2.45 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. However, her [[entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned | path to success]] was not linear, marked by numerous challenges and projects that initially "went nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Her story highlights the importance of not "counting yourself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> and learning from iterative failures to eventually find success.

## Taking the Leap: From USV to Self-Employment

Christina initially held a "good job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> at USV, a venture capital firm, which she describes as having "hustled her way into" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> through simply sending links to her web presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Despite being advised to specialize in crypto and become a crypto VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, she felt a strong desire to "go make things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

Her decision to leave USV at the end of 2012 was met with significant angst and skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Many questioned why she would leave a desirable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, with one person emphasizing that the "right side" of her email address (usv.com) was more powerful than the "left side" (Christina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, implying she was betting on herself against long odds. Her plan was not immediately to start a startup, but to "teach herself to code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> and make products by living off her bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## The "Bad Art" Era and Iterative Learning

Christina's initial two years were dedicated to learning to code and building numerous projects, none of which gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. She created 35 projects that "mostly went nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### Embracing "Bad Art"
A core philosophy Christina and her team adopted was the concept of "bad art," derived from the book "The Art of Fear."
> "The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>

This quote suggests that early creative projects, or "bad art," serve as learning experiences for future successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Christina explains that many successful founders didn't achieve immediate success; rather, they "try a bunch of stuff and eventually something might work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>, often being their "thing five" or even "thing 55" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

### Practical Application of Iteration
To maintain structure and discipline during her self-learning phase, Christina "tricked herself into acting like [she] had a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, going to a friend's office space every day and dressing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

She illustrates the value of iterative failure with two analogies:
*   **The Pottery Class:** An art teacher assigns students to either make one perfect pot or as many pots as possible. The student who makes 300 pots, despite early failures, ultimately produces the best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. This emphasizes learning by doing and quantity over initial perfection.
*   **The Marshmallow Test (Marshmallow Challenge):** Teams are given spaghetti sticks, tape, and a marshmallow to build the tallest tower. Adults often over-plan, leading to collapse when the marshmallow is added at the end. Children, however, immediately test the marshmallow's weight, learning faster through early failures and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of "testing the riskiest assumption" early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.

Christina's initial projects, such as a book website, were driven by personal interest rather than commercial viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, serving as a means to practice coding and learn new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

## From Personal Problem to Market Need: The Genesis of Vanta

After two years of self-teaching, Christina realized the limitations of building only for herself. She transitioned to Dropbox for a "real job" to gain experience working in a company and with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. This move came from a point of frustration and uncertainty about her employability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

Her experience at Dropbox, particularly with product security, sparked the idea for Vanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>. While working on Dropbox Paper, she encountered the challenge of SOC 2 compliance preventing its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. This "annoying" process that took two years at Dropbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>, became her insight: "if it blocked us maybe it blocks other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. She recognized a market gap for security solutions tailored to startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

Instead of immediately coding, she chose to validate the idea using "an Excel spreadsheet only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>, asking YC startups if they would find value in such a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>. This "how do I find reality faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a> approach allowed her to frontload validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>.

## [[Lessons from entrepreneurship | Lessons Learned]] and Sustaining the Journey

### Validating Ideas: The "Mom Test"
To avoid false positives when seeking feedback, Christina adopted a strict rule: "anything that is not can you do this for me now tomorrow next week is a no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. She advises asking about customers' problems first, rather than pitching solutions, and to always follow up and make it easy for them to connect you to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

### Early Hustle and Growth
Vanta's early growth involved diverse strategies:
*   **Cold Outbound:** Christina sent numerous emails to YC companies, initially seeking "feedback" but often leading to product interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.
*   **Word-of-Mouth:** They intentionally cultivated word-of-mouth by building "call-response" within founder and VC slack channels, aiming to create a strong brand association between SOC 2 and Vanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.
*   **Podcast Advertising:** Surprisingly effective, podcast advertising proved to be a valuable early growth channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

### [[Overcoming personal and career setbacks | Managing Self-Doubt]] and Psychology
Christina developed methods to [[overcoming entrepreneurial challenges | manage her own mind]] and [[overcoming adversity and finding mentorship | psychology]]. To counter self-doubt during unproductive periods, she used a personal Google Form survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. The key question was: "what would make you stop working on what you're working on right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>. This helped her identify when stubbornness was overriding objective evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>.

She emphasizes the importance of knowing what makes you "feel like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a> – what brings out your "best shinest version of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a> – and not giving those things up, no matter how busy you get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. For her, this includes running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a> and reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>, even taking a bus to work to ensure uninterrupted reading time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

Christina also champions the idea that "progress equals happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. She views "moving the goal posts" as a positive:
> "If you don't feel a sense of progress in your life you will feel unhappy and then you'll feel even worse you'll feel guilty for feeling unhappy because you're like I guess I do have all these good things in my life but I still don't feel this way I'm just fundamentally broken inside I'll never be happy when actuality it's just a sense of progress even better a sense of progress in a direction that you have set out intentionally that you care about." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>

This mindset allows for continuous pursuit of growth and enjoyment of the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>.

### High Standards and Pushing Boundaries
Christina believes in setting "high standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a> within her company, creating an environment where people are "into what they do, getting better every day, care a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. She relates this to the "reality distortion field" of figures like Mr. Beast, who instinctively push past the initial "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>, believing that "why not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a> is the default assumption.

## Fundraising and Confidence
Vanta raised its Series A late, at $10 million in ARR, intentionally keeping their progress low-key to avoid competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. This strategy led to surprising reactions from VCs who underestimated their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. Christina attributes her negotiation strength to confidence: "if I'm confident I'm actually confident in it and then will just stand and like not blink not swerve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>. This unwavering conviction, especially when discussing something she deeply believes in, makes fundraising an enjoyable experience despite her general dislike for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a>.

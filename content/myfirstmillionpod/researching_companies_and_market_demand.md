Sam, the speaker, outlines a systematic research methodology for [[developing_unique_business_ideas | developing business ideas]] and identifying market opportunities, a process he used to create successful ventures like The Hustle and Hampton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. This approach involves looking for specific "hooks" or insights from various data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Sam's Research Methodology for Business Ideas

Sam's research model focuses on identifying five or six key elements, likening it to writing a song where a single riff or lyric can form the core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>:

1.  **Demand**: Identifying existing problems people have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Audience Size**: Determining how many people share that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Leaders in the Space**: Analyzing what companies are succeeding and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
4.  **Shortcomings**: Pinpointing the deficiencies or unmet needs left by existing leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
5.  **Effective Business Models**: Understanding which business models are most profitable or scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
6.  **Unsolved Problems**: Discovering problems that are currently not being addressed in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Key Research Hooks and Insights

Sam emphasizes looking for "one or two lines" or "tidbits" that catch his attention from large companies or data, as these often signal significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### Demand and Audience Size

*   **Example: 1800 Flowers**
    *   By analyzing traffic data (e.g., using SimilarWeb), Sam observed 1800 Flowers received millions of monthly visitors, peaking significantly in February (Valentine's Day) and May/June (Mother's Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This indicated strong existing demand and a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Leaders and Shortcomings

*   **Example: 1800 Flowers**
    *   Sam reads public companies' annual reports to find insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   From an 1800 Flowers annual report, he learned that succulent plants were the fastest-growing trend among millennial consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
    *   The report also revealed shortcomings: most revenue came from holidays, and they sought to generate more business between holidays and sell more accessories like vases, which had higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
    *   This led to [[startup_ideas_and_opportunities | startup ideas]] focused on regular plant subscriptions or unique vase designs, some of which went on to raise millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Heineken**
    *   Heineken's annual report indicated that "Heineken Zero" (non-alcoholic version) was their fastest-growing segment, even if still small, pointing to an [[expanding_into_new_markets_and_industries | emerging market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. When large companies identify something as "fast growing," it piques Sam's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Effective Business Models

*   **Example: VPN Review Site**
    *   Sam discovered a UK-based company reviewing VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) with 12 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. By checking their financials on Company House, he found they had £18 million in revenue and £16 million in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
    *   This showed significant demand for [[security_startups_and_market_insights | VPN reviews]] and highlighted the profitability of an affiliate marketing business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This insight then sparked ideas for applying similar affiliate models to other tech products like payroll software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This is an example of [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | various business models]].

## Tools and Resources

Sam relies on several tools to conduct his market research:

*   **SimilarWeb**: A browser plugin (free version available) that provides traffic estimates for websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He uses it constantly to quickly assess a website's traffic volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **AnnualReports.com**: A resource for finding public companies' quarterly and annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These reports, while often perceived as boring, are invaluable for finding specific insights about a company's performance, strategies, and emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Company House (UK)**: A UK government service where companies with over £10 million in revenue must file their financials publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Sam specifically looks for companies with "LTD" (Limited) in their name to check their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

This research approach has been instrumental in Sam's success, leading to ventures like The Hustle (which was sold for tens of millions of dollars, an example of [[selling_companies_and_acquisitions | selling companies]]) and Hampton, a community for CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. It also helps in identifying [[developing_million_dollar_business_ideas | million-dollar business ideas]].

Derek, known online as "More Plates More Dates," has successfully leveraged his online presence and expertise to build multiple businesses, including a significant supplement company, Gorilla Mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. With nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, he has cultivated a highly engaged audience that trusts his product recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Origin Story and Strategic Expansion

Derek's journey into [[building successful businesses from scratch | building successful businesses from scratch]] began with affiliate marketing, focusing on SEO-driven content and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. He would recommend products he personally used, such as shampoo for hair loss prevention, earning small commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. These "piddly little affiliate commissions" were crucial in funding his first ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

A core principle for Derek was to "organically integrate things that you already use and truly believe in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. He emphasizes that if you simply promote anything for money, your credibility will vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. By promoting products he genuinely used, he built trust with his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. This foundation of trust allowed him to eventually replace affiliate recommendations with his own, higher-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

His passion for formulation, chemistry, and pharmacology naturally led him into the dietary supplement space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This systematic approach—identifying solutions people sought and then becoming the supplier—was key to his expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

## Gorilla Mind: A Flagship Supplement Business

Gorilla Mind, Derek's pre-workout and creatine supplement company, is a significant part of his business portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The business is estimated to be generating substantial revenue, potentially between six and eight million dollars a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The business thrives on high margins and high repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Branding and Product Philosophy

While the name "Gorilla Mind" might not align with general health supplements like multivitamins, Derek believes it's effective for "hardcore pre-workouts" and products designed to boost cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. He compares it to a brand like "Thorne" for general health products, suggesting that consumers would opt for a "Gorilla Mode pre-workout over Thorne's pre-workout" for its edgy branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

A unique aspect of Gorilla Mind is Derek's intimate involvement in product formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. He is the one who "has to be creative, come up with innovative ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, ensuring that every product released under his name meets his high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This personal investment makes Gorilla Mind the most time-consuming business for him, despite its perceived lower complexity compared to a telemedicine company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### Marketing and Growth Strategy

Gorilla Mind has seen massive success in the e-commerce space, drawing over a million visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Key elements of its growth include:

*   **Influencer Marketing:** Beyond Derek's own audience, Gorilla Mind heavily relies on influencer marketing with partners who also believe in Derek's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Their combined following is in the tens of millions, if not over 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
*   **Credibility & Trust:** The company's success and reputation, such as being a top-selling pre-workout on Amazon, provide significant credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This allows the brand to grow beyond Derek's direct content output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Products:** Influencers partnering with Gorilla Mind benefit from Derek's indirect endorsement and involvement in formulating their collaborative products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   **Retail Expansion:** The company is now expanding into retail, aiming for global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Operations and Team Structure

Derek's business partner, Chris ("Good Looking Loser"), handles the hands-on operational aspects, including warehouse fulfillment, distribution, legal, and accounting, from Idaho where Gorilla Mind's HQ is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Derek, based in Canada, focuses on marketing, content, product formulation, manufacturing, and supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The company employs an estimated 50 to 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Business Goals and Philosophy

Derek foresees both Gorilla Mind and Merrick Health becoming "billion dollar companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. He doesn't necessarily want to sell them, viewing the financial targets as "vanity metrics" similar to YouTube subscriber counts; the real satisfaction comes from the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### No Outside Funding

Remarkably, Derek has not raised any outside financing or funding for any of his businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. His approach of building these multi-million dollar brands from a significant, but not extraordinarily massive, audience (1.9 million subscribers) showcases the power of direct-to-consumer sales and strong personal branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### Seasons of Life

Derek subscribes to the philosophy of dedicating "seasons of your life" to specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. Instead of trying to achieve multiple ambitious goals simultaneously, he believes in going "all in on one of these goals at the expense of the others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This approach prevents doing everything "half-assed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. He found that having stability in his personal life (e.g., a long-term relationship) makes [[building a successful startup | building a successful startup]] and other companies significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

> "Try if I was single right now I would get half as much work done probably." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>

This strategic focus and organic growth, coupled with a deep understanding of his niche and audience, have been foundational to [[building successful businesses from scratch | building successful businesses from scratch]] in the supplement industry and beyond.

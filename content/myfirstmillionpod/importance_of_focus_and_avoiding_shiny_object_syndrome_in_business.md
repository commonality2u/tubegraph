Sabri Suby, a marketing agency owner and *Shark Tank Australia* personality, emphasizes that [[importance_of_focus_and_strategy_in_startups | focus]] is paramount when running businesses, particularly to avoid the pitfalls of [[managing_shiny_object_syndrome_in_business | shiny object syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Suby himself experienced significant ups and downs in his early career due to a lack of focus and constantly seeking the "next new sexy sales channel or the next new business model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Strategic Business Opportunities Through Focused Expansion

Suby suggests that a strong business opportunity lies in helping businesses expand their reach by introducing new traffic channels, without requiring upfront payment. This approach, which he calls a "Godfather offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, makes it "an offer that they simply can't refuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> because it involves no risk for the client and promises revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Success

Many businesses successfully operate with one primary traffic channel (e.g., Google Ads) but miss opportunities on others (e.g., Facebook Ads, TikTok) due to a lack of team, expertise, or failed past attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The "Godfather offer" addresses this by:
*   Offering to build and run funnels and ads on a new platform (e.g., Facebook, TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   Charging only a percentage of sales generated from the new channel, eliminating upfront costs for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Expanding E-commerce Reach

A similar strategy applies to e-commerce:
*   **Target:** Shopify stores not yet selling on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Pitch:** Research competitors' Amazon sales using tools like Similarweb to show potential revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Offer:** Manage the Amazon FBA process, starting simply and scaling up as results show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** A percentage of the sales from the new Amazon channel, allowing for quick client acquisition and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Suby advises "fishing in a pond where something like e-commerce works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, as established e-commerce stores are likely making money and can easily justify an investment that generates immediate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Low-Barrier Entry Points for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

For those starting with no skills, experience, or capital, Suby suggests strategies that leverage existing needs and high-value opportunities:

### Affiliate Marketing with Value-Add
With rising ad costs (CPMs) for businesses, especially SaaS companies feeling a pinch in payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:37]</a>, there's an arbitrage for those who can deliver customers at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Partner with SaaS companies offering high affiliate commissions (e.g., HubSpot 30% recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, Hyros up to $15,000 per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>).
*   **Approach:**
    1.  Pick a specific niche (e.g., chiropractors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
    2.  Build a complete, converting funnel (landing page, email flows, offers) for that niche *in advance* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
    3.  Offer this pre-built, ready-to-use funnel *for free* to businesses in the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
    4.  The catch: the client must sign up for the necessary SaaS product (e.g., HubSpot) through the affiliate link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Generates a high volume of customers for the SaaS product by providing significant value to the end-user upfront, addressing their need for a system and saving them time and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

### Live Chat Services for Small Businesses
Many small businesses lack the manpower or expertise to offer 24/7 customer support via live chat on platforms like Google My Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Offer live chat services on a commission-only basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.
*   **Pitch:** Highlight missed opportunities during off-hours by showing Google My Business traffic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.
*   **Offer:** Field and nurture leads, even closing some sales via chat, in exchange for a 20% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Start solo and then hire overseas support (e.g., Philippines) to handle volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This provides a clear return on investment (ROI) and avoids the need for a "convincing argument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

### TikTok Shop Affiliate/Agency Model
The exploding social commerce market, particularly TikTok Shop and upcoming YouTube Shopping, presents a massive opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy (Affiliate):**
    1.  Use tools like Cow Data or Fast Moss to find best-selling products on TikTok Shop and analyze viral videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.
    2.  Reverse engineer successful scripts and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.
    3.  Create AI-generated voiceovers (e.g., Eleven Labs) and visuals (e.g., Midjourney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
    4.  Produce and upload content daily as an affiliate, earning a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy (Agency):** Approach businesses running Facebook Ads and offer to manage their TikTok Shop presence for a retainer plus a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. Additionally, provide the viral TikTok creatives for their Facebook ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** This model allows individuals with "hustle and willingness to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a> to get paid while developing highly valuable and [[the_importance_of_goal_setting_in_business | timeless skills]] like copywriting, consumer psychology, video editing, and social media virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. These "horizontal skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a> can be applied to any business.

## The Importance of [[the_role_of_persistence_and_grit_in_business_success | Persistence and Grit]] (Killing the "Little...")

Suby advocates for a philosophy he calls "kill the little..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>, referring to the internal voice that discourages difficult tasks. This "best sales person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a> knows all your weaknesses and vices, trying to deter you from pushing through. Suby's approach is to not only ignore this voice but to "penalize it for being there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a> by doing *more* of the difficult task he initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>. This fosters a habit of keeping promises to oneself, which is crucial for [[the_role_of_persistence_and_grit_in_business_success | consistent progress]] and avoiding self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Fun and Showmanship in Business

Suby notes a common misconception that as people age or engage in business, they must become "vanilla" or "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. He found that focusing on having more fun in both life and business led to significantly more financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Campaigns:** An example is creating an ad campaign for his business that prioritized being "the funniest ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>, leading to a tripling of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.
*   **Controlled "Shiny Objects":** Instead of chasing external business opportunities (a form of [[managing_shiny_object_syndrome_in_business | shiny object syndrome]]), Suby scratches his entrepreneurial "itch" by integrating new and novel approaches (e.g., a new campaign, channel, or offer) into his main business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>.
*   **Showmanship as Currency:** "Entertainment is like the currency that buys the attention of your prospect and of your Marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>. Showmanship involves storytelling, stage presence, energy, and visual drama, making mundane business communications engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:00">[48:17:17]</a>. This is particularly relevant in the age of content creation and audience building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.
*   **Planning for Fun:** Just as one plans work, it's crucial to plan for fun, including holidays and new experiences, to bring "zest and life to your everyday business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

## Building a "Repeatable, Predictable Way" to Get Clients

Suby criticizes businesses that "pray to the internet gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:38:00">[53:38:00]</a>, hoping for cheaper ad costs or organic referrals, rather than having a systematic approach to client acquisition. Without a "repeatable, predictable way to actually put a dollar into a machine and turn it into three or five or $10 back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:10:00">[54:10:00]</a>, a business is merely an "expensive hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a>.

### The "Yes, Yes, Yes, No" Funnel
A key strategy for a repeatable sales process is the "Yes, Yes, Yes, No" funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Lead with valuable, free content (e.g., a free report, video, book) that educates and demonstrates expertise without immediately selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>. This gets the target market to "raise their hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>.
    2.  The content makes the audience think, "yes, yes, yes, that all makes sense, that's true, that's a great example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
    3.  At the end, the offer is made, and the ideal prospect concludes "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a> – not because the information was bad, but because they realize they lack the time, energy, or skill to implement it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The prospect is convinced of the provider's expertise and chooses to enlist their services rather than DIY. This approach works best when the free content genuinely provides value and is not a "thinly veiled sales pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Suby's own "Sell Like Crazy" book, which has sold over a million copies (many as free-plus-shipping), exemplifies this by giving away the full playbook without holding back "secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

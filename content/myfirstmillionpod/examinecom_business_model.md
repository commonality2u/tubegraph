Examine.com is an online platform that provides "nutrition information you can trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. It is considered a "favorite website" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a> by some, even ranking in their "top ten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Current Operations and Monetization

Examine.com's core operation involves poring through scientific studies to find definitive proof related to nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. They categorize information into:
*   What "work for sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   What "seem like they might be able to work but we can't say for certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   What "don't trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

The site has been operating for about a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Its early success was primarily driven by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. At some point, it experienced a "Google dive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>, after which it implemented a subscription revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Users can be paying members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. The site did not have ads at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a> and currently does not engage in affiliate marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>, by choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

The primary value proposition of Examine.com is its brand and the trust it has built with its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. The content strategy involves monitoring journals and new medical information to keep its content updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

## Perceived Under-Monetization

Despite its trusted brand, Examine.com is considered "one of the most under monetized sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. Its annual revenue is estimated to be around "two or three million a year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. However, it's believed that Examine.com could potentially be a "$100 million dollar a year [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | business]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.

## Proposed Growth Strategies

Several strategies are suggested to significantly increase Examine.com's revenue:

*   **Implement Affiliate Marketing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>: Even if done tastefully, without compromising trust, it could generate substantial revenue, similar to Wirecutter, which reportedly makes "close to nine figures in sales from affiliates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. This would involve telling users "which brands to buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   **Sell to Doctors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>: A similar company that sells information to doctors generates "$400 or $500 million dollars a year in sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a> by acting as a "Wikipedia for doctors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **Expand to Injuries and Illnesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>: Applying the same trusted information model to medical conditions beyond nutrition could serve a desperate audience seeking definitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
*   **Apply the Model to Crypto and Web3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>: Given the abundance of opinions and lack of trustworthy information in the [[crypto_casinos_and_their_business_models | crypto]] and Web3 space, an "examine.com for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a> could be highly valuable and "last a hundred years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

## Building Trust and Credibility

For a new venture adopting this model, especially in a field like [[crypto_casinos_and_their_business_models | crypto]], building credibility is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. Initial steps could include:
*   Starting a podcast to transparently share insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
*   Attending events to network and build trust within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.
*   Adopting Examine.com's content model of hiring writers to review white papers and provide objective opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   Avoiding anonymity, as trust is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

This type of information-based, trusted content [[insights_on_various_business_models_and_industries | business model]] can be incredibly long-lasting and profitable, similar to Consumer Reports, which continues to grow and generate nine figures in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.

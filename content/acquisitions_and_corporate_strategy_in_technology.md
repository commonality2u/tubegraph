This article explores insights into technology acquisitions and corporate strategy, primarily drawing from Nat Friedman's experiences, including the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft and Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.

## The Acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft

The acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft serves as a significant case study in strategic acquisitions within the tech industry. Nat Friedman, who would become CEO of GitHub post-acquisition, played a key role in advocating for and shaping this deal.

### Initial Proposal and Rationale
Friedman first suggested Microsoft acquire GitHub during his first week at Microsoft in March or April 2016, following Microsoft's acquisition of his company, Xamarin [00:40:55], [00:41:21], [00:41:27]. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, initially responded positively but with some reservations about feasibility [00:41:37].

A year later, Friedman formally proposed the acquisition in a memo to Nadella [00:41:40]. The core arguments were:
* Developers were increasingly making IT purchasing decisions, a shift from traditional IT-led procurement [00:42:08].
* While Microsoft was founded as a developer company, its contemporary image was more aligned with IT, and a new generation of developers lacked affinity with Microsoft [00:42:22] - [00:42:40].
* GitHub hosted the largest collection of these developers [00:42:44].
* Acquiring GitHub and running it competently would allow Microsoft to earn the right to be considered by this crucial developer community for its other products [00:42:52].

Rumors of Google's interest in GitHub may have also acted as a catalyst [00:41:49].

### Execution of the Deal
Nadella responded quickly and positively to Friedman's memo [00:42:58]. In a subsequent meeting with key Microsoft executives, Nadella affirmed the decision, proposing GitHub be run independently, similar to LinkedIn, with Friedman as CEO [00:43:19] - [00:43:23]. An initial valuation thought was around $2 billion [00:43:28]. The deal, from this point, moved rapidly, with a signed term sheet and public announcement within three weeks [00:43:38].

### Managing Post-Acquisition Skepticism
The acquisition was met with significant skepticism from the developer community [00:44:17] - [00:44:24]. The deal leaked on a Friday before its Monday announcement, leading to a weekend of negative online reactions and calls to leave GitHub [00:45:13] - [00:45:25].

Friedman, feeling a deep responsibility towards developers [00:44:39], [00:45:00], implemented several strategies to build trust:
* The official announcement clarified GitHub would run as an independent company with Friedman, known for his open-source background, as CEO. This helped to somewhat calm fears [00:45:31] - [00:45:52].
* On his first day as CEO, Friedman's immediate strategy was to address community feedback. He presented a list of popular feature requests from a community-maintained GitHub repo and tasked the team with shipping one fix by the end of the day [00:46:04] - [00:46:43].
* The goal was to demonstrate that GitHub's priority remained its developers, not integrating Microsoft products like Skype prematurely [00:47:15] - [00:47:26].
* This led to a "100 days" plan of daily shipments, creating positive feedback loops, energizing the team, and offering rapid learning opportunities for Friedman about the company's strengths and weaknesses [00:47:39] - [00:48:37]. This approach was seen as instrumental in earning trust [00:48:48].
* As part of the acquisition, Microsoft pledged its patent portfolio to open source, a significant move given GitHub's existing pledge and Microsoft's past stance on patents [01:03:04], [01:03:29].

## Factors Influencing Acquisition Success and Failure

Friedman notes that most acquisitions are destructive of value [00:49:02]. Key factors include:
* **Cultural Mismatch:** The value of an innovative company often lies in its unique culture's ability to produce new innovations. This "sensitive harmonic" is fragile and can be destroyed when merged with a different corporate culture [00:49:06] - [00:49:33].
* **Talent Departure:** Key individuals who are passionate about the product and customers may leave if they don't wish to work for the acquirer, or they may become disempowered. The loss of this load-bearing talent can significantly impact long-term success [00:49:55] - [00:50:15].

## Strategic Investments: Microsoft and OpenAI

Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, a year before GPT-3's release, demonstrates another facet of corporate strategy [00:50:54]. 
* This $1 billion investment, urged by Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott, was a prescient bet on AI as the next major technological wave [00:51:03], [00:51:18] - [00:51:36]. This aligns with broader discussions on [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]].
* OpenAI's Sam Altman recognized the need for resources from a company like Microsoft to pursue large-scale AI development [00:51:53] - [00:52:05].
* Friedman notes that while $1 billion might not seem substantial for Microsoft, many other large companies could have made similar bets but did not [00:52:15] - [00:52:22].

## Broader Trends in Corporate Strategy and Acquisitions

### The Economics and Rationale for More Acquisitions
Friedman believes that, economically, more acquisitions make sense than are currently happening [01:10:27] - [01:10:32].
* Large companies possess established distribution channels and customer relationships, which are expensive and difficult to build [01:09:07] - [01:09:17].
* Acquiring a product and leveraging these existing channels can offer immediate and obvious gains [01:09:24] - [01:09:33].

### Internal Barriers to Acquisitions
Despite the economic logic, internal dynamics within large companies often hinder acquisitions [01:09:39] - [01:09:47]:
* It's often easier to secure funding for internal projects than for acquisitions, even for similar amounts. Approval and cultural buy-in processes differ [01:09:53] - [01:10:04].
* Failed acquisitions tend to be more public and embarrassing than unsuccessful internal product efforts [01:10:09] - [01:10:20].

### Evolution of Incumbent Behavior
Friedman identifies two major shifts in how incumbent companies behave:
1. **Learning from "The Innovator's Dilemma":** After Clay Christensen's book, incumbents became more aware of disruption dynamics and learned strategies to avoid it, such as willingness to cannibalize existing products and setting up separate channels for new offerings. This has contributed to more stability among incumbents over the last 15 years [01:31:34] - [01:32:05].
2. **Embracing AI:** Unlike previous platform shifts (web, mobile, cloud) where incumbents often derided new technologies, they are now paying significant attention to AI and actively adopting it [01:32:12] - [01:32:51]. This highlights the [[role_of_selfteaching_and_motivation_in_education]] in keeping up with technological shifts and applications. 

## Personal Motivations within Large Corporations

Friedman's decision to leave Microsoft and GitHub, despite his love for the product and team, was driven by a desire to return to a smaller, more nimble "startup guy" environment [01:11:36] - [01:11:40]. He found the extensive coordination required to navigate large organizational structures, as experienced during the development of GitHub Copilot (involving Microsoft, OpenAI, and GitHub), less energizing over time [01:10:48] - [01:11:13]. His transition reflects on [[the_future_of_programming_and_ai_tools_like_github_copilot]] and how entrepreneurial spirits adapt to changing environments.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is considered a very important and potential topic for examiners, especially given the increasing prevalence of HPV infections and the use of HPV vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## HPV Strains

HPV strains are categorized into two main types:
*   **Low-risk strains** The low-risk strains of HPV are 6 and 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. These strains are associated with causing condyloma acuminata, also known as genital lesions, in both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **High-risk strains** The high-risk strains are 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Both HPV 16 and 18 are responsible for [[screening_and_management_of_cervical_cancer | cervical cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Pathogenesis of Cervical Cancer

A very important aspect of HPV is its pathogenesis, specifically how the Human Papillomavirus causes [[screening_and_management_of_cervical_cancer | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   The HPV virus produces two types of proteins: E6 and E7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   E6 binds to P53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   E7 binds to RB (retinoblastoma protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   P53 and RB are tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   By binding to these proteins, E6 and E7 immortalize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. When tumor suppressor genes are deactivated or immortalized, it leads to [[screening_and_management_of_cervical_cancer | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Therefore, E6 binding to P53 and E7 binding to RB is how HPV leads to [[screening_and_management_of_cervical_cancer | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> [!Note] Key Takeaways
> *   HPV 16 and 18 are the main high-risk strains responsible for [[screening_and_management_of_cervical_cancer | cervical cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
> *   The E6 protein targets P53, and the E7 protein targets RB, leading to the deactivation of tumor suppressor genes and subsequent cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

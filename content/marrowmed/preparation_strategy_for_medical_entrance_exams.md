Dr. Shloka, who secured an impressive Rank 3 in her first attempt at the INICET exam, shares her comprehensive [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation strategies]] and [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | mindset]] for [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | competitive medical exams]]. Her [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | approach to medical exams]] highlights the importance of consistency, smart resource utilization, and a strong support system.

## Dr. Shloka's Background and Personality

Dr. Shloka graduated from BJ Medical College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. She is described as very sincere and serious about her studies, with nothing able to beat her hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Studies have always been her priority since school, and she sacrificed many hobbies to achieve her dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### The Role of a Support System

Dr. Shloka emphasizes that achieving her rank was not an individual effort but required an entire support system, including family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Her family and friends kept her sane, especially during the intense last one to one and a half months of preparation, which involved many exams and mock tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Their support extended to handling her late-night panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow for [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | Study and Preparation Strategy]]

Dr. Shloka began using Marrow from her third professional year until the end of her internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### Videos and Notes
*   **Initial Phase (Third Prof onwards):** She primarily used the main videos for concept building, which also proved beneficial for her college prof exams requiring theory writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Internship Phase:** During her internship, she transitioned to revision videos and previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. She watched revision videos for subjects when she was tired and needed passive learning, such as after duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. She aimed to strengthen concepts using main notes first, before shifting to revision notes in the last one to two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Starting new material during an internship is advised against, as it can add stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Edition Shifts:** When Marrow editions changed (from 5 to 6, then to 8), Dr. Shloka decided not to order new notes. Instead, she used her existing Edition 5 notes and added points from Edition 8 online notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. She found Edition 8 to be a more concise version with many tables and flowcharts, making it easy to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This strategy prevented the stress of having new, untouched notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Notes/Revision Tool:** Dr. Shloka created a "WhatsApp chat with myself" where she would send volatile information, tables, or syndromes as pictures or messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This quick and easy method allowed her to revise key points during her last month of preparation and even during postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. This technique proved highly productive, helping her answer four to five questions in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

### Qbank Strategy
*   **Early Engagement:** Dr. Shloka started solving the Qbank alongside the main videos and notes when initially learning subjects in her third and fourth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Revisiting Qbank:** She would reset the Qbank to solve questions again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. She noted a significant improvement in her performance after gaining a holistic view and understanding of clinical subjects (e.g., medicine, surgery), which helped with questions in pharmacology and pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **Completing the Qbank:** She solved the entire Qbank module at least once or twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Test Taking and Analysis: Crucial for [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | Effective Study]]

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **[[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | Importance of Starting Early]]:** Dr. Shloka advises starting GTs as early as possible, ideally in the third professional year, to get a feel for the exam format, especially with section-wise patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. It takes 5-10 GTs just to understand the "game" of solving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
*   **Syllabus Completion Fallacy:** She dismisses the idea of waiting to complete the syllabus before starting GTs, stating that the syllabus is never truly completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Starting early helps develop guessing power and the ability to apply knowledge from other subjects to fill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:**
    *   **Beginning of Final Year:** Bi-weekly live GTs (every 15 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.
    *   **End of Final Year/Start of Internship:** Weekly GTs on Sundays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.
    *   **End of Internship:** Increased frequency to two to three GTs per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

### GT Review Strategy
*   **Timely Review:** She preferred reviewing GTs just before they expired (on the same day in the morning or just before), ensuring the questions were fresh in her mind, saving time on re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Mistakes:** If time was short, she would immediately review skipped and wrong answers after seeing the result, which typically took an hour to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

### Improving GT Scores
*   **Targeting Weak Subjects:** To overcome plateaus or dips in GT scores, Dr. Shloka used Marrow's feature that ranks performance by subject percentile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. Her strategy was to work on the lowest-performing subjects to bring their percentiles up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. For example, instead of continuously studying strong subjects like Medicine, she focused on volatile or difficult subjects like Anesthesia, which ultimately improved her overall GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

### Mock Test Experience
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** In a mock test before INICET, Dr. Shloka's rank was lower than usual (33rd) because she overthought questions, assuming they had to be difficult for INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. This experience made her alert for the actual exam, teaching her to take some questions at face value and not overthink options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. She believes this "flaw" in the mock test helped her achieve her final rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

## Last Month Revision and PYQ Approach

### Last Month Strategy
*   In the final month, Dr. Shloka focused solely on revision notes, PYQs, and her personalized WhatsApp notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. She advocates against introducing new material just before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

### Approach to Previous Year Questions (PYQs)
*   **Beyond Rote Learning:** While many topics were repeated in INICET, the options were confusing and went in-depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. Simply doing PYQs was insufficient; in-depth knowledge of the topic was required, gained by reading explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.
*   **Defining a PYT:** A "PYT" (Previous Year Topic) isn't a single question from 10 years ago, but a topic repeated several times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>. Extreme or random questions are meant to be skipped, as wasting time on them turns the entire syllabus into "PYTs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>. For example, trauma in surgery is a repeated PYT where the answer is often airway management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Depth and Multiple Corrects:** In the INICET exam, ruling out options was difficult due to multiple correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. It required a "leap of faith" in several questions, as having in-depth knowledge of all topics is not practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>.

## Exam Day and Marrow App Features

### Exam Day Resilience
*   Despite her PC crashing thrice during the INICET exam, Dr. Shloka maintained her focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. This experience highlighted how regular practice of tests and GTs in various situations prepares one for unexpected challenges during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. She attempted 194 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

### Favorite Marrow App Features
*   **Search Function:** She particularly loved the search feature, which allowed her to directly navigate to any module by searching for a single word or topic, acting like a "Google" for her studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Feature:** While she personally bookmarked too many things and couldn't clear them effectively (leading to thousands of bookmarks), she acknowledged it as an amazing feature if managed regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

Dr. Shloka's journey underscores a highly focused and logical [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques]] and [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | mindset]], leading to exceptional results in [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | competitive medical exams]].

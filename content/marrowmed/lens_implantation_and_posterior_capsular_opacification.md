## Overview of Lens Implantation
Lens implantation refers to [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care | cataract surgery]], a procedure where a lens is implanted into the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This is typically done using the Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE) technique, and an intraocular lens (IOL) is usually implanted after two years of age in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>.

## Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO)

Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO) is the most common late complication following [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care | cataract surgery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. It typically occurs between 6 to 12 months after the initial surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Symptoms and Signs
Patients with PCO often complain of worsening vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

On examination, PCO can present with two main types of opacification:
*   **Elsching pearls** These are pearl-like deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. They are the most common type, accounting for 90% of PCO cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Soemmering ring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

These deposits can be observed behind the implanted intraocular lens (IOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

> [!info] Diagnosis
> PCO is typically diagnosed via slit lamp examination, which reveals the characteristic deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis of Post-Cataract Surgery Complications
While PCO is the most common late complication, other conditions can also cause worsening vision after [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care | cataract surgery]]:

*   **[[Corneal opacity classifications | Corneal opacity]]**: This would be visible on the cornea and is easily differentiated from PCO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Subluxation of lens (ectopia lentis)**: This condition primarily leads to diplopia (double vision) rather than just blurring of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Bullous keratopathy**: This is a corneal problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. It can occur as part of Irvin-Gass syndrome, which also includes cystoid macular edema and vitreous strand touching the cornea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Irvin-Gass syndrome usually appears 6 to 10 weeks after surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The approach to preparing for exams like the FMG is evolving, with a growing emphasis on [[conceptual_vs_memory_based_questions | concept-based learning]] over rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

## Evolution of the FMG Exam

The FMG exam is no longer based solely on single-liner questions or popular sessions that emphasize rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. It is becoming more clinical-based, concept-based, and integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. To solve integrated questions, it is crucial to have clear concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Without clear concepts, students will not be able to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## Dr. Kriti Singh's Approach

Dr. Kriti Singh, who scored 248 in her first FMG attempt, highlighted the importance of concepts in her preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

*   **Early Focus on Concepts:** When she started her preparation in her fourth year, her primary focus was on "making concepts," watching videos, and revising notes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. She did not initially focus on solving MCQs at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Integrated Learning:** Dr. Singh noted that the FMG exam questions were more integrated, reinforcing the need for clear concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Timely Preparation:** Developing strong concepts cannot be achieved in just three or four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. It requires starting early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### Advice for Juniors

Dr. Kriti Singh's key advice for juniors preparing for the exam is to:
*   Start early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   Be consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

She emphasizes that without consistency, it is impossible to clear any exam, not just the FMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Starting early is crucial because many students mistakenly believe they can begin preparation only after reaching India, which is an incorrect mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Dr. Narendra, a second-year Radiology resident at AIIMS, emphasizes the critical role of strong foundational knowledge for medical students and those preparing for competitive exams like the FMG exam and INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. His unique journey, having completed MBBS in Nepal and using Marrow during his final years, highlights the effectiveness of in-depth preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Starting Early and Building Basics

Dr. Narendra began using Marrow in his final year of MBBS, primarily for his university examinations, before focusing on entrance exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He expressed regret for not starting earlier, indicating the [[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | importance of starting early in medical exam preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

His initial focus was on the four major final year subjects: Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics & Gynecology, along with Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He asserts that the best preparation involves studying properly throughout MBBS, starting from the very first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

The core advice is to "always build on the basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. A strong foundation can only be established through a detailed understanding of concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>, which is essential for scoring high and achieving good ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. This reinforces the [[importance_of_building_strong_basics_in_undergraduate_medicine | importance of building strong basics in undergraduate medicine]].

## The Value of In-depth Learning

Dr. Narendra believes that medicine is a "beautiful branch" and the deeper one goes into a topic, the better the understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This depth doesn't make things more difficult; rather, it makes them easier because a strong grip on a concept ensures it's not easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Even retaining 50% of an in-depth understanding is often sufficient for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This directly relates to [[understanding_difficult_medical_concepts | understanding difficult medical concepts]].

Platforms like Marrow provide this in-depth knowledge, covering gaps in patient exposure or institutional limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. This ensures students can access the best knowledge, regardless of their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### Integration of Subjects

A key aspect of modern medical exams is the integration of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Final year clinical subjects (Medicine, Surgery, Ob-Gyn, Pediatrics) have significant overlap with pre- and para-clinical subjects such as Pharmacology, Pathology, Physiology, Microbiology, Anatomy, and Embryology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

Understanding these clinical subjects thoroughly helps in comprehending the pre- and para-clinical subjects as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Questions in current exams are rarely isolated to a single subject; instead, they often contain clinical hints to aid in answering, emphasizing an integrated approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. For instance, medicine is integrated with pharmacology, pathology, and physiology, while radiology is integrated with orthopedic surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### The Role of Question Banks and Grand Tests

After watching video lectures, solving questions from a question bank is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This strategy helps to identify and fill any gaps in knowledge, as exam questions often test specific points that might be missed during video viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The question bank acts as a "net," highlighting frequently tested important areas within the broader subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | importance of solving MCQs in medical exams]].

Grand Tests are invaluable for assessing preparation levels and identifying areas needing additional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. The analytics provided by these tests help pinpoint weak and strong subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Dr. Narendra discovered his weakness in minor/short subjects through a Grand Test, prompting him to focus on them using revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This underscores the [[importance_of_exams_for_medical_students | importance of exams for medical students]].

## No Shortcuts to Success

Dr. Narendra and Dr. Abbasali collectively stress that achieving high scores and ranks requires patience and a commitment to elaborate, in-depth learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. There are no shortcuts or quick resources that can provide the necessary depth and clarity for such achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. The FMG exam, in particular, is designed to test a candidate's fundamental knowledge as an MBBS graduate, focusing on the minimum standard required for practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Preparing for one exam in depth will ultimately benefit preparation for all medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

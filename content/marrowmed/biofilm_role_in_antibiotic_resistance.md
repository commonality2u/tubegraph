Biofilms are complex structures formed by certain bacteria, significantly impacting their susceptibility to [[antimicrobial_treatments | antibiotics]] and their pathogenicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Formation and Characteristics
Biofilms form when bacteria produce a polysaccharide layer around their cell wall, known as slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. When this slime accumulates, it leads to the development of biofilms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Key roles of biofilms in bacterial pathogenicity include:
*   **Adhesion** Biofilms assist in bacterial adhesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, allowing them to cling to surfaces.
*   **Protection** They protect bacteria from bacteriophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Impact on Antibiotic Susceptibility
A critical aspect of biofilms is their ability to reduce bacterial susceptibility to [[antimicrobial_treatments | antibiotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Biofilms act as mechanical barriers, enclosing bacterial colonies and preventing the entry of [[antimicrobial_treatments | antibiotics]] into the core of the colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This means that despite an [[antimicrobial_treatments | antibiotic]]'s sensitivity profile, an infection might not resolve if a biofilm is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

It is incorrect to assume that biofilms can be easily washed off catheters, thus avoiding removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In cases where a biofilm is causing persistent infection, removal of the colonized device (e.g., a catheter) is often necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Notorious Biofilm-Forming Bacteria
Several bacteria are known for their strong ability to form biofilms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Examples include:
*   *Staphylococcus epidermidis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   *Streptococcus mutans* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

Infections caused by these organisms, especially in the presence of medical devices like central venous lines, often lead to persistent fever and poor response to [[antimicrobial_treatments | antibiotic]] treatment due to biofilm formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For instance, *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is a common cause of bacteremia in IV-catheterized patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

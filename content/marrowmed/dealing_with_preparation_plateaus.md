In the journey of preparing for competitive exams, hitting a plateau in scores or progress is a common challenge. Dr. Jasurya, who secured Rank 5 in the May 2025 INIC exam, shared insights into how he managed these periods during his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Understanding Plateaus
Dr. Jasurya emphasizes that growth in preparation is "not a linear growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Scores do not always steadily increase; there will be times when progress seems to halt.

## Strategy for Overcoming Plateaus
Dr. Jasurya's primary strategy for [[maintaining_motivation_and_managing_performance_plateaus | dealing with plateaus]] involved utilizing the analytics from [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | Grand Tests (GTs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>:

*   **Identify Weak Subjects**: After a Marrow GT, a list of the five subjects where performance was weakest is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Targeted Study**: Dr. Jasurya would dedicate the next 10 to 15 days to intensively studying these identified weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Observe Improvement**: This targeted approach consistently led to an increase of "two three questions" in his subsequent GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

This method is described as a "wonderful strategy" and a "simplistic strategy in expression, but to do it actually takes a lot of effort and time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Key Takeaway
Dr. Abasali, summarizing the common themes from toppers, highlights that when scores plateau, one should:
*   Assess [[role_of_reviewing_grand_test_gt_performances in_preparation | GT analytics]] to identify weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   Focus on those specific subjects to gradually improve scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   Avoid excessive worry about scores throughout the preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

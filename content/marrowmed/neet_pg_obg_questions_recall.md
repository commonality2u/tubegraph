From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

This article summarizes the recall of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) questions from [[NEET PG 2024 Exam Analysis | NEET PG 2024]] Session 1 and Session 2, as presented by Dr. Sakshi Arora Hans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The questions were largely predictable, often stemming from previous year's topics (PYQs), and frequently required the application of common sense and elimination strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Session 1 Questions

### Drug Avoided in PPH for Bronchial Asthma Patient
A patient with bronchial asthma who develops Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) should avoid **Carboprost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

**Drugs for PPH Management:**
*   **Oxytocin:**
    *   Dose: 20 International Units (IU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Administration: Always given as IV infusion, never as IV bolus, to avoid hypotension and cardiac arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   Dilution: Should be given in electrolyte-rich media; if given in electrolyte-deficient media (like Dextrose 5%), it can lead to water intoxication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Methylergometrine:**
    *   Dose: 0.25 mg IM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   Contraindications (TOPR mnemonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
        *   **T**wins (after delivery of first twin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
        *   **O**rganic heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
        *   **P**eripheral vascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
        *   **R**h-negative pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
        *   Preeclampsia/eclampsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> (added to the mnemonic's 'P')
    *   Side Effect: IV administration can lead to hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Carbetocin:** Synthetic oxytocin used in active management of third stage of labor, but not in PPH management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Misoprostol (PGE1):**
    *   WHO Recommended Dose: 800 mcg sublingually or orally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

    *   Dose: 250 mcg IM, repeatable every 15-90 minutes, max 8 doses (2 mg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Contraindications: Bronchial asthma, pulmonary hypertension, amniotic fluid embolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Side Effect: Diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Tranexamic Acid:** 1g also used in PPH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Mode of Delivery in Twin Pregnancy
The mode of delivery depends on the presentation of the first twin (the twin closer to the internal os) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Cesarean Section (CS):**
    *   Indicated for monochorionic monoamniotic twins or conjoined twins (delivery at 32-34 weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   If the first twin is breech or transverse lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Vaginal Delivery (VD):**
    *   Possible in dichorionic diamniotic twins and monochorionic diamniotic twins if the first twin is cephalic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   If both twins are cephalic, both can be delivered vaginally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   Avoid methylergometrine after the first twin's delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   If first twin is cephalic and second is breech, deliver first vaginally and second by assisted breech delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   If first twin is cephalic and second is transverse lie, deliver first vaginally, then perform internal podalic version to convert the second to breech, followed by breech extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
        *   **Internal Podalic Version:** Only indication is second twin transverse lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Done in OT under general anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Contraindicated in previous Cesarean section patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean) in Twins:** Not contraindicated in twin pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, if there's a previous CS, and the first twin is cephalic but the second is transverse, CS is performed because internal podalic version is contraindicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Diagnosis of Prolapse from Image
Images depict various types of pelvic organ prolapse:
*   **Cystocele:** Prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall due to bladder herniation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

*   **Vault Prolapse:** Prolapse of the vaginal vault (stump) after hysterectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Grid for Prolapse Diagnosis
The grid shown, containing terms like "anterior wall," "perineal body," "total vaginal length," and "posterior wall," is used to diagnose genital organ prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

**Classification Systems for Uterine Prolapse:**
*   **Shaw Classification (older):** Reference point was the introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   First degree: Cervix inside vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Second degree: Cervix at the level of introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   Third degree: Cervix and uterus outside introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   Procidentia: Entire uterus, cervix, and vaginal wall prolapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **POP-Q (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) Classification (current):** Reference point is the Hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

    *   Stage 3: Prolapsed part >1 cm below Hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   The grid is used in POP-Q to measure distances relative to the Hymen for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Obstetric Hysterectomy and Placenta Accreta Spectrum
A patient with previous CS and antepartum hemorrhage underwent CS with hysterectomy due to unseparated placenta, indicating Placenta Accreta Spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

*   **Pathologies:** Absent Nitabuch's layer and defective decidua basalis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Risk Factors:** Present pregnancy with placenta previa and previous history of CS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. (Note: Previous history of placenta previa is NOT a risk factor, but present pregnancy placenta previa is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>).
*   **Investigation of Choice:** Doppler ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
    *   Ultrasound Signs: Placental lacunae ("moth-eaten" appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, loss of hypoechoic area behind placenta (absent decidua basalis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, disruption of continuous white line from bladder to uterine serosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Management:** Hysterectomy (Cesarean hysterectomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Vacuum Application: Flexion Point
The **flexion point** for vacuum application lies 3 cm anterior to the posterior fontanelle and 6 cm posterior to the anterior fontanelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The center of the vacuum cup lies here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The rim of the cup lies at the posterior fontanelle, or 3 cm posterior to the anterior fontanelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Cancer Cervix Staging
Growth extended to the pelvic sidewall and hydronephrosis indicates **Stage 3B** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Parametrium involvement:** Stage 2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Pelvic Lymph Nodes:** Stage 3C1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

*   If tumor size ≥4 cm (e.g., Stage 1B3 and 2A2): Chemoradiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   From Stage 2B onwards: Chemoradiation (Cisplatin as a radiosensitizer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Primary Amenorrhea with Short Stature and Karyotyping
A short girl with primary amenorrhea and a karyotype of 45 XO indicates **Turner Syndrome** (Monosomy X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Mosaic Turner Syndrome:** Some cells 45 XO, others 46 XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Can have streak ovaries on one side and dysgenetic testes on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Dysgenetic Testes:** Premalignant, require gonadectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. All Turner syndrome patients should have karyotyping done to check for mosaicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

### Primary Amenorrhea with Normal Development and Organs
A female with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development, normal pubic hair, normal uterus, and normal ovary, but with imperforate Hymen, suggests **Cryptomenorrhea** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. This is typically seen in 46XX females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Contrast with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome:** In AIS, LH levels are high, FSH normal, testosterone high (male range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Gonads are testes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. Breast development is proper, but pubic and axillary hair are scanty due to androgen insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Uterus is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### Secondary Infertility and Amenorrhea with Laparoscopic Image
A P1L1 female with secondary infertility and amenorrhea (since 2 years) after an uneventful previous delivery, with a laparoscopic image showing white areas (tubercles) on the peritoneum, indicates **Genital TB** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   **Characteristics of Genital TB:**
    *   Secondary infection, commonly from lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
    *   Spread: Hematogenous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
    *   Most common PID in virgin females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
    *   Most common affected site: Fallopian tube (ampulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
    *   Most common symptom: Infertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
    *   Most common menstrual problem: Polymenorrhea (later secondary amenorrhea due to Asherman syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
    *   Most common pelvic finding: Absolutely normal pelvis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   Investigation of choice: Endometrial biopsy (premenstrual phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. For virgins, first-day menstrual blood biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
    *   Treatment: ATT for 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. For infertility, IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
    *   HSG findings (ideally contraindicated, but done after ATT): Beaded appearance, lead pipe appearance, golf stick appearance, cotton wool appearance, tobacco pouch appearance, bilateral cornu block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

### MTP Act (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act)
A 14-year-old rape victim at 22 weeks pregnant wants to terminate.
*   Pregnancy can be terminated up to 24 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
*   Opinion required:
    *   Up to 20 weeks: One doctor's opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
    *   Between 20-24 weeks: Two doctors' opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   Severe congenital anomalies: No upper gestational limit, but requires approval by a Medical Board (Gynecologist, Pediatrician, Radiologist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   Consent: Female's consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. If minor, legal guardian's consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

### PCPNDT Act (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act)
A pregnant woman with four girl children is interested in knowing the sex of the current child. As a radiologist, you should check for congenital anomalies but **not look at the sex of the baby** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. Radiologists must fill a form declaring they will not determine or disclose the sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

### Indication to Stop Magnesium Sulfate
Magnesium sulfate is an anticonvulsant, not an antihypertensive, with a low therapeutic range (4-7 mEq/L) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Pritchard Regime (Loading Dose):** 10g IM (5g in each buttock) + 4g IV (20% solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Maintenance Dose:** 5g IM every 4 hours, continued for 24 hours after vaginal delivery or last seizure (whichever is later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
*   **Monitoring before maintenance dose:**
    *   Deep tendon reflexes: Should be **present** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   Urine output: Should be ≥100 ml in 4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

*   **Indication to stop (or hold dose):** Urine output <100 ml in 4 hours (e.g., 60 ml) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. Renal function is checked only for maintenance doses, not loading doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Investigations for Cervical Erosion with Foul Smelling Discharge
Patient presents with spotting, cervical erosion, and foul-smelling discharge. The best approach is **Liquid Cytology and HPV testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. While colposcopy-directed biopsy would be ideal, if not available as an option, then Pap smear (liquid cytology) and HPV testing are appropriate for screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

### Earliest Time for IUCD Insertion
*   **Post-placental insertion:** Within 10 minutes of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Postpartum insertion:** Up to 48 hours after delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **Interval insertion:** After 6 weeks postpartum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

**Contrast with Tubal Ligation:**
*   Tubal ligation can be done from 24 hours after delivery up to one week (postpartum ligation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>, or after 6 weeks (interval ligation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   Laparoscopic tubal ligation is contraindicated in the postpartum period due to uterine height; mini-laparotomy is used instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

### Identification of Chocolate Cyst (Endometrioma)
A characteristic image of a chocolate cyst (also called endometrioma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.
*   **Management:** Only managed surgically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.
    *   If desirous of pregnancy: Do not manage surgically until family is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
    *   Asymptomatic cyst <5 cm: No intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
    *   Asymptomatic cyst >5 cm or symptomatic cyst of any size: Laparoscopic cystectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

### Management of Pregnant Patient on Warfarin with Prosthetic Valves
A 37-week pregnant patient on Warfarin for prosthetic valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **General Principle:**
    *   Bioprosthetic valve: Aspirin only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
    *   Mechanical valve: Aspirin + anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
    *   History of DVT (no valve): Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) regardless of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Anticoagulation in Mechanical Valves:**
    *   Up to 12 weeks: Warfarin (if dose <5mg) or LMWH (if Warfarin dose ≥5mg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
    *   12 to 36 weeks: All patients kept on Warfarin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
    *   At 36 weeks: Switch from Warfarin to Heparin (LMWH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. Stop aspirin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
        *   Reason for switch: Warfarin is strong anticoagulant (risk of PPH) and crosses placenta (risk of fetal intracranial hemorrhage during VD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.
    *   Day of delivery: Stop LMWH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

Iron absorption and its subsequent metabolism are crucial physiological processes, frequently examined due to their importance in health and disease, including conditions like hemochromatosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Dietary Iron Absorption

Iron absorption primarily occurs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucosal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

1.  **Dietary Source**: Dietary iron is typically available in the ferric form (Fe3+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
2.  **Conversion**: To be absorbed, the ferric form (Fe3+) is converted to the ferrous form (Fe2+) by the enzyme **ferric reductase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
3.  **Entry into Mucosal Cell**: The ferrous form (Fe2+) is then transported into the mucosal cell via a **divalent metal transporter (DMT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
4.  **Heme Contribution**: Breakdown products of heme also contribute to the ferrous form (Fe2+) inside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Intracellular Iron Handling

Once inside the mucosal cell, iron can be handled in two main ways:

1.  **Storage**: The ferrous iron (Fe2+) can be converted to the ferric form and stored as **ferritin**, which is the primary storage form of iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This stored iron can be used for future needs, such as red blood cell development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
2.  **Transport to Blood**: The remaining ferrous iron (Fe2+) can be transported out of the mucosal cell into the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Iron Transport

For transport into the blood:

1.  **Exit from Mucosal Cell**: The ferrous iron (Fe2+) is transported from the basolateral side of the mucosal cell into the blood with the help of the channel protein **ferroportin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
2.  **Conversion in Blood**: In the blood, the ferrous form (Fe2+) is converted back to the ferric form (Fe3+) by the enzyme **hephaestin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
3.  **Blood Transport**: The ferric iron (Fe3+) then combines with **transferrin** for transport throughout the body via the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Common Misconception
> Ferric reductase converts Fe3+ to Fe2+, not Fe2+ to Fe3+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

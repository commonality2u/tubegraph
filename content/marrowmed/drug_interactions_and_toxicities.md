Drug interactions can lead to various adverse effects, including increased [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]] or altered drug efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Types of Drug Interactions and Resulting Toxicities

### Enzyme Inhibition Leading to Toxicity
When one drug inhibits the [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] of another, it can lead to increased concentrations of the latter drug, causing [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]].
*   **Carbamazepine and Erythromycin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
    *   **Carbamazepine** is an anti-epileptic drug known for causing cerebellar [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]], which presents as ataxia and dysarthria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It can also cause hypersensitivity reactions like Steven Johnson syndrome or rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   **Erythromycin** is an enzyme inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   **Interaction**: If a patient on carbamazepine takes erythromycin, the erythromycin inhibits the [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] of carbamazepine, increasing its concentration and leading to symptoms like imbalance and gate ataxia due to cerebellar [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Drug-Induced Cholestasis
Certain drugs can cause cholestasis without portal inflammation by competing with bile acids for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Drugs like estrogen, erythromycin, and cyclosporin move out of hepatocytes via the P-glycoprotein pump (MDR1 pump), the same pump used by bile acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. When these drugs are given, they compete with bile acids, inhibiting their excretion and leading to cholestasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Estrogen and androgenic steroids are known to cause cholestasis without portal inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions
When two drugs have similar pharmacological actions, their combined use can lead to exaggerated effects or [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]].
*   **Imipramine and Diphenhydramine**:
    *   **Diphenhydramine** is an H1 blocker, primarily used as an anti-muscarinic drug due to its highly sedative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
    *   **Imipramine** is a tricyclic anti-depressant that increases norepinephrine and serotonin, but also blocks muscarinic, H1, B2, and alpha 1 receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
    *   **Interaction**: Both diphenhydramine and imipramine block muscarinic receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Their combined use can lead to increased anticholinergic side effects.

## Drug-Specific Toxicities and Side Effects

### Thalidomide
Thalidomide is used for various conditions, including [[drugs_used_in_multiple_myeloma_and_associated_risks | multiple myeloma]] and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Side Effects**: Its significant side effects include:
    *   Sedation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
    *   Phocomelia (teratogenic effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
    *   Rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   Thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
    *   Constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
    *   The most common side effects are sedation and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Its immunosuppressive action is not due to anti-metabolite effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Drugs with anti-metabolite effects are typically folate inhibitors (e.g., methotrexate) or purine/pyrimidine analogs (e.g., azathioprine, leflunomide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Overdosing and Tolerance in Relation to Toxicity
*   **Acute Tolerance**: When high doses of a drug are given, the patient can suddenly develop [[types_of_drug_tolerance | tolerance]] and not produce an adequate effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Examples include alcohol and cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Patients might increase their dose to achieve the desired effect, which can lead to [[poison_classification_and_effects | toxicity]] or overdose (OD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Cross Tolerance**: Developing [[types_of_drug_tolerance | tolerance]] to one drug (Drug A) can automatically confer [[types_of_drug_tolerance | tolerance]] to another drug (Drug B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. For example, a patient who has developed [[types_of_drug_tolerance | tolerance]] to alcohol (a GABA-A receptor modulator) might also develop [[types_of_drug_tolerance | tolerance]] to a benzodiazepine like diazepam (a GABA-A agonist), potentially requiring higher doses for therapeutic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

A research study focused on the incidence of measles within a population of 100 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.

## Defining Incidence
Incidence is determined by the formula: total number of new cases divided by the total susceptible population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. The susceptible population refers to individuals who are at risk of contracting the infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A multiplicative factor, typically 100 or 1,000, is often used in the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Measles Incidence Calculation
In the study population of 100 children:
*   10 children had a previous history of measles infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>.
*   20 children were newly affected for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

To calculate the incidence:
1.  **Identify new cases:** There were 20 new cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Determine susceptible population:** Out of the 100 children, 10 already had a history of infection, making them immune. Thus, the susceptible population was 100 - 10 = 90 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Calculate incidence:** 20 (new cases) / 90 (susceptible population) = approximately 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:30">[03:13:30]</a>.

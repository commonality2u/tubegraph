The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Act 2021 introduces updated guidelines for terminating pregnancies in India. These guidelines cover indications, required medical opinions based on gestation, and confidentiality measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

## Indications for Medical Termination of Pregnancy

A pregnancy can be terminated under various circumstances, including:
*   **Therapeutic Reasons**: If there is a risk to the life, physical, or mental health of the pregnant woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **Eugenic Reasons**: When there is a risk to the fetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Grounds**: Pregnancies resulting from rape or incest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   **Contraception Failure**: In cases of contraception failure for any couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

## Place of MTP

Medical Termination of Pregnancy must always be conducted in a government institution or any place authorized by a designated committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

## Required Medical Opinions Based on Gestation

The number of medical opinions required depends on the duration of the pregnancy:
*   **Less than 20 weeks of gestation**: The opinion of one registered medical practitioner is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
*   **Between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation**: The opinion of two registered medical practitioners is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Above 24 weeks of gestation**: Approval from a medical board is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

### Medical Board Composition
A medical board typically includes:
*   One obstetrician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>
*   One pediatrician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>
*   One radiologist (or sonologist if a radiologist is unavailable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>
*   One independent member appointed by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>
*   Notably, a lawyer is not a part of the medical board for MTP approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

## Specific Indications for 20-24 Weeks

While all indications mentioned previously apply for pregnancies less than 20 weeks (including contraception failure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>, terminations between 20 and 24 weeks are permitted only in selected cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>:
*   Pregnancies due to rape or incest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   When the pregnant person is a minor girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   When the pregnant person is suffering from mental illness or mental retardation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   Pregnancies occurring in cases of mass disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   When there is a change of marital status, such as becoming a widow or getting divorced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

If the gestation is above 24 weeks, termination is only conducted with medical board approval and only when there is a substantial fetal anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. The medical board decides if the anomaly is significant enough for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.

## Emergency Situations

In life-threatening emergency situations, there is no restriction on the duration of gestation; termination can be performed at any time to save the mother's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

## Confidentiality and Record Keeping

*   **Confidentiality**: Absolute confidentiality must be maintained regarding the details of the MTP, which are not to be disclosed to anyone except law enforcement agencies. Violation of this is punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **Record Preservation**: All medical records related to MTP must be preserved for a duration of 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Reporting**: MTP records should be forwarded monthly to the district health authorities, specifically the chief medical officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

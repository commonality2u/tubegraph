Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory arthritis that is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, meaning it involves the spine and joints but tests negative for rheumatoid factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. It is more common in males than females, typically affecting young to middle-aged individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Clinical Features

Key clinical features and diagnostic indicators include:

*   **Back Pain and Stiffness** Patients commonly present with back pain and stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This stiffness is characteristic of inflammatory arthritis, improving with activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Eye Symptoms** Recurrent episodes of uveitis (eye symptoms) are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Spinal Involvement** The condition primarily affects the axial spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   **Sacroiliitis** Sacroiliitis, the inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, is an essential diagnostic criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Mobility** Fusion of the spine leads to decreased lumbar spine movement and reduced chest expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Pathology** The underlying pathology is enthesopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Genetic Marker** A strong association with HLA-B27 is observed; patients are typically HLA-B27 positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Radiological Signs

Several [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | radiological signs]] are indicative of ankylosing spondylitis:

*   **Sacroiliitis** Fusion of the sacroiliac joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Bamboo Spine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>
*   **Dagger Sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>
*   **Trolley Track Sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>

These [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | radiological signs]] have been frequently tested in previous exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Lupus vulgaris is a specific form of [[dermatopathology | cutaneous tuberculosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. It is characterized by chronic and granulomatous inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Lupus vulgaris typically presents as a slow, progressive, painless plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The lesion is generally asymptomatic, suggesting chronic inflammation rather than acute inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
Key features include:
*   **Progressive, painless plaque** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   **Areas of atrophy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>: This occurs because the granulomatous inflammation is replaced by tissue fibrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Active progressive margin**: The lesion's periphery is active and moving along tissue planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Central atrophy and scarring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Diagnosis
To confirm the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris, the following tests are useful:

### Skin Biopsy
A skin biopsy is crucial for ascertaining the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Histopathological findings**: On biopsy, [[dermatopathology | tuberculoid granulomas]] are observed, which are characteristic of chronic inflammatory diseases like tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These granulomas often contain Langhans giant cells, which are multinucleated cells with a horseshoe arrangement of nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Chest X-ray
A chest X-ray should be performed in every patient with lupus vulgaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This is because 10% to 20% of patients with lupus vulgaris may have concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Screening for pulmonary involvement is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Diascopy
Clinically, "apple jelly nodules" can be observed on diascopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Diascopy is a test where a glass slide is pressed on the lupus vulgaris lesions to visualize the granulomas, which appear with an "apple jelly" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

>[!INFO] Key Diagnostic Features
>The combination of a skin biopsy showing tuberculoid granulomas and Langhans giant cells, along with the clinical finding of "apple jelly nodules" on diascopy, are highly suggestive of lupus vulgaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Differentiating between true seizures (epileptic seizures) and pseudo seizures (non-epileptic seizures) is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and management. Pseudo seizures are often indicative of a psychological conflict or stress leading to a conversion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:02">[02:42:02]</a>.

## Key Differentiating Factors

| Feature            | True Seizures                                                                                                       | Pseudo Seizures                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Occurrence**     | Can happen at any time, any place, in the presence of any person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. | Generally happen in the daytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. Usually occur in the presence of known people, such as family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>. Not nocturnal or during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. |
| **Stereotypical**  | Mostly stereotypical, meaning every attack will be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:35">[02:39:35]</a>.                     | Can be of changing or varying attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Episodes may differ (e.g., movement of different limbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. |
| **Memory**         | Patients typically do not remember the events during the episode (amnesia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. | Patients usually remember the events during the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>.                                                                                                   |
| **Tongue Bite**    | Can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:11">[02:40:11]</a>.                                                 | Generally not seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>.                                                                                                    |
| **Incontinence**   | Can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:16">[02:42:16]</a>.                                                 | Generally not seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>.                                                                                                    |
| **Plantar Response** | Upgoing plantars are very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:28">[02:44:28]</a>.                           | Plantars are downgoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:44">[02:38:44]</a>.                                                                                                    |
| **Prolactin Levels** | Increase in prolactin levels is a very common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:48">[02:47:48]</a>.                   | Normal prolactin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:54">[02:58:54]</a>.                                                                                                |
| **Postictal EEG**  | There will be a kind of slowing of waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>.                          | Remains normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:16">[02:13:16]</a>.                                                                                                      |
| **Duration**       | Variable.                                                                                                           | Regains consciousness after 15 to 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.                                                                                        |

## Management

### True Seizures
*   **Pharmacological Treatment**: Antiepileptic drugs such as Valporate are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.
*   **Dietary Interventions**: Ketogenic diet can be useful in resistant seizure disorder, especially in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:55">[02:04:55]</a>.

### Pseudo Seizures
*   **Therapy**: Behavioral therapy, specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>. The aim is to identify the underlying conflict or stress and help patients develop healthier coping mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:46">[02:44:46]</a>.

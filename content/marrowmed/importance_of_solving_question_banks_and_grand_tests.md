Dr. Mayank, who achieved an impressive 252 marks in the FMG exam, emphasizes the critical role of question banks and grand tests in his preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. His strategy highlights starting early, building strong conceptual foundations, and consistently applying knowledge through rigorous practice.

## Early Preparation and Foundational Learning
Dr. Mayank began preparing for the FMG exam from his second year of MBBS, utilizing Mero for all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. He credits the depth and conceptual clarity provided by Mero's videos, particularly Dr. Rakesh's medicine lectures, for his strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He found these conceptual videos essential for understanding subjects like medicine, which integrate various disciplines such as pharmacology, pathology, physiology, microbiology, and community medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## [[importance_of_question_banks_and_test_series | Effective Utilization of Question Banks]]
Dr. Mayank started using question banks from the very beginning of his preparation, even before he had given the FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Consistent Practice with Question Banks
He consistently solved NEET PG question banks alongside his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. His routine involved watching videos and then immediately solving questions from the relevant [[importance_of_question_banks_and_test_series | question bank]] daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Integrating QBank Information into Notes
Dr. Mayank would add new or important information from the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | question bank]] to his notes, which were primarily printed Mero notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. His final revision notes consisted of rapid revision notes combined with these added QBank insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Custom Modules for Comprehensive Revision
In the last six months of his preparation, Dr. Mayank heavily relied on custom modules, solving 100 to 200 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. He included questions from all 19 subjects in these modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

This approach offered several benefits:
*   **Staying connected with all subjects:** It prevented forgetting other subjects while focusing on one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Repeated revision:** Facilitated continuous [[importance_of_revision_and_grand_tests | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   **Exam scenario simulation:** Randomizing questions from multiple subjects tested his ability to find answers without prior knowledge of the subject, simulating the actual exam environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Importance of Grand Tests (GTs)]]
Dr. Mayank started giving GTs in his sixth year and maintained a good score from his first attempt, aiming for 200+ marks in every GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. He took all FMG GTs and even some NEET PG GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear and Identifying Weaknesses
Dr. Mayank strongly advocates for giving GTs, stating that many students avoid them due to fear of low marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

He emphasizes:
*   **GTs reveal weaknesses:** Low scores in GTs before the exam are preferable to low scores in the actual exam, as GTs help identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Baseline assessment:** Taking a GT is like stepping on a weighing machine to know your current status (overweight or underweight), providing a baseline to work from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

## Key Advice for Juniors
Dr. Mayank advises juniors to:
*   **Start early:** Begin preparation in the second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
*   **Watch main videos sincerely:** Build a strong conceptual base, as rapid revision videos are only recaps and not replacements for detailed learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.
*   **Make and use notes:** Integrate information from videos and question banks into comprehensive notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Solve question banks regularly:** Don't be afraid of the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | question bank]], as it's crucial for solving questions in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   **Take Grand Tests without fear:** GTs are vital for identifying weaknesses and improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Dr. Mayank stresses that achieving a high score requires consistent effort, watching regular videos, and meticulously solving the entire [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | question bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. He also advocates for balancing study with fun, ensuring a sustainable and effective preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

Dr. Sayani, a student from Kolkata National Medical College, achieved an impressive All India Rank 5 in her first attempt at the November INI CET exam [00:00:11]. Her success highlights the significant role that a strong [[family_support_in_academic_success | support system]] plays in a student's academic journey.

## A Pillar of Strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

During an interview, Dr. Abbas, an Orthopedics faculty with Marrow, observed Dr. Sayani's parents sitting by her side, acknowledging their "enormous part" in her journey [00:00:37]. He noted that having such "support pillars" behind a student provides "hope and inspiration," especially since "a lot of people struggle with having a lot of support from family" [00:00:57].

Dr. Sayani herself affirmed the crucial [[role_of_parental_support_in_academic_success | role of her parents]], stating, "they have been my [[family_support_in_academic_success | support system]] throughout my journey of MBBS and even in my school days" [00:01:14]. This consistent [[family_support_in_academic_success | support]] from her formative years through her medical studies underscored its lasting impact.

## Motivation and Gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

A significant motivator for Dr. Sayani was the desire to bring happiness to her parents. She expressed her gratitude, saying, "I'm so grateful that I can make my parents happy" [00:01:21]. This sentiment was echoed later when she reaffirmed her motivation to "make my parents happy" and achieve her dream branch, alongside making herself happy [00:02:49].

The interviewer, Dr. Abbas, recognized the parents' pride, stating, "you must be immensely proud of your daughter right now because she has scored an amazing rank" [00:01:26]. The culmination of her efforts, supported by her family, led to this remarkable achievement, bringing immense joy to her parents who were encouraged to "enjoy your daughter has just done the amazing and we are so proud of her" [00:12:50].

This case study of Dr. Sayani demonstrates that beyond individual effort and dedication, the [[the_importance_of_support_systems_in_exam_success | presence of a strong family support system]] is invaluable, providing both emotional encouragement and a powerful motivation for achieving academic excellence.

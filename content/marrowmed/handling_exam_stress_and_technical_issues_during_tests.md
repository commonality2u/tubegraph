Successful exam performance involves not only preparation but also the ability to manage stress and unexpected technical challenges. Dr. Shloka, who secured Rank 3 in the INIC exam on her first attempt, shared her experiences and [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | strategies]] for dealing with these pressures.

## Importance of a Strong Support System

During intense preparation periods, especially in the final months leading up to exams, a robust support system is crucial. Dr. Shloka emphasized that she "couldn't have achieved this alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Her family and friends played a vital role in keeping her "sane during this prep," particularly during the "really intense" last one and a half months when many exams and mock tests were ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. They were there to handle "late night panic attacks" and supported her throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This highlights that success is often a "teamwork" effort involving family and friends, alongside individual dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Managing Study-Related Stress

### Avoiding "FOMO" and Unnecessary Changes
Switching study materials midway through preparation can add significant stress. Dr. Shloka advised against falling into a "FOMO trap" by changing notes or materials unnecessarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. When her Marrow notes updated from edition five to eight, she chose to add new points to her existing notes rather than getting a new set, as a new, untouched set would have been "more stressful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Similarly, starting entirely new learning methods or resources during internship can "just add on to your stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### Strategic Test-Taking and Overthinking
Mock tests can reveal crucial insights into one's [[balancing_emotions_and_mindset_during_exam_preparation | mindset]] and [[testtaking_techniques | test-taking techniques]]. In a mock test before the INIC exam, Dr. Shloka, who usually ranked in the top 20, dropped to 33rd place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. She realized she had "overthought some questions" and "psyched [herself] into choosing the wrong answer" because she assumed the exam had to be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>. This experience made her "really alert" for the actual exam, teaching her to "take some questions at their face value" and "not overthink my options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. She believed this flaw in the mock test actually helped her achieve her final rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

### Accepting Uncertainty
It's impractical to have in-depth knowledge of every topic. Dr. Shloka noted that some questions, especially in the INIC exam, required "a leap of faith" because "having such an in-depth knowledge of all topics is just not practical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. She acknowledged that some "extreme questions" are "meant to be skipped" and don't necessarily need deep study if they are not consistently repeated as [[ent_exam_questions_and_strategies | previous year topics]] (PYTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Technical Challenges During Exams

Dr. Shloka faced significant technical difficulties during her actual INIC exam, with her "PC crashed thrice," twice before starting and once during Section A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. This required her to change systems and caused disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Despite these setbacks, she maintained her focus and achieved a top rank.

This remarkable resilience stemmed from consistent practice in "test based scenarios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. Regularly doing Grand Tests (GTs) "in all sorts of situations prepares you for the worse which can happen during the exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. Her ability to stay focused and dedicated even when disturbed highlights the benefit of consistent practice in simulated exam environments.

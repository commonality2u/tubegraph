Dr. Shreya Gandhi, an Orthopedics faculty member with Marrow, successfully cleared the FMG exam on his first attempt, scoring 244 [00:00:09]. His journey highlights the critical role of diligent study, consistent practice, and strategic revision.

## Strategic Use of Learning Resources

Dr. Gandhi began using Marrow towards the end of his third year of medical school and continued until the examination [00:01:28].

### Video Lectures and Notes
He adopted a balanced approach to video lectures and notes:
*   **Main Videos**: For major subjects like Obstetrics & Gynaecology (Obs & Gynae) and Surgery, he completed all main video lectures, including clinical subjects like Ophthalmology (Opha) and Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) [00:03:34].
*   **Revision Videos**: For shorter, more scoring subjects (5-10 questions in the exam), he utilized the concise revision videos. His strategy was to ensure 90% accuracy in these subjects by multiple revisions of the notes associated with these videos [00:02:58].
*   **Notes Strategy**: Dr. Gandhi used pre-made notes, actively annotating and marking important areas. This allowed him to quickly navigate and focus on key points during subsequent revisions, even with the main notes [00:05:27]. This method provided a "sense of completion," boosting his confidence to attempt unfamiliar questions [00:07:06].

## The Power of Practice Questions

A cornerstone of Dr. Gandhi's success was his extensive engagement with practice questions.

He emphasized that the exam is not theory-based, requiring familiarity with question patterns [00:07:25].

### Question Bank Approach
*   **Sequence**: He first watched videos, then read notes, and then solved questions [00:07:56].
*   **NEET PG & FMG Sections**: Initially, he focused on the NEET PG section until October/November 2024, before shifting to the FMG section closer to his exam [00:08:06].
*   **Custom Modules**: To manage time and cover the FMG question bank, he extensively used custom modules, applying hashtags like "NEET," "FMG," "clinical," and "most commons" [00:08:22].
*   **Previous Year Papers**: Dr. Gandhi solved previous year papers multiple times, even when he knew the answers. This was to ensure reflexive recall, saving time for more challenging questions [00:08:36].
*   **Quantity**: He estimates solving approximately 10,000 to 12,000 questions throughout his preparation [00:13:36]. He noted that this extensive [[using_question_banks_and_practice_modules | question practice]], rather than just Grand Tests, was key to his success [00:13:48].

## Grand Tests and Performance Analysis

Despite the common hesitation among students, Dr. Gandhi stressed the [[importance_of_grand_tests | importance of Grand Tests]] for self-evaluation.

### Grand Test Strategy
*   **Timing**: He started giving Grand Tests in September, only after gaining a sufficient knowledge base (completing around 15-16 subjects) to ensure meaningful scores and avoid demotivation [00:10:31].
*   **Frequency**: He gave 5-6 Grand Tests, initially once a month, aligning them with his revision cycles [00:11:11].
*   **Analytics**: A crucial step was analyzing the post-test analytics to identify weak areas and silly mistakes, especially when tougher questions were correct but easier ones were missed [00:11:27]. Public Health and Social Medicine (PSM) was one such subject he continuously worked on due to its vast information [00:12:10].
*   **Review Process**: He prioritized reviewing wrong questions first, bookmarking important ones or making notes. He also briefly reviewed correct answers to confirm his reasoning [00:12:49]. This analytical approach is vital for [[importance_of_personalized_revision_techniques_and_mock_tests | personalized revision techniques and mock tests]] and overall [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | exam strategy and revision tactics]].

## Key Advice for Future Aspirants

Dr. Gandhi offers several crucial recommendations for juniors aiming to clear the FMG exam:

*   **Start Early**: Begin preparation in the initial years of medical school (e.g., third year), as it's a long journey with extensive syllabus [00:14:49].
*   **Right Resources**: Choose reliable resources like Marrow and stick with them, trusting the faculty and content [00:15:56]. Marrow is considered sufficient, even for competitive exams beyond FMG [00:16:01].
*   **Dedication**: Study with genuine dedication, not just for the sake of it [00:15:02].
*   **Regular Question Practice**: Solve questions consistently and regularly; don't be afraid of them [00:15:05]. This is a core aspect of [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | importance of revision and practice questions]].
*   **Consistency**: Dedicate at least an hour daily to studies, putting in more hours on free days [00:16:53]. Avoid skipping days unless feeling overwhelmed, taking a day off every week or 10 days [00:17:02]. This highlights the [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | importance of consistency in exam preparation]].
*   **Study Partner**: Find a good study partner to make the journey easier and more supportive [00:17:14].

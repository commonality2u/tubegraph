## In Camera Trials

An in camera trial is a closed court proceeding where the public and media are not permitted to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:30">[09:29:30]</a>. This term is a misnomer, as it does not mean the trial is recorded on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Such trials are conducted inside closed court chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

In camera trials are typically held for privacy cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, including:
*   POCSO cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>
*   Rape cases, particularly for the examination of a rape victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>
*   Matrimonial cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>

## Victim Examination Laws

### Mandatory Treatment and Reporting (Section 397 BNSS)
Under Section 397 BNSS, all doctors, regardless of whether they are from government, private, or semi-government sectors, are mandated to immediately treat victims of rape, vitriol (acid attack), or POCSO cases free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Police intimation by the doctor is compulsory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. Any violation of this mandate, such as a doctor failing to treat these victims or charging them for treatment, is punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

### Presumption of Absence of Consent (Section 120 BSA)
Section 120 of the BNSaki Act (BSA) addresses the presumption of absence of consent in certain rape prosecutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. If the act of sexual intercourse is proven, and the victim states that consent was not given, it is legally presumed that consent was indeed absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. In such cases, the burden of proof lies on the accused to demonstrate that consent was obtained for the sexual act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

## Consent for Medical Procedures

For a general physical examination, the minimum age for a person to give consent is 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>. If the person is below 12 years, consent must be obtained from their guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

For major procedures, such as surgery, invasive procedures, radiological procedures, or blood transfusions, the minimum age for a person to give valid consent is 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>.

### Invalid Consent
Consent obtained under the following circumstances is considered invalid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>:
*   From a person less than 12 years of age (for major procedures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>
*   From an insane individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:13:00">[46:13:00]</a>
*   Through means of undue influence or threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:17:00">[46:17:00]</a>
*   From an intoxicated person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>

In all these situations, the consent of a guardian must be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.

### Emergency Procedures (Section 30 BNS)
Under Section 30 BNS, a doctor is legally protected if they perform emergency life-saving procedures without obtaining explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>. This applies when it is impossible to obtain consent in a critical situation to save the patient's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>.

[[endemic_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | Endemic fungal atypical pneumonia]] is caused by five specific fungi: *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, *Paracoccidioides*, and *Talaromyces marneffei* (formerly *Penicillium marneffei*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. All five of these causative agents are [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | dimorphic fungi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, meaning they exist in both a yeast form and a mold form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations
The [[clinical_manifestations_of_atypical_pneumonia_caused_by_fungi | clinical presentation]] for pneumonia caused by any of these five fungi is generally the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Patients typically present with cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath), and notably, without consolidation in the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Treatment Strategies
The [[treatment_strategies_for_malaria | treatment]] for all five of these fungi is identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The [[drug_of_choice_for_specific_infections_and_conditions | drug of choice]] depends on the severity of the case:
*   For mild to moderate cases, Itraconazole is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   For severe cases, liposomal Amphotericin B (OTB) is the preferred [[antimicrobial_treatments | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Laboratory Diagnosis
While the clinical presentation and [[antimicrobial_treatments | treatment]] are consistent across these five [[fungal_and_bacterial_infections | fungal infections]], their laboratory diagnosis is where they differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. As [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | dimorphic fungi]], diagnosis involves identifying both their yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Histoplasma
*   **Disease Names**: Histoplasmosis, Darling's disease, Ohio Valley Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Characterized by intracellular yeast cells, meaning yeast is found within macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. *Histoplasma* is the only intracellular fungus among these five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Shows tuberculate conidia, which are conidia surrounded by tubercules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Blastomyces
*   **Disease Names**: Blastomycosis, Gilchrist's disease, North American Blastomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

*   **Disease Names**: Paracoccidioidomycosis, South American Blastomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. It is called South American Blastomycosis because its mold form (pear-shaped conidia) resembles that of *Blastomyces*, and it is commonly found in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### Talaromyces marneffei

This fungus produces a distinctive red pigment on SDA (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. It is most commonly observed in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

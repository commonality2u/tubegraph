Dr. Hamza, who secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 9 in a medical entrance examination, emphasizes the crucial role of solving Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) in his preparation strategy. Despite having previously achieved an AIR of 185 in the NEET exam, his dedicated focus on MCQs was instrumental in significantly improving his rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

## Effective Use of Question Banks

Dr. Hamza utilized Marrow's question bank, noting its high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. He particularly valued:
*   **Concise and Crisp Explanations:** The explanations provided for each question were to the point yet comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Images:** The inclusion of good quality images enhanced the learning experience and encouraged further practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **"Pearls" for Broad Perspective:** The "pearls" section at the end of explanations offered a wider understanding of the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

He primarily focused on solving [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | Previous Year Questions (PYQs)]] initially, considering them a priority, especially since he joined the platform only two months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Daily Practice Strategy

To improve his [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | MCQ skills]], Dr. Hamza set a target of solving at least 200 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. His daily routine involved:
*   **Subject-Specific Practice:** Dedicating one subject per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Combination of PYQs and Custom Modules:** Solving 100 PYQs and 100 questions from a custom module for that specific subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Thorough Subject Coverage:** He ensured every single subject was covered comprehensively by doing 100 custom module questions for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Developing MCQ Skills and Bookmark Strategy

Dr. Hamza highlights that the ability to eliminate options and choose the correct answer is a skill that develops with consistent [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_revision | question practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. It's not something that happens overnight but requires day-by-day practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

### Strategic Bookmarking
He recommends bookmarking not only questions answered incorrectly but also those answered correctly, especially if there's a possibility of forgetting the information or if the explanation provides valuable extra details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. For example, a question might ask about a known instrument, but its explanation could include images and details of other lesser-known instruments, making it worthy of a bookmark for future review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Importance of Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. Hamza strongly recommends taking [[importance_of_solving_question_banks_and_grand_tests | Grand Tests (GTs)]] as their ranks correlate very closely with the actual main exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Attempt Strategy:** In GTs, he aimed to attempt all 200 questions to maximize practice and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. In the actual exam, he attempted 196 out of 200 questions, leaving only those that were "completely out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Reviewing GTs:** He emphasizes the importance of reviewing every question in a GT to understand the correct answers and learn from mistakes, otherwise there's no point in giving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Impact of MCQ Practice on Rank

Dr. Hamza attributes his significant rank improvement from NEETPG (AIR 185) to INI-CET (AIR 9) directly to strengthening his [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | MCQ skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. He admits that during his NEET preparation, his MCQ skills were "almost zero," believing that theory alone was sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. However, the intensive MCQ practice during his INI-CET preparation proved to be a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. This shift in strategy was influenced by a friend, Krish, who encouraged him to utilize Marrow's Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

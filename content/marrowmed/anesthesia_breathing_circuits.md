Anesthesia breathing circuits, also known as breathing systems, are essential components in the delivery of anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Understanding their classification and specific uses is crucial for medical professionals.

## Classification of Breathing Systems

Breathing systems are broadly classified into three main categories:

1.  **Open Circuit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
    *   Historically used, but not commonly in practice today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   An example is the Schimmelbusch mask, which involved covering the patient's nose and mouth with a guard piece and applying ether or chloroform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

2.  **Semi-Closed Circuits (Mapleson Circuits)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
    *   Very popular and widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   Divided into six categories by Mapleson: A, B, C, D, E, and F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

3.  **Closed Circuit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
    *   This circuit type has a provision to absorb carbon dioxide using soda lime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Soda lime is a chemical containing calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Advantages**: Reduces fresh gas flows, making it economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   **Disadvantages**: The circuit can be bulky, increasing chances of disconnection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Generally used for long-duration procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Details of Mapleson Circuits

Understanding key facts about Mapleson circuits is important for entrance examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Mapleson A Circuit
*   Also known as the Magill circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   Circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   For spontaneous ventilation, the fresh gas flow (FGF) should be equal to the minute ventilation (MV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Modification**: The Lack circuit is a coaxial modification of the Mapleson A, meaning it's a "circuit within a circuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In the Lack circuit, the inner tubing carries expiratory gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Mapleson B and C Circuits
*   These circuits are considered obsolete and are not commonly used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   In Mapleson B and C, the APL valve is close to the patient end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Mapleson D Circuit
*   Circuit of choice for controlled ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   The APL valve is away from the patient end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Modification**: The Bain circuit is a coaxial modification of the Mapleson D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. In the Bain circuit, the inner tubing carries oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   For controlled ventilation in the Bain circuit, the fresh gas flow should be 1.6 times the minute ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Modified Mapleson D circuits (like the Bain circuit) are commonly available in hospitals and used for controlled ventilation, but generally not for longer surgeries due to larger gas flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Mapleson E Circuit
*   Also known as Ayre's T-Piece (IR TPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   This circuit forms the basis for the construction of ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   In Mapleson E and F circuits, there is no APL valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Mapleson F Circuit
*   This is the [[jackson_rees_circuit_in_pediatric_anesthesia | Jackson Rees modification]] of the Mapleson E circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   The [[jackson_rees_circuit_in_pediatric_anesthesia | Jackson Rees circuit]] is the circuit of choice for children or [[jackson_rees_circuit_in_pediatric_anesthesia | pediatric anesthesia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is a frequently asked question in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Airway Management Devices

Laryngeal Mask Airways (LMAs) are crucial [[use_of_anesthetic_equipment_in_clinical_practice | anesthetic equipment]] used for airway management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

*   LMAs are classified into generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   A key characteristic of a second-generation LMA is the presence of a drain tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   Examples of second-generation LMAs include Proseal LMA, i-gel LMA, and LMA Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   The Ambu Aura 40 is an example of a first-generation LMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. The "40" in Ambu Aura 40 signifies that it can be reused up to 40 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Ambu Aragain is the only second-generation LMA produced by the Ambu company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   Other first-generation LMAs include LMA Classic and LMA Fast Track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

It is important to remember that [[importance_of_anesthesia_knowledge_in_medical_entrance_exams | anesthesia knowledge in medical entrance exams]] often focuses on core areas like airway management, basic and advanced cardiac life support, and anesthetic drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

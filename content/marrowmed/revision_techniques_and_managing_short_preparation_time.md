Dr. Phillip, who achieved Rank 6 in the INI CET May 2025 exam after starting preparation only in January, provides insights into his [[Exam strategy and revision tactics | revision tactics]] and how he maximized his [[Strategies for maximizing performance during exam time | performance]] with limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Approach to Short Preparation Time

Dr. Phillip's preparation period was approximately five months, from January to May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He emphasized that he knew there was "no other option now" than to prepare effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Key strategies for managing a short preparation window:
*   **Prioritize Question Banks:** He primarily used question banks and test series to shorten the duration of revision, finding main videos "tedious" given the time constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The question bank was deemed sufficient due to its comprehensive explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Focused Question Solving:** His main preparation involved solving questions and then reviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He completed approximately 700 to 720 question bank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of Custom Modules:** After initial subject-wise completion of question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, he utilized custom modules to compile important questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. From March onwards, this involved reviewing all previously answered questions (correctly and incorrectly) and creating mixed-bag custom modules of all subjects for concurrent [[Revision techniques and managing study notes | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Targeted Video Review:** For very tricky questions or unclear concepts, especially in first-year subjects like anatomy and biochemistry where he lacked confidence, he would refer to main videos for clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Specific Revision Techniques

### Question Bank and Bookmarking
Dr. Phillip completed his first revision of all subjects by finishing approximately 500 question bank modules within two to two and a half months (January-February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

His [[use_of_bookmarks_and_notetaking_strategies_for_exam_preparation | bookmarking strategy]] included:
*   Marking difficult questions.
*   Identifying questions he perceived as important for the exam, specifically those that many candidates would be able to solve, rather than obscure factual questions that very few would know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Initially, he bookmarked around 3,000 questions during his first pass, which he subsequently reduced to 500-600 questions after reviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
GTs were an integral part of his [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences | preparation]] and [[time_management_and_testtaking_techniques | test-taking technique]]:
*   **Initiation:** He began taking GTs after completing six to eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Initially, he took GTs once every 10 to 12 days, increasing to once a week closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Review Process:** GTs were reviewed either on the same day or the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. His review pattern prioritized:
    1.  Questions he skipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    2.  Questions he answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    3.  Questions he answered correctly by eliminating other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    He did not review questions he was very sure about due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Progress Tracking:** He used GT graphs and analytics to monitor his progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. When scores dipped, he would persevere, understanding that "it will surely drop and then it will rise again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. GTs helped him understand if his preparation was appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Identifying Weaknesses:** GT analytics helped him identify his weakest subjects. He would revise the "bottom five subjects" from the graph before the next GT for a more thorough review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Marrow Features
Dr. Phillip found specific Marrow features helpful for his preparation:
*   **Delta MCQ Discussion Videos:** Especially valued those that explained why certain options were incorrect and why others were correct, focusing on frequently mistaken topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Magic Modules:** These modules compiled questions that he answered incorrectly, proving very helpful for targeted [[approaches_to_effective_notetaking_and_revision_techniques | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Advice for Students

*   **Start Early (if possible):** For students in their tough years, he advises starting [[Timeline for exam preparation | preparation]] by reading standard textbooks to build a good base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Path:** There are multiple ways to achieve a good rank, not just by watching main videos or revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Students should trust their own [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | preparation path]], especially if they feel they are on the right track by reviewing GTs, and not be influenced by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Monitor Progress:** What ultimately matters is whether one is progressing, which can be checked using GT graphs and analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Persevere Through Dips:** It is normal for scores to drop, but with correct preparation, they will rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. GTs are essential for gauging the appropriateness of one's [[time_management_skills_during_exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

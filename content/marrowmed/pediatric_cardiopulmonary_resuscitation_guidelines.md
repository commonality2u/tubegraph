[[pediatric_cardiopulmonary_resuscitation_guidelines|Pediatric CPR]] is a consistently important topic for examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

## Chest Compressions

### Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio
The chest compression to ventilation ratio varies based on the number of rescuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>:
*   **Single Rescuer:** The ratio is 30:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
*   **Two Rescuers:** The ratio should be 15:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

### Rate and Depth of Compressions
*   **Rate:** The usual rate for chest compressions is approximately 100 to 120 per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Depth:** The depth of compression should be at least 1/3 of the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the child's chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
    *   This is approximately 4 cm in an infant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
    *   In children beyond infancy, it is approximately 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

### Chest Recoil
After each chest compression, it is crucial to allow time for the chest to fully recoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. Full recoil facilitates venous return to the heart for the subsequent compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

## Medications in Pediatric CPR

### Adrenaline
Adrenaline is a life-saving medication used in [[pediatric_cardiopulmonary_resuscitation_guidelines|pediatric resuscitation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Dose:** The dose is 0.01 mg per kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>, or 0.1 ml per kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Concentration:** It must always be diluted to a 1 in 10,000 concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Maximum Dose:** The maximum dose of adrenaline is 1 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Routes of Administration:**
    *   Intravenous (IV) is the preferred route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
    *   Intraosseous (IO) is also an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
    *   Endotracheal (ET) tube administration is an alternative if IV or IO access cannot be obtained, but it is least preferred due to erratic absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Repetition:** Adrenaline can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes as needed if the heart rate does not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### Adenosine
Adenosine is **not** used in the management of [[pediatric_cardiopulmonary_resuscitation_guidelines|pediatric CPR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Its primary use is for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, given intravenously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

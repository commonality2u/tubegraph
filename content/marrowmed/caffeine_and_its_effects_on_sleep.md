Caffeine is a substance commonly consumed to combat [[Caffeine and its effects on sleep|difficulty falling asleep]] or to increase wakefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Its primary role in wakefulness involves its interaction with adenosine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Role of Adenosine in Sleep Regulation
Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating sleepiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Accumulation**: At the beginning of the day, adenosine accumulation in the brain is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. As the day progresses and cognitive and brain functioning continue, adenosine starts to accumulate more and more, particularly in the basal forebrain area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Effects**: This accumulation of adenosine increases lethargy, fatigue, and ultimately leads to drowsiness or sleepiness, culminating in sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This mechanism explains why individuals become tired and sleepy as evening and night approach after a day of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Caffeine's Mechanism of Action
Caffeine exerts its stimulant effects by blocking adenosine receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Specifically, caffeine targets and blocks adenosine 1 (A1) receptors and adenosine 2a (A2a) receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Alertness**: By blocking these receptors, caffeine increases arousal, attention, and can briefly enhance focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This is why people often consume caffeinated beverages before activities requiring high concentration, such as exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Potential Side Effects and Recommendations
While beneficial for wakefulness, excessive caffeine intake can lead to adverse effects:
*   **[[Drug interactions and toxicities|Caffeine toxicity]]**: Consuming more than three strong cups of tea or coffee a day can result in [[Drug interactions and toxicities|caffeine toxicity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Symptoms include anxiety, panic, restlessness, and headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Sleep Hygiene**: For individuals sensitive to its effects on sleep, it is recommended to avoid consuming tea or coffee after 4:00-4:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This practice is considered a good [[Effective notetaking and study techniques|sleep hygiene]] measure to ensure undisturbed night sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

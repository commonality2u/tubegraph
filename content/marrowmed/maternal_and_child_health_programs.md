Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and [[mother_and_child_health_programs_and_family_planning | Family Planning]] topics were highly significant in the NEET PG 2024 exam, accounting for two to three multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in session one and three to four MCQs in session two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Key Areas and Concepts

Several key concepts related to MCH were tested, including Maternal Mortality Rate/Ratio, steps for immediate newborn care, and specific details about [[drug_management_in_obstetrics | drug management]] in pregnancy and care for infants.

### Maternal Mortality

Questions on Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and its formula were included in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**: Calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births, multiplied by 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Maternal Mortality Rate**: Calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total number of females in the reproductive group, multiplied by 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Definition of Maternal Mortality**: Refers to any female death due to pregnancy or related causes within 42 days of delivery or termination of pregnancy. This includes deaths from abortion and ectopic pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. However, it does **not** include deaths due to accidents, trauma, or electrocution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

### Immediate Newborn Care

The steps for immediate newborn care were also a topic of examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
The "ABCDE" mnemonic outlines key aspects of early newborn care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>:
*   **A** stands for Apgar scoring and airway maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **B** stands for body temperature maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   Bathing should be delayed for at least 24 hours due to the significant risk of hypothermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **C** stands for continuous care and cord care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **D** stands for skin care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **E** stands for eye care, which involves wiping eyes from inside to outside with normal water or saline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

### Intrauterine Device (IUD) Insertion

The earliest time for IUD insertion after a normal vaginal delivery was tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   IUDs can be inserted within 10 minutes post-placental or within 48 hours postpartum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   After 48 hours, insertion should be delayed until after 6 weeks postpartum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

### [[Medical Termination of Pregnancy MTP Act 2021 | Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act 2021]]

The [[medical_termination_of_pregnancy_mtp_act_2021 | MTP Act 2021]] was a focus, especially regarding specific scenarios like rape or sexual assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Up to 20 weeks of gestation**: Requires approval from one registered medical practitioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Between 20 to 24 weeks of gestation**: Requires approval from two registered medical practitioners. This is permissible for specific categories of females, including survivors of sexual assault or rape, minors, those with a change in marital status during pregnancy, females with major disabilities, or cases of fetal malformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **After 24 weeks of gestation**: Requires approval from a medical board and is only permissible in cases of fetal anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   MTP cannot be done irrespective of the time of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

### Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)

The full form and purpose of JSSK (Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram) were questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **JSSK** stands for Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   It ensures everything is free for pregnant females, including OPD, IPD treatment, and transport. The aim is to decrease out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

### School Health Programs

Under [[national_health_programs_and_disease_prevention | National Health Programs and Disease Prevention]] like Ayushman Bharat, school health programs involve several components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.
*   **Health Screening**: Performed for four 'D' conditions: diseases, deficiencies, defects, and developmental delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   **Deworming**: Massively undertaken for school-going children as part of programs like [[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | Anemia Mukt Bharat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
    *   Children 1-2 years receive 200 mg Albendazole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.
    *   Children over 2 years receive 400 mg Albendazole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.
*   **Sanitary Napkins**: Provided for adolescent girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Iron Folic Acid (IFA) Supplements**: Provided weekly, not monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
    *   Younger children (under 10 years) receive tablets with 45 mg elemental iron and 400 mcg folic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
    *   Adults and older children receive tablets with 60 mg elemental iron and 500 mcg folic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.
    *   These are known as Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplements (WIFS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

### Early Neonatal Mortality Rate (ENMR)

*   **Calculation**: Deaths of children aged less than 7 days divided by live births, multiplied by 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
*   *Example:* For 9 deaths of children aged less than 7 days out of 500 live births, the ENMR is 18 per 1,000 live births (9/500 * 1000 = 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

### Demographic Stages

Demographic stages or cycles are frequently asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
The five demographic stages are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>:
1.  High Stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>
2.  Early Expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>
3.  Late Expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>
4.  Low Stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>
5.  Declining Phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>

The stages involve a balance between birth rate and death rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. For example, line B in a demographic cycle graph typically represents the death rate, while line A represents the birth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Longevity Dividend

The concept of "longevity dividend" is related to "demographic dividend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.
*   **Demographic Dividend**: Refers to a higher number of economically productive population, often resulting from high birth rates in previous demographic stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.
*   **Longevity Dividend**: The benefit of increased lifespan (longevity) for a country, often due to better economic conditions stemming from a demographic dividend. This leads to economic and health benefits for society, as people live longer and can contribute more through experience and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

### Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)

The components of PQLI are an important indicator.
*   **PQLI** includes three parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>:
    1.  Life Expectancy at 1 year (L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>
    2.  Literacy Rate (knowledge rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>
    3.  Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>
*   It **does not** include income or per capita gross national product, which are part of the Human Development Index (HDI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

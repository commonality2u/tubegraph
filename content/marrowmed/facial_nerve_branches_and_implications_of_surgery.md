The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland, specifically within its substance at the *pes anserinus* plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>. This anatomical relationship makes the facial nerve particularly vulnerable during [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | parotid surgery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

## Facial Nerve Branches and their Functions

Upon entering the parotid gland, the facial nerve typically divides into two main divisions: the temporofacial and cervicofacial divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. These divisions then give rise to five main branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>:

*   **Temporal Branch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>
    *   **Function:** Primarily supplies the frontalis muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>, which is responsible for raising the eyebrows and wrinkling the forehead (e.g., in an expression of surprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. It also supplies the upper part of the orbicularis oculi muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **Zygomatic Branch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>
    *   **Function:** Mainly supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>, which is crucial for eye closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.
*   **Buccal Branch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>
    *   **Function:** Supplies the buccinator muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a> and various upper lip muscles, including levator labii superioris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and zygomaticus major and minor muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **Marginal Mandibular Branch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>
    *   **Function:** Supplies the lower lip muscles, such as depressor anguli oris, depressor labii inferioris, and mentalis muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Cervical Branch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>
    *   **Function:** Supplies the platysma muscle in the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

## Clinical Implications of Parotid Surgery

Due to the facial nerve's intricate course through the parotid gland, [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | parotid surgery]] carries a risk of nerve injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. The specific symptoms of nerve damage depend on which branch is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

For instance, if a patient complains of lower lip muscle weakness after parotid surgery, this is most likely due to an injury to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. Other potential deficits include:

*   **Difficulty raising eyebrows or wrinkling the forehead** if the temporal branch is injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Difficulty closing the eye** if the zygomatic branch is injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
*   **Upper lip muscle weakness** if the buccal branch is injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.

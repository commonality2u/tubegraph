Dr. Vinit, who achieved an excellent rank of seven in the INI set exam, shares his [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | strategies]] and [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques]] for success in competitive medical exams. His [[personal_experiences_and_tips_for_medical_exam_success | personal experiences]] highlight the [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | importance of consistent revision]] and strategic preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Early Preparation & Resource Utilization
Dr. Vinit began his preparation with Maro during his second year of medical college, initially reading standard books before transitioning to the Maro platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While he generally preferred reading notes over watching videos, he found specific videos, like Dr. Rohan Kandwal's surgery videos and Dr. Mayur Kulkarni's radiology videos, to be highly beneficial due to their animations and concept explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. He noted that concept clarity, fostered by these videos, was crucial for cracking tricky questions in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## QBank Approach
Dr. Vinit primarily utilized the Maro QBank during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. His key strategies included:
*   **Daily MCQ Target**: He and his friends set a target of solving 100 MCQs every day, even when on call, which significantly helped in completing most of the QBank (over 80%) within a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Peer Motivation**: This group approach helped push each other to meet their daily targets, which he found essential for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Explanation Review**: He emphasizes that Maro's QBank has top-notch explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy
Dr. Vinit started taking grand tests around June of his internship year, committing to one GT every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Don't Wait for Perfection**: He notes that there isn't an "ideal time" to start taking GTs, as he hadn't completed all subjects before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Even with some minor subjects untouched and first/second-year subjects not yet revised, GTs still provided significant help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **In-depth Analysis**: After each test, he would spend a substantial amount of time reviewing the answers, reading every explanation from "top to bottom, left to right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. He would dedicate about two hours to review 50 questions, ensuring thorough understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Topic Expansion**: If a GT asked about a specific topic (e.g., a parasite's egg), he would then proactively read about all related topics and use flashcards for continuous [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on Weaknesses**: It's crucial to spend time after the test analyzing mistakes and working on weaknesses to strengthen them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Notes & Revision
Dr. Vinit used Maro's notes extensively, opting not to create his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Maro Edition Notes**: He used the Maro Edition Six notes for his MBBS exams during final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Revision Notes**: Closer to the exam, he utilized the Maro revision notes, finding them effective for covering a vast range of topics concisely, including many he hadn't studied before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He primarily relied on these notes for [[study and revision techniques for medical exams | revision]], rather than revision videos, during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Final Revision Days
In the last 15 days before the exam, Dr. Vinit focused on maximizing his [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Subject Focus**: He left high-yield, factual subjects like Anatomy and Biochemistry for the very end, to keep them fresh in his mind for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This strategy provides a competitive edge when dealing with tricky, factual questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Continuous Engagement**: He continued using flashcards and reading as much as possible, even if he couldn't cover all subjects in the final 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Exam Day Strategy
For competitive exams, Dr. Vinit advises:
*   **Stay Calm**: Maintaining composure during the exam is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Elimination Technique**: Focus on understanding why wrong answers are wrong, rather than solely knowing the correct answer. Each option provides a hint, and eliminating incorrect choices can lead to the right answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
Dr. Vinit emphasizes that success in these exams comes from hard work and consistent effort. He attributes his achievement to his dedication and thorough [[strategies for preparing for competitive medical exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. He advises future candidates to:
*   Prioritize [[importance of consistent revision for medical exams | revision]], aiming to complete all subjects at least once before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   Focus on weaknesses to get stronger and perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   Avoid tying self-worth to exam ranks, as luck can play a part in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

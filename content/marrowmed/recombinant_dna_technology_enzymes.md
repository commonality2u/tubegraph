Enzymes play a crucial role in recombinant DNA technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. The latest editions of biochemistry textbooks like Harper's often include updated lists of these enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. This topic is considered a [[high_yield_topics_in_biochemistry_for_inicet | high yield topic]] for various exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

Key enzymes used in recombinant DNA technology include:

## Phosphatase
Phosphatase is an enzyme used to remove the 5' phosphate group from DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This removal allows for the addition of a radiolabeled phosphate group for labeling purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Terminal Transferase
Terminal transferase is utilized when restriction endonucleases cut double-stranded DNA, often creating blunt ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This enzyme is used for "homopolymer tailing," which involves adding a few extra nucleotides to these blunt ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## CRISPR-Cas9
CRISPR-Cas9 was a new addition to the list of enzymes in the latest edition of Harper's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-targeted DNA endonuclease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, meaning it can cut DNA from within, similar to a restriction endonuclease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The system includes a guide RNA that directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific double-stranded DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Applications**: It is primarily used for genome editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Beyond research and diagnostics, CRISPR-Cas9 has therapeutic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. It can treat various disorders, such as sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. For example, drugs like Casgevy are CRISPR-Cas9 based therapeutics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

The TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification system is a standard for cancer staging, particularly relevant in surgery for assessing the extent of the disease and guiding treatment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Breast Cancer Staging

[[tnm_staging_for_breast_cancer | Breast cancer staging]] is a frequently tested topic in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Key aspects of breast cancer TNM staging include:

### T (Tumor) Classification
*   **TIS (Carcinoma In Situ)**: Refers to carcinoma in situ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS) is no longer considered an in situ lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) or Paget's disease are part of TIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **T1**: Tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **T2**: Tumor size between 2 cm and 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **T3**: Tumor size more than 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **T4**: Most exam questions are centered around T4 classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   **T4A**: Involvement of the chest wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Pectoralis major or pectoralis muscle involvement is *not* considered chest wall involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Chest wall involvement includes serratus anterior, intercostal muscles, and ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   **T4B**: Skin involvement, which includes *peau d'orange*, satellite nodules, and ulceration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   **T4C**: Represents a combination of T4A and T4B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   **T4D (Inflammatory Breast Cancer)**: Occurs when *peau d'orange* affects more than one-third of the breast skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. *Peau d'orange* is due to involvement of the subdermal lymphatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### N (Nodal) Staging
*   **N0**: No nodal involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **N1**: Mobile axillary nodes are positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **N2**:
    *   **N2A**: Fixed axillary nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **N2B**: Positive internal mammary lymph nodes with negative axillary nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **N3**:
    *   **N3A**: Infraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **N3B**: Positive internal mammary and axillary lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   **N3C**: Supraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### M (Metastasis) Classification
*   **M0**: No distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **M1**: Presence of distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Colonic Cancer Staging

Understanding the stage of colonic cancer is important for management.
*   **Stage Zero**: Intramucosal carcinoma, where the tumor is only in the mucosal layer with no evidence of invasion and no lymph node involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   **Stage One**: Tumor is in the submucosa or the muscle layer, but there is no lymph node or distant spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.
*   **Stage Two**: Involves the serosa or adjacent structures, but lymph nodes are not involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   **Stage Three**: Involves lymph node involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
*   **Stage Four**: Denotes distant spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.

Dr. Manoj Gowda, an MBBS graduate from SSR Medical College in Mauritius, achieved an exceptional score of 256 on his first attempt at the January 12th FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His success highlights the importance of strategic planning and consistent effort, particularly when navigating the challenges of [[balancing_medical_school_studies_with_exam_preparation | medical studies]] in an international setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Dr. Manoj's Background and Preparation Philosophy

Dr. Gowda subscribed to Marrow, his primary source of preparation, during his third year of MBBS, opting for a two-year subscription and printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. He extended his subscription to prepare for PG exams, demonstrating his long-term commitment to a single, trusted resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

He acknowledged the common challenge faced by students abroad: the difficulty of [[balancing_academics_and_personal_life_in_medicine | balancing college curriculum]] with competitive exam preparation, especially when living away from family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Balancing Studies

Dr. Manoj's core strategy for [[managing_time_and_resources_during_medical_education | managing time and resources]] and [[balancing_medical_school_studies_with_exam_preparation | balancing his medical studies]] was rooted in subject-wise focus and a phased approach:

### Third Year Focus
In his third year, Dr. Manoj decided to thoroughly complete his third-year subjects (ENT, Ophthalmology, Community Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. His approach involved:
*   Watching all Marrow videos for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Watching MCQ discussion videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Solving all associated Q-banks (initially focusing on NEET PG Q-bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Solving the last 10 years of NEET PG, INICET, and FMG exam questions for these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Simultaneously reading printed notes while watching videos, and then attempting MCQs for the same topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   He spent about one month on ENT, allocating more time to Ophthalmology and Community Medicine (two-thirds of the time for Community Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Final Year Focus
For his final year, Dr. Manoj focused on the four major subjects: OBG, Medicine, Surgery, and Pediatrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He watched nearly all main videos for Medicine, except for the Endocrinology part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. By the time he returned to India, he was confident with his notes and MCQs for third and final year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He also solved 650 modules in his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> and gave subject-wise tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Post-University Focus
Upon returning to India six months before the FMG exam, Dr. Manoj concentrated solely on first and second-year subjects (pre-clinical and para-clinical), which he had not touched during his MBBS years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He recognized these as his weaker areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He spent about one and a half to two months on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. For biochemistry, he accepted it as a weaker area and focused mainly on PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

For "short subjects" like Skin, Anesthesia, Radiology, and Psychiatry, he relied on Marrow's 6.5 edition revision notes, reading them thoroughly to answer 70-80% of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
Dr. Manoj completed three full readings before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. During revision, he primarily used revision notes, but for Surgery, OBG, and Community Medicine, he kept his main notes alongside to annotate any new or important points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Motivation
He started giving GTs early, on August 1st, after beginning his preparation in mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. His first GT score was 231 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He initially planned monthly GTs, then fortnightly, but eventually prioritized completing the syllabus due to his high scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. He reviewed every question of his first five GTs, even correct ones, to understand explanations and alternative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He spread the review over several days (30-40 questions per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

When demotivated, his parents provided constant support, reminding him that 150 was the passing mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. He also relied on a friend, Shambhavi, who had already cleared the exam, for advice on GT frequency and review strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Advice

*   **Consistent Preparation from Undergrad:** Dr. Manoj emphasized the importance of building concepts from the beginning of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Focusing on third and final-year subjects during MBBS and then tackling first and second-year subjects later proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Target Passing Marks First:** His advice to students is to first aim for the passing mark of 150 to be in the "green zone" before chasing higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Weaker Areas:** It's crucial to identify and work on weaker subjects before the exam, rather than over-relying on strong areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Stick to One Source:** Dr. Manoj strictly relied on Marrow as his sole source of preparation, avoiding other YouTube videos or MCQ discussions, which helped him focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This highlights the importance of believing in and maximizing a chosen platform.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** The FMG exam is evolving, requiring conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization or one-liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Concepts are built through consistent study from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Utilize Revision Notes Effectively:** For revision, thoroughly reading every word of the revision notes is key, as answers are often subtly embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Review GTs Strategically:** Reviewing every GT question, even correct ones, and spreading the review over multiple days can enhance understanding and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

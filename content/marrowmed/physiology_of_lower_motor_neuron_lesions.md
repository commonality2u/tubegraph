Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) lesions are associated with specific physiological findings predominantly affecting [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy|skeletal muscle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Lower motor neurons, including alpha and gamma motor neurons, directly [[muscle_and_nerve_innervation_in_limbs|innervate skeletal muscles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of LMN Lesions

When there is a lesion in a lower motor neuron, the following findings are typically observed in the affected muscles:

*   **Fasciculations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>: Involuntary twitching of muscle fibers visible under the skin. These are highly classical of LMN lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Atrophy of the muscle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>: A decrease in muscle mass. Atrophy is directly related to fasciculations and is seen in LMN lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Hypotonia / Decreased Muscle Tone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>: A reduction in the resting tension of a muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Hypoactive or Absent Reflexes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>: A diminution or complete loss of deep tendon reflexes.
*   **Negative Babinski Sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>: When the sole of the foot is stimulated, the great toe should plantiflex (bend downwards) normally. In LMN lesions, the Babinski sign is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Segmental Weakness/Paralysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>: Weakness or paralysis affects specific muscles or groups of muscles corresponding to the affected spinal segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Differentiation from Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) Lesions

It is crucial to distinguish LMN lesions from Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) lesions, as they present with contrasting clinical findings:

| Feature                   | Lower Motor Neuron Lesion                                 | Upper Motor Neuron Lesion                                        |

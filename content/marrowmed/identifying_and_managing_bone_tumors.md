Orthopedics recall questions from INIET May 2025 examinations included questions on bone tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These topics are considered standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Common Types and Radiological Features

Bone tumors often present with symptoms like leg pain and difficulty walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Characteristic radiological findings on X-rays can suggest a diagnosis:

*   **Osteosarcoma**: Commonly associated with a "sunburst" or "sunray" appearance and Codman's triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Ewing Sarcoma**: Can also exhibit a "sunray" or "sunburst" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Periosteal Reactions**: Findings like "onion peel" appearance, which usually occurs in Ewing sarcoma, and "sunray" or "sunburst" appearance, usually in osteosarcoma, are non-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Codman's Triangle

This sign appears when a tumor grows aggressively and rapidly, elevating the periosteum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Bone formation or calcification occurs at the edges of the periosteum, creating the triangular appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Sunray and sunburst appearance results from the calcification of Sharpie's fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Diagnostic Considerations

While radiological appearance is helpful, it is not always definitive as periosteal reactions are non-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Other factors are more important in making a definitive diagnosis:

*   **Age of the patient** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>
*   **Bone involved and its location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   **Biopsy findings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>:
    *   For Ewing Sarcoma, specific biopsy findings include CD99 positivity, Mik2 gene mutation, small round blue cells with pseudo rosettes, and translocation 11;22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[diagnosing_and_managing_bone_infections | Chronic osteomyelitis]], a bone infection, can also cause a "thick or solid periosteal reaction" known as involucrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between infectious and neoplastic processes.

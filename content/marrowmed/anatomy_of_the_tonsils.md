The tonsils develop from the second pharyngeal pouch, with the remnant of this pouch within the tonsil being the largest crypt, known as Krypto Magna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Tonsils are present at birth and reach their maximum size by puberty (around 12 years of age), after which they begin to atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Structure

The tonsil is covered on its outside by an epithelial lining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This lining in the oropharynx is stratified squamous and non-keratinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Laterally, the tonsil is encased by a capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, which is formed by the pharyngobasilar fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Bed of Tonsil and Surrounding Spaces
The area lateral to the tonsil capsule is known as the bed of the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Peritonsillar Space**: Immediately lateral to the tonsil capsule is the peritonsillar space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The absence of this space can lead to quinsy or peritonsillar abscess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This space contains the paratonsillar vein (also known as the external palatine vein), which is responsible for draining the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This vein is the most common source of hemorrhage following [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Superior Constrictor Muscle**: Lateral to the peritonsillar space is the superior constrictor muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Parapharyngeal Space**: Further lateral is the parapharyngeal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, which is divided into two compartments by the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | styloid process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The [[tongue_anatomy_and_papillae | styloglossus muscle]] is attached to the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | styloid process]] and is an important muscle in the bed of the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Blood Supply
The arterial supply to the tonsil originates entirely from branches of the [[anatomy_and_branching_patterns_of_carotid_arteries | external carotid artery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These branches include:
*   Tonsillar branches from the lingual artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Branches from the facial artery, which is considered the main artery supplying the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Its two branches supplying the tonsil are the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending palatine artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Branches from the ascending pharyngeal artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   The descending palatine artery, a branch of the maxillary artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Most arteries enter the tonsil through its lower pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. During [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]], proper ligation of the lower pole is crucial to prevent hemorrhage, which is the most common complication of the procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Lymphatic Drainage
The lymphatic drainage of the tonsil goes to the upper deep cervical lymph nodes, also known as the tonsillar node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Tonsil Infections and Their Types
[[tonsil_infections_and_their_types | Tonsil infections]] can be viral or bacterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If bacterial, the most common organism is Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. [[tonsil_infections_and_their_types | Tonsil infections]] typically present in four types:
1.  **Cattarhal Type**: Characterized by diffuse involvement of the tonsil along with the rest of the pharynx, known as acute catarrhal tonsillitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  **Follicular Variant**: Presents with pus or exudates in the crypts of the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
3.  **Membranous/Pseudomembranous Variant**: Occurs when pus from the crypts fuses to form a pseudomembrane over the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
4.  **Parenchymatous Tonsillitis**: Results from infection extending into the tonsil's parenchyma, leading to chronic, massive enlargement of the tonsils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Patients with this variant often experience obstructive features like sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Differential Diagnoses of Membranous Tonsillitis
When a patient presents with a membrane over the tonsil and does not respond to antibiotics against Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, other conditions to consider include:
*   **Vincent's Angina (Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis)**: Also known as trench mouth, caused by *Borrelia vincentii* and *Fusobacterium* (an anaerobe), requiring anaerobic antibiotic cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Infectious Mononucleosis (IM)**: A viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Patients often have bilateral lymphadenopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Diagnosis is made by the Paul-Bunnell test or Monospot test (detecting heterophile antibodies) and atypical lymphocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Diphtheria**: Suspected in patients with no immunization history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The tonsillar membrane is typically dirty gray, extends beyond the tonsil, and bleeds when removed due to its tight adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy showing club-shaped gram-positive rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Treatment involves immediate antitoxin administration (after sensitivity testing), which targets the exotoxin released by the bacteria, and antibiotics like beta-lactams or macrolides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Diphtheria can be fatal due to respiratory obstruction (from membrane dislodgment) or late complications affecting the heart (myocarditis, arrhythmias) and nerves (peripheral neuritis leading to palatal palsy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## [[indications_for_tonsilectomy | Indications for Tonsillectomy]]
While most cases of tonsillitis are treated with antibiotics, [[indications_for_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is considered in certain situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>:
*   **Infectious Indications**:
    *   Recurrent episodes of tonsillitis: more than 3 per year for 3 consecutive years, more than 5 per year for 2 consecutive years, or more than 7 in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Infectious Indications**:
    *   Hugely enlarged tonsils causing obstructive symptoms like sleep apnea, typically seen in the parenchymatous variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | Tonsillectomy Procedures]]
### Patient Positioning
For [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]], the patient is typically placed in Rose's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This involves extension at both the cervicothoracic and atlanto-occipital joints, but not hyperextension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This position is also used for adenoidectomy and tracheostomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Methods
[[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | Tonsillectomy]] methods can be categorized as:
*   **Cold Method**: Does not involve heat production. Common techniques include dissection and snare method, and microdebrider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Hot Method**: Involves heat production. The most common hot method is coblation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Coblation (cold ablation) produces less heat compared to cautery or laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Types of Tonsillectomy
*   **Extracapsular Tonsillectomy**: The entire tonsil along with its capsule is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This is typically performed for infectious indications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Intracapsular Tonsillectomy**: Only a part of the tonsil causing obstruction is removed, leaving some tonsillar tissue behind to preserve immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This is often done for tonsils enlarged due to obstructive symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[management_of_hemorrhage_following_tonsilectomy | Complications of Tonsillectomy]]
The most common complication following [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This bleeding is typically venous, originating from the paratonsillar vein (external palatine vein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Types of hemorrhage:
*   **Primary Hemorrhage**: Occurs during the surgical procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Reactionary Hemorrhage**: Occurs in the recovery room or within 24 hours post-surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Causes include slippage of ligatures or dislodgment of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Occurs any time from 24 hours up to 10 days post-surgery, most commonly around 5 to 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It is secondary to infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### [[management_of_hemorrhage_following_tonsilectomy | Management of Hemorrhage]]
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: First step is to administer intravenous antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Primary or Reactionary Hemorrhage**:
    1.  Immediately take the patient back to the operating theatre (if reactionary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    2.  Remove any clots to allow proper clipping action of the superior constrictor muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    3.  Apply pressure with a vasoconstrictor gauze or pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    4.  Cauterize the bleeding blood vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    5.  Ligate the vessel if bleeding persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

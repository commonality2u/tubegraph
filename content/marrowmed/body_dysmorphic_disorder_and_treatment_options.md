Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), also known as Dysmorphophobia, is a condition characterized by a constant preoccupation or obsession with perceived flaws in one's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:31">[02:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:47">[02:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Individuals with BDD often report blemishes, spots, or other perceived imperfections on their face or body that are not actually visible to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:49">[02:00:49]</a>. They may express feelings of being "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>.

Common behaviors associated with BDD include:
*   Constantly checking their appearance in mirrors, the back of spoons, or windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>.
*   Repeatedly seeking cosmetic procedures, such as full facial reconstruction from plastic surgeons, even when multiple professionals assure them no issues are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.
*   Despite reassurance from family members, they remain worried about their perceived flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>.

### Insight and Delusions
Patients with BDD can present with varying levels of insight:
*   **Ideas (Doubts):** They may express doubts about perceived flaws, such as "maybe my face is having these lesions," or "maybe my ears are bigger," or "maybe the nose is crooked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:41">[02:22:41]</a>.
*   **Delusions (False Fixed Beliefs):** In some cases, the preoccupation can progress to a delusional level, where individuals hold false fixed beliefs about their appearance and are unable to accept that others do not see the problem, even when told otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>.

## Treatment
The primary treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder is Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. This approach is consistent with other conditions involving constant preoccupation or obsession, such as:
*   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:16">[02:24:16]</a>
*   Hoarding Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:18">[02:24:18]</a>
*   Illness Anxiety Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>

Even if patients with BDD exhibit very poor insight or thinking at a delusional level, SSRIs remain the first choice for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. While atypical antipsychotics can be added at small dosages in some cases, SSRIs are considered the primary treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:47">[02:24:47]</a>. It has been observed that SSRIs can lead to a reduction in preoccupation and a gradual breaking of the delusional quality in these patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:36">[02:24:36]</a>.

Developing strong problem-solving skills, including effective guessing and cross-subject thinking, is crucial for success in competitive medical exams like NEET-PG and INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach emphasizes starting practice early and not waiting for syllabus completion.

## The Impracticality of Syllabus Completion

Many students believe they should start [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | giving GTs]] only after completing their syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, the syllabus for these exams is vast and can never be fully completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Even experienced individuals confidently state their syllabus is never truly finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Waiting to complete the syllabus before engaging in practice is an unrealistic and unhelpful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Benefits of Early Grand Test (GT) Practice

Starting [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | GTs]] early provides a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It takes approximately 5 to 10 [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | Grand Tests]] just to understand the dynamics and [[problemsolving_strategies_in_exams | game of solving GTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. After this initial phase, you can then focus on [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | improving your score]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Cultivating Guessing Power

In exams like INICET, it's unrealistic to expect to know the answer to every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If you believe you know every question, you might be approaching your preparation incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Starting [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | GTs]] early, even with an incomplete understanding of some subjects, helps in developing a good "guessing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This skill involves thinking differently to arrive at the correct option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Fostering Cross-Subject Thinking

Early and consistent [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | GT practice]] also encourages cross-subject thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This involves using knowledge from other subjects to fill in gaps or deduce answers for questions in a different subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This integrated approach to problem-solving is invaluable for complex medical examination questions.

### Conclusion

It is highly recommended to [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | give GTs]] as early as possible and not delay until syllabus completion, as that milestone is unlikely to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Early practice with [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | Grand Tests]] is key to developing essential exam-taking skills like strategic guessing and cross-subject application of knowledge.

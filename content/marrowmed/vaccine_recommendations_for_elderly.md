Vaccine recommendations for the elderly population, specifically those over 65 years of age, often differ based on regional guidelines, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. The MOHFW has adopted CDC guidelines, integrating them into their adult vaccination protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Recommended Vaccines for Individuals Over 65 Years

For adults aged 65 years and above, certain vaccines are strongly recommended:
*   **COVID-19 Vaccine** Individuals in this age group should receive the COVID-19 vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Influenza Vaccine** The influenza vaccine is recommended for all people aged over 65 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. An eggless variant of the influenza vaccine is also available for those with egg allergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Pneumococcal Vaccine** Both PCV and ppv23 pneumococcal vaccines are given to individuals over 65 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Optional Vaccines for Individuals Over 65 Years (in India)

Some vaccines are considered optional or are given only in specific situations in the Indian subcontinent:
*   **Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Vaccine** While recommended by the CDC, the Government of India considers the shingles vaccine optional for adult immunization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   **Hepatitis, Meningococcal, Hib, and Monkeypox Vaccines** These vaccines are generally not required unless there are specific situations or risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Vaccines Not Recommended/Applicable for Individuals Over 65 Years

*   **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine** The HPV vaccine is not a part of adult immunization recommendations for those over 65 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Its approval typically covers ages 19 to 40-45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine** As per the MOHFW adult vaccination protocol, the RSV vaccine is not currently used in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Globally, it might be given to people aged 75 and above, but it's not part of the standard Indian recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

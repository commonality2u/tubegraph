Dr. Pushwand, who achieved Rank 9 in the NEETPG exam, emphasizes that balancing academic rigor with personal well-being and social life is crucial for a sustainable and successful medical education journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51"></a>. His approach involved integrating learning with clinical experiences and actively engaging in hobbies and social activities.

## Approach to Academics

Dr. Pushwand's academic strategy focused on flexible and integrated learning:
*   **Video Usage** Instead of sitting through "marathon" sessions, he utilized Marrow videos to address specific topics or cases discussed in classes or seen with patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22"></a>. This allowed for clinical relevance and application, rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56"></a>.
*   **Notes and Revision** He preferred using handwritten notes, which he annotated himself and further updated from a friend's annotated notes for a concise and crisp revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36"></a>.
*   **MCQ Practice** He started practicing MCQs only after grasping core concepts, initially targeting 50 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23"></a>. He used custom modules, viewing them as "mini-GTs" to get a quick assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40"></a>.
    *   He also stressed the importance of updating bookmarks for MCQs, removing questions he had already mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07"></a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)** Dr. Pushwand gradually increased the frequency of GTs, starting with once every two weeks and later weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57"></a>. However, he stopped giving GTs in the last 10 days before the main exam to protect his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22"></a>.
    *   For reviewing GTs, he found it essential to focus on questions marked as "guessed correct" or "wrong" using the 'guess marker' feature, rather than reviewing the entire test, which he found time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14"></a>.
*   **Time Management During Exams** He maintained a consistent pace in mock exams, aiming for approximately seven minutes per section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46"></a>. He also advised treating GTs as real exams, without distractions like phones or internet browsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02"></a>. For lengthy questions, he would read the last line and options first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41"></a>.

## Pursuing Personal Interests and Wellbeing

Dr. Pushwand emphasized the importance of engaging in activities beyond academics to ensure a holistic medical school experience:
*   **Social Interaction** He valued "gossip groups" for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09"></a> and cherished late-night conversations with close friends at coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55"></a>.
*   **Sports and Fitness** Despite not being initially good at sports, he took up badminton with friends, went swimming, and developed a strong passion for gymming in his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22"></a>. These activities helped him manage stress and maintain physical health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40"></a>.
*   **College Experience** A significant reason for pursuing medicine in AIIMS was to ensure he didn't "miss college" and could experience a vibrant university life beyond just studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01"></a>.

His journey underscores the importance of a balanced approach, where academic strategies are complemented by a fulfilling personal life to navigate the demands of medical education.

Dr. Vinit, who achieved rank seven in the INI CET exam, emphasizes the crucial [[importance_of_question_banks_and_test_series | role of question banks]] in his preparation, stating he was "a Q bank guy all throughout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. His approach highlights key strategies for [[utilizing_digital_tools_and_q_banks_for_exam_preparation | effectively using Q banks]] to achieve success.

## Early Adoption and Consistent Use
Dr. Vinit began using the Marrow platform for studying in his late second year of medical school, initially watching videos for specific subjects like ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. However, during his internship, he focused predominantly on notes and the Qbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

He started solving the Qbank extensively during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>, completing over 80% of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. This consistent engagement with practice questions was a cornerstone of his study regimen.

## Strategic Approach to Question Banks
Dr. Vinit and his friends adopted a structured approach to [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | using the Qbank]]:
*   **Daily Targets** They aimed to solve "100 MCQs every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This discipline was maintained even during challenging times, such as when on call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   **Peer Motivation** Studying in a group, they motivated and pushed each other to meet their daily targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Dr. Vinit states that this mutual encouragement was essential: "It wouldn't be possible otherwise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Thorough Review of Explanations** A critical aspect of his strategy was reviewing *every* question's explanation, not just those he answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. He would spend significant time analyzing each Grand Test (GT), dedicating approximately "two hours to do 50 questions" by thoroughly reading the explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

> "It's not just important to give these grand tests that Maro offers you, but it's also equally important to spend time on that test after that test is over. Going through the explanations, going through realizing where you have gone wrong and then working more on your weaknesses so that you can get them strong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>

## Benefits and Competitive Edge
The extensive use of the Qbank, coupled with diligent review, provided several benefits:
*   **Conceptual Clarity** Dr. Vinit found that the Qbank helped in developing the "knack" to crack tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This was particularly important for the INI CET exam, which focused less on "factual topics" and more on "understanding what they're trying to ask and you know ruling out options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Weakness Identification** [[Effective use of question banks and mock tests | Analyzing test results]] and explanations allowed him to identify and work on his weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, which is crucial for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
*   **High-Yield Topic Identification** By reviewing explanations from grand tests, he would identify high-yield topics and read further on them, even creating flashcards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This allowed him to cover subjects he hadn't formally studied yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage** Dr. Vinit asserts that Marrow offers "the best question bank and the best grand test in the business," with "topnotch" explanations that provide a significant competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

**Advice for Future Examinees**
Dr. Vinit advises students preparing for upcoming exams like NEET PG to focus on revision, aim to complete all subjects, and maintain calmness during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. He stresses the importance of figuring out "why the wrong answer is wrong" as a way to eliminate options and arrive at the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm *Taenia solium* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. It is a significant cause of neurological issues, particularly in endemic regions.

## Clinical Presentation
Patients with neurocysticercosis commonly present with headache and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. There may or may not be fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, and there is typically no history of pulmonary tuberculosis infection or signs of meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Imaging Findings
The characteristic imaging finding of neurocysticercosis on CT or MRI is a [[ring_enhancing_lesions_in_the_brain_and_their_differential_diagnosis | ring enhancing lesion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> with a specific feature:
*   **Eccentric Dot Sign / Cyst with a Dot Sign**: A peculiar feature is an eccentric dot visible within the [[ring_enhancing_lesions_in_the_brain_and_their_differential_diagnosis | ring enhancing lesion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This eccentric dot represents the scolex of the parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The presence of this dot helps in clinching the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, and it is also known as the "cyst with a dot sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Escobar Staging of Neurocysticercosis
Neurocysticercosis is classified into four stages based on the host's immune response to the parasite:

1.  **Vesicular Stage (Acute Stage)**:
    *   This is the initial stage where the cyst has recently formed in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
    *   There is no edema, no inflammation, and no enhancement around the cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The body has not yet reacted to the parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

2.  **Colloidal Vesicular Stage (Early Subacute Stage)**:
    *   As the parasite degenerates, parasitic antigens diffuse into the brain parenchyma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
    *   The body reacts strongly to these foreign antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
    *   This stage is characterized by maximum edema, inflammation, and enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

3.  **Granular Nodular Stage (Late Subacute Stage)**:
    *   As the immune response continues, there is a decreasing trend of edema, inflammation, and enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

4.  **Nodular Calcified Stage (Chronic Stage)**:
    *   The parasite is ultimately killed and phagocytosed, and its antigens are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   What remains at the site is a tiny calcified parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
    *   This stage again shows no edema, inflammation, or contrast enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### Myiocysticercosis
Cysticercosis can also affect muscles, a condition known as myiocysticercosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. In this form, the cysticercosis granulomas within the muscle become calcified, giving rise to elongated calcifications visible on X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This appearance is termed "rice grain calcification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

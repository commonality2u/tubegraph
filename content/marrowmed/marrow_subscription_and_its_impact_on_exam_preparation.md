From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

Dr. Dian, who achieved an impressive Rank 4 in the May INI CET exam, shared insights into his preparation journey and how he leveraged [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] to achieve this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His approach demonstrates the comprehensive utility of [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] as a study resource.

## Initial [[Role of Marrow in exam preparation | Role of Marrow in Exam Preparation]]

Dr. Dian initially purchased a [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] subscription at the end of his first year, or beginning of his second year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His initial goal was not specifically to ace an entrance exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Instead, he wanted to gain a solid understanding of subjects for that academic year, especially as clinical postings were beginning in his second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His aim was to grasp terminologies and basic knowledge of different subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He took a more focused approach towards entrance exams in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow Video Lectures]] and Their Effectiveness

[[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow videos]] are known for their depth, simplicity, and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Dr. Dian started watching videos for second-year subjects like Pathology, Pharmacology, and Microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

A key benefit was their ability to break down difficult terminologies and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He used videos as a foundational step before consulting textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This approach made understanding and absorbing knowledge from textbooks much easier later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Specific Example: Orthopedics
Dr. Dian recalled an instance during his Orthopedics posting where he struggled to answer a basic question about managing a fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. After this, he watched [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | Marrow videos]] on the basics of fracture healing, which clarified terms like traction, displacement, reduction, open reduction, and closed reduction (ORIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This foundational understanding from the videos made subsequent learning easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | Marrow Question Bank]] (QBank)

While Dr. Dian didn't use the [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams | Marrow Question Bank]] extensively in his early years, he found it to be a "game changer" during his final year preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The QBank was crucial, especially given the statement-based questions in the INI CET exam, which required in-depth knowledge of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

He maintained a small diary to note down extra information from the QBank that might not have been covered in the videos but was important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A significant advantage of the [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams | Marrow QBank]] was its references from standard textbooks, ensuring accuracy and reliability of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This rigorous cross-referencing helps ensure the most updated and accurate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Grand Tests and Test Series

Dr. Dian utilized Marrow's grand tests more than any other resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Initially, in his third and final year, he focused on acclimatizing himself to the format of answering 200 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. His early goal was to get a "hang of the thing" and test his guessing abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

During his internship, he started taking grand tests more regularly and always aimed to take them when they were live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Taking live tests provides a very accurate all-India rank, which helped him gauge his preparation effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Remarkably, his best rank in a [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] grand test was 4, mirroring his final INI CET rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This correlation highlights the accuracy of Marrow's test design, which mimics historical and future exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Note-Taking Strategy with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] Notes

Dr. Dian was not a "passionate note-taker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Instead, he preferred to watch videos and jot down essential points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He used the printed notes provided by [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]], utilizing the active space within them to quickly add points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. He would underline and add relevant information directly into these notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Custom Modules and Bookmarks

*   **Bookmarks**: Dr. Dian found the bookmark feature useful for saving volatile facts or important information not explicitly covered in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Although he accumulated many bookmarks and couldn't review all of them before the exam, they served as reminders for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules**: He didn't use custom modules extensively until the last two to three months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. In this final phase, he used them as a daily "good head start," doing sets of 50 or 100 questions to get his mind running and ensure he revised at least 50 to 100 things daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Staying Updated with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] Editions

Having used [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] since Edition 4 or 5 (now Edition 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, Dr. Dian kept himself updated primarily through the "updates" section in [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This section provided new information, which is crucial as medicine constantly evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. For subjects like pharmacology or surgery with frequent updates, he would check the specific video notes or discuss with juniors to identify new developments, then add the information to his existing notes without re-watching entire videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. He emphasized sticking to an original source of preparation and only adding new information as required, rather than repeatedly watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

> "The base information, the home base of your information should be one and it should be logged in. You just keep on adding information when and where you feel you know required." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

## Advice for Aspirants: Start Early!

Dr. Dian's core advice for aspiring students is to **begin early** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Starting early offers significant benefits:
*   Time to assess strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   Opportunity to work on subjects and polish them into "muscle memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   Avoids stress associated with limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   Allows for adequately spaced study sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   Consistent daily effort accumulates significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

Given the enormous syllabus, content, exam expectations, and competition, starting early is key to overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

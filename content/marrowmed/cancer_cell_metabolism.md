Cancer cells exhibit a peculiar metabolic characteristic where they consume more glucose than normal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This increased glucose utilization is primarily due to its conversion into lactate, even in the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Aerobic Glycolysis

This process, where glucose is converted to lactate despite the presence of oxygen, is termed **aerobic glycolysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. Even with intact oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen, and mitochondrial pathways, glucose in cancer cells is channeled towards lactate production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

A consequence of this metabolic pathway is a reduced ATP yield, with only two ATP molecules produced per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. This deficiency in ATP necessitates the uptake of more glucose by the cancer cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Therefore, the most prominent feature contributing to this high glucose consumption is increased lactate production even in the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

## Underlying Mechanism

The exact reason for this metabolic shift is referred to as [[metabolic_reprogramming_and_PKM2 | metabolic reprogramming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. This involves the presence of an isoform of pyruvate kinase called PKM2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. While normal cells typically have PKM1, cancer cells often exhibit the dimeric form, PKM2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This new theory of [[metabolic_reprogramming_and_PKM2 | metabolic reprogramming]] has replaced the older concept of the Warburg hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.

Other factors like Glucose Transporter 2 (GLUT2) are not universally responsible, as GLUT2 is primarily found in beta cells of the pancreas, liver, and specific other sites, not all cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Increased fatty acid oxidation or conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA are not the primary mechanisms for increased glucose consumption in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

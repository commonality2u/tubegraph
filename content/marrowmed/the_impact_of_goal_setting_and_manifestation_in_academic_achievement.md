Yashaswi, a Marrow user who completed his MBBS in Russia, achieved the highest score in this year's FMG exam, scoring an impressive 257 out of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His journey highlights the profound impact of clear goal setting and consistent manifestation in achieving academic excellence.

## Setting Ambitious Goals

Initially, Yashaswi was not focused on giving the FMG exam during his first year of MBBS in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, upon returning to India, he gained significant motivation from witnessing his parents' sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This inspiration ignited a desire to achieve the success he hoped for during his NEET UG days, where he had scored 300 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Despite the changed examination platform, he set an ambitious goal: "I will aim for 300... during my FMG time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This clear objective "set a fire" within him, establishing his determined path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Power of Manifestation

A crucial aspect of Yashaswi's strategy was his belief in manifestation. He created a visual aid: a printout featuring a photograph of a previous topper, Dr. Saket Subham, who had scored 257 marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Yashaswi adapted this image, changing the goal to "300 out of 300" for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He then taped this photograph in front of his study table, ensuring he saw it daily during his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> "this was the motivation for me and this came true so I just believe in manifesta things and you just have to keep working hard for that nobody can stop you after that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>

This constant visual reminder served as a powerful motivator, reinforcing his goal and belief in his ability to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Positive Thinking and Discipline

Yashaswi's success was not just about manifestation but also about the [[overcoming_challenges_and_persistence_in_achieving_academic_goals | discipline]] and [[dealing_with_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation | persistence]] to work towards his goals. He embraced a philosophy of "positive thinking" and "having a goal and then working towards it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His parents attested to his incredible [[role_of_parental_support_in_academic_success | discipline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He maintained a disciplined routine, ensuring 7-8 hours of sleep, which he considered crucial for grasping concepts, while dedicating the rest of the day to focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. He believed in full concentration during study time without compromising on sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Strategic Preparation

Yashaswi's preparation strategy was meticulously aligned with his goals:
*   **Early Start**: He began using Marrow after his fourth year, around 2022, watching all videos at his own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **QBank Focus**: He consistently used the NEET PG QBank, aiming for 300 marks and giving 100% effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He solved questions immediately after completing a topic to reinforce concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. He utilized Marrow's bookmark features (red for less than 30-50% correct, yellow for questions with important explanations, blue for previous year questions) to effectively review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. He completed over 85% of the QBank during college and reset it using "Clean Slate" for further practice in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Daily Question Solving**: In the last six months, he solved over 100 questions daily, including custom modules of incorrect questions and mixed bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This consistent practice is vital for an MCQ exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTS)**: [[The impact of consistent practice tests on exam performance | Consistent practice tests]] were integral to his preparation. He gave over 40-50 GTS, including all live GTS and past year GTS after returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. His scores consistently improved, reaching above 200 in the last six months and even matching his actual exam score of 257 in his last two live GTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. He reviewed GTS by focusing on incorrect answers, creating custom modules to convert "incorrects into corrects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Revision Strategy**: In the final six months, he focused on rapid revision videos (after having completed main videos earlier) and their notes, QBank, and GTS, aiming for four to five revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   [[Overcoming challenges and improving performance in competitive exams | Overcoming Weaknesses]]: He identified weaker subjects like Physiology and focused on important topics, revising them multiple times while reducing focus on stronger subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Future Goals

Yashaswi continues to apply the same principles to his future endeavors, manifesting 100% success for the NEET PG exam, aiming to become a top ranker and specialize in Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. He advises his peers not to underestimate themselves and to keep working hard, assuring them that results will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

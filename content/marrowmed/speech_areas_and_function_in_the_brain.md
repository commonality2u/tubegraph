Speech function in the brain is mediated by several interconnected areas, which are often tested in examinations due to their clinical relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. These regions are crucial for both producing and comprehending language.

## Key Speech Areas

There are four primary areas in the brain that play significant roles in speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>:

### Broca's Area
*   **Location**: Situated in the left inferior frontal gyrus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, specifically corresponding to Broadmann areas 44 and 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Function**: This is considered the motor speech area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, responsible for speech production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Lesion Effect**: Damage to Broca's area results in Broca's aphasia, also known as non-fluent aphasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Wernicke's Area
*   **Location**: Found at the posterior end of the superior temporal gyrus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, corresponding to Broadmann area 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Function**: Wernicke's area is the sensory area for speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. It is active when an individual is listening, understanding, and comprehending information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, performing what is known as "receptive speech function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Lesion Effect**: A lesion in Wernicke's area causes Wernicke's aphasia, also known as fluent aphasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This means reception, understanding, and comprehension of speech will be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Arcuate Fasciculus
*   **Function**: This is a bidirectional communication pathway that connects Broca's area and Wernicke's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Lesion Effect**: Damage to the arcuate fasciculus leads to conduction aphasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Angular Gyrus
*   **Function**: The angular gyrus is involved in conveying visual information to speech areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This allows individuals to see an object and name it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Lesion Effect**: Problems in the angular gyrus can result in anomic aphasia, where an individual can see an object but is unable to verbally identify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

These four areas — Broca's, Wernicke's, the arcuate fasciculus, and the angular gyrus — form a critical network for language processing in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

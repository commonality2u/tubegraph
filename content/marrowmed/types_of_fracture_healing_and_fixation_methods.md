Fracture healing mechanisms vary based on the stability of the fracture site. Generally, there are two main types of fracture healing: primary healing and secondary healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

## Primary Fracture Healing

Primary healing occurs when there is rigid fixation and absolute stability at the fracture site, with no movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This type of healing is typically achieved through compression at the fracture site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Rigid fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, absolute stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   No movement at the fracture site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
    *   Compression at the fracture site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
    *   No callus formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Healing**: Occurs via [[terminologies_in_fracture_healing | intramembranous ossification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>, where bone grows directly within the bone without any cartilage formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Fixation Methods**:
    *   Compression plating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
    *   Lag screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
    *   Example: Stabilizing a radius and ulna fracture with dynamic compression plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Secondary Fracture Healing

Secondary healing involves callus formation and occurs when there is some relative movement, tension, or torsion (micro-movement) at the fracture site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. This type of healing is considered stronger and better, and can be visualized on X-ray by the presence of callus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Relatively stable fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
    *   Some micro-movement allowed at the fracture site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
    *   Callus formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Healing**: Occurs via [[terminologies_in_fracture_healing | endochondral ossification]], where cartilage is formed, and then bone forms over that cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Fixation Methods**:
    *   Natural healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
    *   Intramedullary nailing (e.g., for femur shaft fracture with close reduction internal fixation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
    *   Bridge plating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a> (a technique where plates stabilize the bone without compressing the fracture site, allowing relative movement and inducing callus formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
    *   Non-rigid fixations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
    *   Braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
    *   External fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

## Growth Plate Injuries and Healing

The epiphyseal plate (physeal plate or growth plate) is crucial for the longitudinal growth of bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. If the growth plate is injured, longitudinal growth will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

*   **Growth Plate Layers**: The growth plate consists of several layers: germinal, proliferative, hypertrophic, calcification, and ossification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
    *   **Germinal Layer**: Most important layer for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
    *   **Hypertrophic Layer**: Weakest and most commonly injured layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Classification**: [[basics_of_fracture_management | Growth plate injuries]] are classified using the Salter-Harris classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>:
    *   **Type I**: Split fracture where the growth plate separates from the metaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   **Type II**: Fracture with a split extending into the metaphysis, forming a small triangular metaphyseal fragment (Thurston Holland fragment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This is often seen in supracondylar humerus fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   **Type III**: Fracture line splits and goes low towards the epiphysis, injuring the germinal layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Type IV**: Fracture line passes through all three layers (epiphysis, physis, metaphysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   **Type V**: Impaction injury where the growth plate is crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Specific Fracture Examples and Related Fixation/Healing

### Proximal Femur Fractures

*   **Intertrochanteric fracture**: This is an extracapsular neck of femur fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Fixation Devices**:
    *   [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices | Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS)]]: A plate with a mobile sliding screw, also known as a Richards screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Used to prevent malunion, specifically coxa vara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices | Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN)]]: An intramedullary device where a nail is inserted into the medullary cavity, and proximal screws maintain the neck-shaft angle to prevent coxa vara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Complication**: Malunion leading to coxa vara, which results in a Trendelenburg limp or gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Supracondylar Humerus Fracture

*   **Description**: A clear-cut fracture just above the condyle of the humerus, often with posterior displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. The extension type is the most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Gartland's classification is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>:
    *   **Type I**: Undisplaced fracture, often only visible through indirect signs like the fat pad sign and sail sign on X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Type II**: Incomplete fracture where only the anterior cortex is broken, and the posterior cortex remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   **Type III**: Complete fracture with breach of both anterior and posterior cortices and displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Complications**:
    *   **Most Common**: Malunion, leading to cubitus varus deformity (gunstock deformity), where the forearm is directed towards the midline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
    *   **Nerve Injury**: Most commonly the anterior interosseous nerve, followed by the median nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
    *   **Artery Injury**: Most commonly the brachial artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
    *   **Delayed Complication**: Myositis ossificans, which occurs in patients who have undergone massage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### Lateral Condyle Humerus Fracture

*   **Description**: Injury to the germinal layer of the growth plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
*   **Deformity**: Because the lateral condyle does not grow (due to non-union), the medial condyle continues to grow, leading to cubitus valgus deformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Complication**: Tardy ulnar nerve palsy, which occurs later due to the valgus deformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Jones Fracture

*   **Description**: A fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Healing Challenges**: Notorious for delayed union, fibrous union, and non-union, as the chances of healing are very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Treatment**:
    *   **Conservative**: Below-knee POP cast for roughly 6 to 8 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This is an exception to the usual 4-6 weeks for cast use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
    *   **Surgical**: If conservative treatment fails, intramedullary screw fixation can be used to prevent non-union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Spinal Fractures

*   **Chance Fracture (Jack-knife fracture)**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Occurs due to flexion and distraction forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, commonly in road traffic accidents involving a lap belt without a shoulder harness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The body flexes on the lap belt with inertia causing distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **Description**: A fracture that extends through all three columns of the spine, running from the posterior elements all the way to the anterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
    *   **Types**: Can be bony (through bony elements) or soft tissue (through ligaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Fracture of the Spinous Process**: Involves the posterior elements of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Typically occurs in the cervical spine, known as a Clay Shoveler's fracture, due to aggressive use of the upper limb or strong paraspinal muscle contracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Compression Fracture**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Occurs when bones become soft, typically in osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
    *   **Description**: A wedge compression, where the anterior wall of the vertebra becomes shorter than the posterior wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Burst Fracture**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Caused by axial loading, such as falling from a height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   **Description**: Fragments of the vertebra burst out anteriorly and posteriorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

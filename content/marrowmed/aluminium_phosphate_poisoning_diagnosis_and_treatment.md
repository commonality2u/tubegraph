Aluminium phosphate is a commonly encountered [[poison classification and effects | poison]], particularly prevalent in North India, where it is often found as a rat killer tablet [00:10:28]. These tablets are sold under names such as "Quick Force", "C Force", and "Al Force", with one tablet typically containing 3 grams of aluminium phosphate [00:10:44].

## Mechanism of Toxicity

When ingested, aluminium phosphate reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach or with moisture, liberating highly toxic phosphine gas [00:11:05]. Even 1 gram of phosphine gas is considered highly toxic [00:11:20]. This gas has a characteristic garlic odor [00:11:26].

Phosphine acts as a protoplasmic [[poison classification and effects | poison]], affecting cellular functions by:
*   Attacking cell cytochrome oxidase [00:11:38]
*   Inducing lipid peroxidation of cells [00:11:40]
*   Damaging mitochondria [00:11:45]

## Clinical Manifestations

Patients suffering from aluminium phosphate poisoning can present with a range of severe symptoms due to widespread cellular damage:
*   Profound shock [00:12:11]
*   Pulmonary edema [00:09:41] and diffuse lung damage, leading to ARDS-like features [00:12:23]
*   Metabolic acidosis [00:11:50]
*   Disturbances in magnesium levels, often causing hypomagnesemia [00:12:01]
*   Cardiac arrhythmias [00:12:19]

## Diagnosis

A crucial diagnostic tool for aluminium phosphate poisoning is the [[common_poisonings_and_their_symptoms_in_forensic_toxicology | silver nitrate breath test]] [00:09:43]. This test can be performed at the bedside [00:13:00]:
*   A silver nitrate filter paper is held in front of the patient's mouth [00:13:03].
*   If phosphine gas is present in the exhaled breath, it reacts with the silver nitrate, turning the paper black [00:13:10].
*   This black discoloration confirms the presence of phosphine gas, strongly suggesting aluminium phosphate poisoning [00:13:30].
Other methods include testing gastric aspirate or vomitus with silver nitrate [00:12:42].

## Treatment

There is no specific antidote for aluminium phosphate poisoning [00:13:57]. Treatment primarily focuses on supportive care and addressing complications:

### Initial Management
*   **Stabilization**: The first step is to stabilize the patient's vital signs [00:13:40].
*   **Decontamination**: Gastric lavage can be performed [00:13:47]. Historically, potassium permanganate solution was used for gastric lavage, but decontamination can also be done without it [00:13:51].

### Symptomatic Treatment
*   **Shock**: If the patient is in shock, administer IV fluids and implement anti-shock measures [00:14:03].
*   **Hypomagnesemia**: If present, this should be addressed [00:14:10].
*   **ARDS**: Mechanical ventilation is necessary for patients with ARDS-like features [00:14:14].
*   **Arrhythmias**: Anti-arrhythmic measures should be taken [00:14:19].

### Magnesium Sulfate (Historical Use)
While not a direct antidote, [[magnesium_sulfate_uses_in_prenatal_care | magnesium sulfate]] was historically given as a treatment in some cases [00:10:06]. However, it is important to note that currently, there is no specific antidote [00:13:57].

> [!WARNING] Copper Sulfate for Phosphorus Poisoning
> Copper sulfate, while itself a metallic [[poison classification and effects | poison]], was previously used for [[phosphorus_poisoning_and_treatment | phosphorus poisoning]] [00:04:52]. It was applied topically to burns to combine with [[phosphorus_poisoning_and_treatment | phosphorus]], forming a black discoloration (cupric phosphate) to facilitate removal [00:08:34]. It was also given orally via gastric lavage [00:09:09]. However, copper sulfate is no longer recommended for either topical or oral use due to its own toxicity [00:09:27]. This historical context explains why a question about [[copper | copper sulfate]] as a treatment for [[phosphorus_poisoning_and_treatment | phosphorus poisoning]] might arise, even though it's outdated practice [00:05:27].

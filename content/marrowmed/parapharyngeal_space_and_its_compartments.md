The parapharyngeal space is a lateral pharyngeal space located lateral to the pharyngeal wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. It is described as a pyramidal space, starting from the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | base of the skull]] superiorly and extending down to the hyoid bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. The lateral boundary of the parapharyngeal space includes the mandible along with its attached muscles, such as the medial pterygoid and masseter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

## Compartments of the Parapharyngeal Space

The parapharyngeal space is divided by the [[important_anatomical_structures_for_surgical_procedures | styloid process]] into two main compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>:
1.  **Prestyloid (Anterior) Compartment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>
2.  **Poststyloid (Posterior) Compartment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>

### Prestyloid Compartment

The anterior compartment contains mainly fat, along with some vessels and nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. Abscesses are more common in this compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

### Poststyloid Compartment

The posterior compartment contains numerous important vessels and nerves that travel between the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | base of the skull]] and the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. These include:
*   Internal carotid artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>
*   Internal jugular vein (IJV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>
*   [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | Cranial nerves]] IX, X, XI, and XII (the last four [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | cranial nerves]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>
*   Cervical sympathetic trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>

Neurogenic tumors are more common in the posterior compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## Clinical Features of Parapharyngeal Space Abscesses/Masses

A mass or abscess in the parapharyngeal space will first compactly fill the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. This can lead to:

*   **External Bulge:** A bulge at the upper border of the sternocleidomastoid or at the angle of the jaw can be seen in both anterior and posterior compartment involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. A parotid bulge may also be seen in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Medial Displacement of [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | Tonsils]]:** The mass can push the lateral wall of the pharynx, and subsequently the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | tonsils]], medially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.
    *   In an anterior compartment mass, the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | tonsil]] will appear pushed medially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
    *   In a posterior compartment mass, the lateral pharyngeal wall will be pushed medially behind the posterior pillar of the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | tonsil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Trismus:** Difficulty in opening the mouth due to spasm of masticator muscles can occur, especially in anterior compartment involvement due to its close relation to pterygoid muscles and the pterygomandibular raphe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

### Differentiating Features

| Feature                 | Prestyloid (Anterior) Compartment                                  | Poststyloid (Posterior) Compartment                                     |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bulge Inside Mouth**  | [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | Tonsil]] pushed medially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a> | Bulge seen behind the posterior pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>           |
| **Trismus**             | Present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>                                                               | May be present, but less common than anterior compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a> |
| **Nerve Involvement**   | Not typically seen (e.g., [[gag_reflex_and_associated_nerves | glossopharyngeal nerve]] palsy is not seen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a> | Common (e.g., [[gag_reflex_and_associated_nerves | glossopharyngeal nerve]] palsy, Horner's syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>  |
| **External Bulge**      | Present (angle of jaw, parotid region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>        | Present (angle of jaw, parotid region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>          |

### Distinguishing Parapharyngeal Abscess from Peritonsillar Abscess (Quinsy)

Both conditions can cause medial displacement of the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | tonsil]] and trismus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. However, a parapharyngeal abscess will also present with an external bulge at the angle of the jaw, which is typically absent in a peritonsillar abscess (Quinsy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. Additionally, in a parapharyngeal abscess, the lateral pharyngeal wall itself is pushed medially, whereas in a peritonsillar abscess, only the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | tonsil]] is pushed medially, and the lateral pharyngeal wall is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

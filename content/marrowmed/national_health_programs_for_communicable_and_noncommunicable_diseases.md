In the NEETPG 2024 exam, [[community_medicine_in_neetpg | Community Medicine]] questions focused heavily on national health programs, including those for communicable and non-communicable diseases, and [[mother_and_child_health_programs_and_family_planning | Mother and Child Health (MCH)]] topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These areas consistently generated a significant number of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across both sessions of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Key Health Programs and Topics Examined

### Communicable Diseases

Several questions specifically addressed [[national_health_programs_and_communicable_diseases | national health programs]] and management strategies for communicable diseases:
*   **National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP)**:
    *   The logo for NLEP was asked in Session 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The logo features a lotus flower representing a leprosy patient and a "Ray of Hope" signifying Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   The SAA image related to leprosy was asked in Session 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Malaria**:
    *   Questions included treatment protocols for mixed *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium falciparum* infections, specifically the dosage on the second day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. The treatment involves Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT), with Artemisinin given for three days and Primaquine (0.25 mg/kg for 14 days for mixed infections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Kala-azar (Visceral Leishmaniasis)**:
    *   Diagnosis was covered in Session 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   It is prevalent in regions like Bihar and West Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
    *   Symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
    *   The vector for Kala-azar is *Phlebotomus argentipes* (sandfly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Tuberculosis (TB)**:
    *   Treatment and prophylaxis were questions in both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   Specifically, the 3HP TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) regimen (3 months of weekly Isoniazid and Rifapentine) was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
    *   For multi-drug resistant (MDR) and Rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB, a shorter Bedaquiline-containing regimen is given if only Rifampicin or Isoniazid resistance with a single gene mutation (e.g., *katG*) is detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.
    *   For people living with HIV (PLHIV), 6 months of Isoniazid (6H) is the preferred prophylaxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.
*   **Diphtheria**: Management of contacts was asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Asymptomatic contacts receive prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Erythromycin or a single dose of Penicillin G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
    *   Vaccination status is assessed: if three complete doses were received within the last 5 years, no extra vaccine is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
*   **Cholera Vaccine**: Sanocchol vaccine was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Sanocchol is a bivalent vaccine (for O1 and O139 strains) given in two liquid doses, two weeks apart, for ages more than 1 year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

### Non-Communicable Diseases and General Health

*   **[[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | Nutrition and Deficiency Diseases]]**:
    *   Questions on micronutrients, specifically Thiamine in rice, were asked in Session 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Brown rice or parboiled rice are good sources of Thiamine (Vitamin B1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
    *   Pellagra (Vitamin B3 deficiency) was questioned in Session 2, characterized by the 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and eventually Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. It is often associated with maize consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
    *   Sanguinarine dropsy (epidemic dropsy), caused by *Argemone mexicana* contamination in mustard oil, requires Chromatography Test as the most sensitive investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Ayushman Bharat School Health Program**:
    *   This program includes health screening, deworming for school-going children (as part of [[national_health_programs_and_disease_prevention | Anemia Mukt Bharat]]), and providing sanitary napkins for adolescent girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
    *   A misleading option suggested "monthly IFA tablets," but the correct approach is "weekly IFA tablets" (WIFS) for adults and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

## General Public Health Concepts and Indicators

*   **Health Indicators**:
    *   **Human Development Index (HDI)**: A question on HDI components was asked, including life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling, and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. India's HDI is 0.640, ranking 132 globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
    *   **Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI)**: Components include life expectancy at 1 year, literacy rate, and infant mortality rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. It does *not* include income or Gross National Product (GNP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
    *   Other indicators like Global Hunger Index (GHI) and Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) were also mentioned as important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Iceberg Phenomenon of Disease**:
    *   This concept describes diseases where a large proportion of cases remain sub-clinical or asymptomatic, forming the "submerged" part of the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Diseases that *show* the iceberg phenomenon include Polio, Measles, Mumps, Influenza, Diphtheria, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Rubella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Influenza has a high percentage (50-70%) of asymptomatic infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   Diseases that do *not* show the iceberg phenomenon include Measles, Tetanus, and Rabies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Maternal Mortality**:
    *   [[maternal_and_child_health_programs | Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]] is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births, multiplied by 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
    *   A maternal death is defined as any female death due to pregnancy or related causes within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of duration or site of pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. This includes conditions like sepsis, eclampsia, ectopic pregnancy, and obstructed labor, but excludes accidental deaths like snake bite or road traffic accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.
    *   Maternal Mortality Rate (MMRate) uses total women in reproductive age as the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
*   **Neonatal Mortality**:
    *   Early Neonatal Mortality Rate is calculated as deaths of children less than 7 days old divided by live births, multiplied by 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)**:
    *   As per the MTP Act Amendment 2021:
        *   One doctor's approval is needed for MTP up to 20 weeks of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
        *   Two doctors' approval is needed for MTP between 20 to 24 weeks in specific categories (e.g., sexual assault, rape, minor, change in marital status, major disability, fetal malformations, humanitarian settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
        *   After 24 weeks, medical board approval is required only in cases of fetal anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   **Family Planning**:
    *   The earliest time for Intrauterine Device (IUD) insertion after normal vaginal delivery is within 10 minutes (post-placental) or within 48 hours (post-partum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. After 48 hours, insertion is only done after 6 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
*   **Demographic Cycle**:
    *   The five stages are: High Stationary, Early Expanding, Late Expanding, Low Stationary, and Declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
    *   Birth rate and death rate lines define these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Longevity Dividend**:
    *   This concept is linked to [[mother_and_child_health_programs_and_family_planning | demographic dividend]], where a higher number of economically productive people leads to increased lifespan and subsequent economic and health benefits for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.
*   **Disaster Management Cycle**:
    *   The phases include Disaster Impact, Response, Rehabilitation, Mitigation, Preparedness, and Capacity Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Rehabilitation is often the longest phase, while early immediate response (within 6 hours) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Quarantine and Isolation**:
    *   **Isolation** is for diseased individuals (cases) and is done for the maximum period of communicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.
    *   **Quarantine** is for healthy individuals (contacts) and is done for the maximum incubation period known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. Both are primary levels of prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **JSSK (Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram)**:
    *   A program that provides free OPD and IPD treatment, including delivery and transport, to decrease out-of-pocket expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The full form is Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## Biostatistics and Epidemiology Concepts

*   **Sampling Methods**:
    *   **Stratified Sampling**: Dividing a population into strata based on certain criteria and then taking random samples from each stratum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This was distinguished from simple random, systematic, and cluster sampling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Measures of Central Tendency**:
    *   **Median**: The central value in a data set arranged in ascending or descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. If the number of values is even, it's the average of the two middle values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Tests of Significance**:
    *   Selection depends on the type of data (parametric/non-parametric, quantitative/qualitative) and the number of groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    *   For quantitative, parametric data with a single group (e.g., pre/post-testing cholesterol levels), a Paired T-Test is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
    *   For qualitative, non-parametric data with two groups (e.g., disease incidence in vegetarians vs. non-vegetarians), a Chi-Square test is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Case-Control Study Steps**:
    *   The typical order involves selecting cases and controls, matching them, measuring exposure, and then analyzing the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Environmental Health and Other Public Health Aspects

*   **Communication Barriers**:
    *   Different types include physiological, psychological, environmental (e.g., noise), and cultural (e.g., language differences, different beliefs/concepts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Misinterpretation of words is a [[community_medicine_exam_patterns | cultural barrier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Kata Thermometer**:
    *   Used to measure low air velocities and the cooling power of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Other instruments like a simple thermometer (air temperature), hygrometer/psychrometer (air humidity), and globe thermometer (radiant heat) measure different parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Air Quality Standards**:
    *   The standard of 3,000 cubic feet of fresh air supply per person per hour is based on Carbon Dioxide content to ensure stale air is replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **Early Newborn Care**:
    *   Steps include Apgar scoring, airway clearance, maintaining body temperature (skin-to-skin contact), cord care, skin care, and eye care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Bathing should be delayed for at least 24 hours due to the risk of hypothermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Motivation Model of Health Education**:
    *   Comprises three stages: Awareness, Motivation, and Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

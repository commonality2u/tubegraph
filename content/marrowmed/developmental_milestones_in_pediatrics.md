Discussions regarding [[milestones_in_child_development | child development]] often revolve around understanding the typical timeline for various [[milestones_in_child_development | developmental achievements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It is crucial to distinguish between normal variations and actual [[milestones_in_child_development | developmental delays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Key Motor Milestones

*   **Rolling Over**: This milestone is typically attained by 4 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Sitting Without Support**:
    *   Normally achieved by 8 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   A [[milestones_in_child_development | developmental delay]] for this milestone is considered if it is not attained by 10 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The upper limit for attaining sitting with support is 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Standing with Assistance**: The upper limit for attaining this milestone is 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Key Social and Communication Milestones

*   **Bisyllable Words (e.g., "mama", "dada")**: A child can typically say words like "mama" and "dada" (bisyllable words) by 9 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Stranger Anxiety**: This social milestone is typically attained by 6 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **First Vocalization**: If a child has not achieved their first vocalization by 6 months, it can be considered a delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Identifying Developmental Delay

According to the OPGA textbook, the "upper limit for attainment of milestone" refers to the age by which a milestone *must* be achieved; if it is not attained by that age, it can be classified as a delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Normal Developmental Variant
> A 9-month-old child who can roll over, say "mama" and "dada", and exhibits stranger anxiety, but is unable to sit without support, is considered within the normal [[milestones_in_child_development | developmental variant]] range. Reassurance to parents is the appropriate next step in management, as the delay threshold for sitting without support is 10 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

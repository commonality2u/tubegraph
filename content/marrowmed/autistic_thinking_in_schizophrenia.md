Autistic thinking, also referred to as syloism, is a type of thought process observed in patients with [[schizophrenia_symptoms | schizophrenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. This concept is often found in traditional psychiatry textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

## Syloism
Syloism involves formulating a conclusion (statement three) by combining two preceding statements (statement one and statement two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Normal Syloism
In typical thought processes, syloism leads to logical conclusions that make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Even individuals without a mental health condition can exhibit syloism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

Consider these examples:
*   **Example 1**:
    *   All police are trained to know about law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
    *   A sub-inspector knows about law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
    *   Therefore, a sub-inspector is a police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Example 2**:
    *   All birds have wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   A pigeon has wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
    *   Therefore, a pigeon is a bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

## Autistic Thinking in Schizophrenia
In the context of [[schizophrenia_symptoms | schizophrenia]], autistic thinking signifies a thought process that:
*   **Lacks Reality**: The conclusions drawn have no basis in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Is Private**: The logic is comprehensible only to the individual experiencing it; others cannot understand or accept it as true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Is Illogical**: The reasoning used to arrive at the conclusion is flawed and irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

This type of thinking is characterized by individuals being "in their own head," making calculations that others cannot grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

### Examples of Autistic Thinking
*   **Classic Example (from N. Jawaja textbook)**:
    *   "Lord Hanuman is celibate." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>
    *   "I am celibate." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>
    *   "So I am Lord Hanuman." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>
    *   _Analysis_: This conclusion lacks any basis in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

*   **Another Example**:
    *   "Police know law and order." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>
    *   "Sunil read a chapter on law and order." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>
    *   "Sunil is police." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>
    *   _Analysis_: Simply reading a chapter does not make one a police officer; this reasoning is illogical and private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Takeaway
> While normal syloism creates logical connections, autistic thinking, seen in [[schizophrenia_symptoms | schizophrenia]], forms illogical and reality-disconnected conclusions based on a private, internal logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

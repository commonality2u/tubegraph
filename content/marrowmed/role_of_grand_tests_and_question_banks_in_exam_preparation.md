Utilizing question banks and grand tests effectively is a crucial aspect of preparing for competitive medical examinations. Dr. N.R. (Naresh), who secured Rank 1 in the INI CET exam, shared his strategies for incorporating these tools into his study routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Question Banks (Qbank)

Dr. N.R. used the Marrow Qbank extensively, solving approximately 700 modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Strategy for Qbank Usage
*   **Sequential Study**: He would solve a question bank module *after* reading a particular topic from his theory sources, rather than blindly attempting questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:50">[04:48:50]</a>. This allowed him to understand the specific areas that exams tend to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Correctness**: He aimed for a 70% to 80% correctness rate in Qbank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:30">[06:30:30]</a>. If questions were too difficult, he would learn the answer then and there and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Staying Updated**: Question banks were particularly helpful for keeping up with recent updates and information not yet incorporated into standard textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, such as new editions of pathology books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Marrow's Qbank provides pop-up notifications for revised answers or updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Managing Bookmarks and Custom Modules
*   **Volume of Bookmarks**: Dr. N.R. accumulated close to 5,000 bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **Revision Strategy**: He would revisit his bookmarks regularly, especially during less hectic periods like after night duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Categorization**: Marrow provides three categories of bookmarks, which he used to focus on key areas or recent updates that could provide an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   **Magic Module**: He utilized the "Magic Module" feature, which allows revisiting wrong MCQs, finding it very helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules and Tags**: While not extensively, he did use custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, primarily for clinical questions and recent updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, especially closer to the NEET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## The Role of Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. N.R. admits to being a late starter when it came to Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

### When to Start and Frequency
*   He began taking GTs around January of his internship, about three-quarters of the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   Initially, he took GTs about once a month (January-March) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:08]</a>.
*   Closer to the INI CET exam, he significantly increased his frequency to two to three GTs per week, feeling he lacked exam practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

### Purpose and Benefits
*   **Switching to Exam Mode**: GTs help transition from content consumption to an exam-oriented mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Weaknesses**: They reveal areas where one is lacking, providing valuable insights for targeted study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarking Performance**: GTs help assess where one stands in the competition and gauge preparedness for easy, moderate, and difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.
*   **Confidence Booster**: Despite initial low confidence, achieving decent scores (e.g., 150-160 correct) in GTs served as a significant morale booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.
*   **Recommendation for Early Start**: Dr. N.R. recommends starting GTs at an earlier stage of preparation, ideally during the internship, to identify weaknesses and get a realistic assessment of one's standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

### Unique GT Strategy
*   **Segmented Approach**: Due to time constraints, he did not take GTs in one continuous three-hour slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.
*   **Simulated Exam Conditions**: He broke them down into 40-45 minute slots, answering questions under timed conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>.
*   **Efficient Analysis**: After each 45-minute block, he would review only the wrong questions or those that provided new information, completing the review in 15-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. This allowed him to simulate exam conditions without dedicating an entire day, enabling him to continue with his personal study and syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.
*   **Average Performance**: He consistently scored above 170-175 correct answers, sometimes crossing 190 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Stagnation
*   When his GT scores stagnated, he relied on the GT analysis feature of the platform to identify his weak subjects and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. He would bookmark these questions and then revisit the problematic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

## General Advice on [[Effective Use of Question Banks and Mock Tests|Question Banks and Grand Tests]]
For those starting their internship, Dr. N.R. advises setting daily targets, being consistent with Qbank usage, and never giving up, even if goals are not met daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>. Visiting the Qbank to identify weaknesses and revising them is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes that early engagement with Grand Tests can provide positive reinforcement and boost confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>.

This article discusses the diagnosis and management strategies for genital organ prolapse and uterine fibroids, as presented in a recall session for NEET PG 2024.

## Genital Organ Prolapse

Genital organ prolapse occurs when pelvic organs drop from their normal position. Diagnosis involves identifying the type of prolapse and its severity.

### Diagnosis of Prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

When assessing an image of prolapse, the first step is to determine if it is a prolapse of the vagina or the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

*   **Cystocele** (anterior wall of vagina prolapsing, upper part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
*   **Urethrocele** (anterior wall of vagina prolapsing, lower part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   **Rectocele** (posterior wall of vagina prolapsing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>
*   **Enterocele** (pouch of Douglas prolapsed with intestines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   **Uterine prolapse** (uterus itself has prolapsed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   **Vault prolapse** (vaginal stump prolapsed after hysterectomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>

### Classification of Prolapse

**Shaw Classification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>
The reference point for Shaw classification was the introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **First degree prolapse:** Cervix comes inside the vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Second degree prolapse:** Cervix comes up to the level of the introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Third degree prolapse:** Cervix and uterus lie outside the introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Procidentia:** Entire uterus, cervix, and vaginal wall have prolapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

**POP-Q (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) Classification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>
This classification is currently used, with the hymen as the reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Stage Two prolapse:** Prolapsed part lies within 1 cm on either side of the hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Stage One prolapse:** Prolapsed part lies more than 1 cm above the hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Stage Three prolapse:** Prolapsed part lies more than 1 cm below the hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Procidentia:** Entire uterus, cervix, and vaginal wall are prolapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   The POP-Q grid is used to diagnose the degree of prolapse by measuring nine reference points relative to the hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Surgical Management of Prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>

*   **Vaginal Prolapse:**
    *   **Cystocele and Urethrocele:** Always managed by anterior colporrhaphy, regardless of age or family completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
    *   **Enterocele:** Managed by McCal caloplasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. Outdated surgeries include Moschcowitz repair and Halban repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
    *   **Rectocele:** Managed by posterior colpoperniorrhaphy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Uterine Prolapse:** Should be treated surgically when it is a third-degree prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
    *   **Reproductive Age Female (desiring future childbearing):** Sling surgeries like Sacrocolpopexy (also known as sacro pexy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>.
    *   **Reproductive Age Female (not desiring future childbearing, especially with cervical elongation):** Fothergill's repair or Manchester repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. Key steps include amputation of the cervix and plication of cardinal ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
    *   **Menopausal Female (most common age group):** Vaginal hysterectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. If concurrent cystocele and rectocele are present, it's called Ward Mayo's hysterectomy (vaginal hysterectomy + anterior colporrhaphy + posterior colpoperniorrhaphy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
    *   **Menopausal Female (with contraindication to surgery):** Le Fort's Colpocleisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
    *   **Female > 65 years with comorbidities, or Pregnant/Postpartum Female:** Ring pessary insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

*   **Management of Vault Prolapse:**
    *   **Vaginal Surgery:** Uterosacral suspension (most commonly done) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
    *   **Abdominal Surgery (Best Surgery):** Sacral colpopexy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
    *   When placing a mesh for vault prolapse or sling surgery, it must be attached to the sacral promontory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.
        *   For vault prolapse, one side attaches to the sacral promontory and the other to the vaginal vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>.
        *   For sling surgery, one side attaches to the sacral promontory and the other to the isthmus of the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:31">[01:45:31]</a>.

*   **Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI):**
    *   **Gold Standard Surgery:** Burch Colposuspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Most Commonly Performed:** [[urinary_incontinence_treatment_options_and_considerations | Tension-free transobturator tape (TOT)]] followed by [[urinary_incontinence_treatment_options_and_considerations | tension-free transvaginal tape (TVT)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Uterine Fibroids

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus, also known as leiomyomas.

### Characteristics and Diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>

*   **Appearance:** Fibroids typically have a rough contour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Origin:** They arise from a broad base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.
*   **Color:** White in color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.
*   **Encapsulation:** Well-circumscribed, often surrounded by a pseudo-capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.
*   **Vascularity:** The most vascular part is the pseudo-capsule or periphery; the least vascular part is the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
*   **Cut Section:** Shows a "whorled appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Uterine Enlargement:** Leads to asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus, potentially reaching up to 20 weeks pregnant size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis

*   **Polyps:**
    *   Appearance: Red and fleshy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.
    *   Origin: Arise from a narrow base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.
    *   Nature: Mucosal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.
    *   Vascularity: Supplied by a single blood vessel to its center, forming the basis of the "feeder vessel sign" on Doppler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.
*   **Adenomyosis:**
    *   Definition: Endometrial tissue present inside the myometrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
    *   Uterine Changes: Leads to myometrial hypertrophy, resulting in uniformly enlarged and globular uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
    *   Size: Enlargement never exceeds 12 weeks pregnant uterus size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
    *   Tenderness: Uterine tenderness is present (Halban sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
    *   Cut Section: Shows multiple hemorrhages due to hormonally active endometrium bleeding monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.

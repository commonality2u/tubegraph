The [[tnm_classification_in_surgery | TNM classification in surgery]] for breast cancer is a crucial and frequently tested topic in surgical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## TNM Staging Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### T (Tumor Size and Extent)

*   **Tis (In situ cancer)**: Includes ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and Paget's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is no longer considered an in situ lesion but rather a benign lesion with a risk of cancerous conversion, not a premalignant condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **T1**: Tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **T2**: Tumor size between 2 and 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **T3**: Tumor size more than 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **T4a**: Involvement of the chest wall, which includes ribs, intercostal muscles, and the serratus anterior muscle. Importantly, it does *not* include the pectoral muscles (pectoralis major and minor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **T4b**: Involvement of the skin, characterized by direct ulceration, *peau d'orange* (orange peel appearance due to involvement of subdermal lymphatics), and satellite nodules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Dimpling and retraction are *not* signs of skin involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **T4c**: Combines T4a and T4b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **T4d**: Inflammatory breast cancer, diagnosed when more than one-third of the skin exhibits *peau d'orange* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### N (Lymph Nodes)

*   **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **N1**: Mobile ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **N2a**: Fixed or matted ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **N2b**: Presence of ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **N3a**: Infraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **N3b**: Involvement of both internal mammary and axillary lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **N3c**: Ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### M (Distant Metastasis)

*   **M0**: No distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **M1**: Presence of distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Clinical Example: Breast Cancer Staging

> [!example] Case Presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
> A 34-year-old lady presents with a breast lump, 6 x 4 cm in size, with dimpling and bloody discharge. The lesion is invading the pectoralis major muscle. Ipsilateral level one and level two matted axillary lymph nodes are present, with no distant metastasis.

> [!solution] Staging Analysis
> *   **Tumor (T)**: The lump is 6 x 4 cm, which is greater than 5 cm, classifying it as **T3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
>     *   Dimpling is *not* considered a sign of skin involvement for T-staging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
>     *   Involvement of the pectoralis major muscle is *not* considered involvement of the chest wall for T-staging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
> *   **Nodes (N)**: Matted axillary lymph nodes are present. "Matted" signifies **N2a** disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
> *   **Metastasis (M)**: There is no distant metastasis mentioned, so it is **M0** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
>
> **Final Staging**: T3 N2a M0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Other Important TNM Classifications

While [[breast_cancer_staging_and_surgery | breast cancer]] TNM staging is vital, other important [[tnm_classification_in_surgery | TNM classification in surgery]] systems include those for:

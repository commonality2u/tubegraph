Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils. Understanding the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | anatomy of the tonsils]] is crucial for performing the surgery and managing potential complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The tonsils develop from the second pharyngeal pouch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. They are present at birth and reach maximum size by puberty (around 12 years of age), after which they begin to atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The epithelial lining of the tonsils in the oropharynx is stratified squamous and non-keratinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Laterally, the tonsils have a capsule formed by the pharyngobasilar fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The space lateral to the tonsil capsule is known as the peritonsillar space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Indications for Tonsillectomy

The decision to perform a tonsillectomy is based on specific [[indications_for_tonsilectomy | indications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Infectious Indications
The most common infectious indication is recurrent episodes of tonsillitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:
*   More than three episodes per year for three consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   More than five episodes per year for two consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   More than seven episodes in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Non-Infectious Indications
The most important non-infectious indication is when the tonsil is hugely enlarged, leading to obstructive symptoms such as sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This typically corresponds to the parenchymatous variant of tonsillitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Surgical Techniques

### Patient Positioning
For tonsillectomy, the patient is typically placed in Rose's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This involves extension at both the cervical thoracic and atlanto-occipital joints, but not hyperextension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This position is also used for adenoidectomy and tracheostomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Methods and Instruments
Surgical methods can be broadly categorized into cold or hot methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:
*   **Cold Method**: Does not involve the production of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   The most common is the dissection and snare method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   Microdebrider is also commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Hot Method**: Uses instruments that produce heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   Coblation is a common hot method, also known as "cold ablation" because it produces less heat than cautery or laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

**Common Instruments:**
*   **Bo Davis mouth gag**: Used to keep the mouth open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **East UL snare**: Used in the dissection and snare method to crush and cut the lower pole of the tonsil, where blood vessels typically enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Anterior pillar retractor**: Used to visualize the bleeding source by retracting the anterior pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Tonsil dissector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Coblation wand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Microdebrider** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Types of Tonsillectomy
*   **Extracapsular Tonsillectomy**: The entire tonsil, along with its capsule, is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This is typically performed for infectious indications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Intracapsular Tonsillectomy**: Only a part of the tonsil causing obstruction is removed, leaving some tonsil tissue behind to preserve immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This is typically performed when the tonsil is hugely enlarged and causing obstructive symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Complications

The most common [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | complication]] following tonsillectomy is [[management_of_hemorrhage_following_tonsilectomy | hemorrhage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Hemorrhage Types and Causes
Hemorrhage following tonsillectomy is typically venous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, primarily from the peritonsillar vein, also known as the external palatine vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

There are three types of hemorrhage:
*   **Primary Hemorrhage**: Occurs during the surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Reactionary Hemorrhage**: Occurs in the recovery room or within 24 hours after surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Causes include slippage of a ligature or dislodgment of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Occurs any time after 24 hours, typically within 10 days, most commonly around 5 to 6 days post-surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It is usually secondary to infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Management of Hemorrhage
Effective [[management_of_hemorrhage_following_tonsilectomy | management of hemorrhage]] is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Management begins with intravenous antibiotics due to the underlying infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Primary or Reactionary Hemorrhage**: The management steps are similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>:
    1.  **Removal of clots**: This allows for the proper clipping action of the superior constrictor muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    2.  **Pressure application**: Apply pressure with a vasoconstrictor gauze or pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    3.  **Cauterization**: Cauterize the bleeding blood vessel if visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    4.  **Ligation**: If bleeding persists, ligate the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

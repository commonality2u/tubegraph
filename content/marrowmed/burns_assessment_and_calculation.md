## Burns Assessment and Calculation

Burns percentage area calculation is a common and frequently assessed area in medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. It is crucial to read questions carefully, noting which body parts are involved and the patient's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

### Rule of Nines

The Rule of Nines is a widely used method for estimating the total body surface area (TBSA) affected by burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

#### Adult Rule of Nines

For adults, the body is divided into sections, each representing a multiple of 9% of the TBSA:
*   **Face and Neck:** Front and back together are 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
    *   Front of face alone is 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
    *   Front of neck is 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Chest:** Front of chest is 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Back of chest is 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Abdomen:** Front of abdomen is 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Back of abdomen is 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Upper Limbs:** Entire upper limb is 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
    *   Front of upper limb is 4.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   Back of upper limb is 4.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
    *   Subdivisions of the front of the upper limb: arm is 2%, forearm is 1.5%, palm is 1% (totaling 4.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Lower Limbs:** Total lower limb is 9% + 9% (front and back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
    *   Subdivisions: thigh is 5%, leg is 3%, foot is 1% (totaling 9%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Perineum:** 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

**Example Calculation (Adult):**
A 34-year-old female with dermal and epidermal burns to the face, front of the chest, and both upper limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>:
*   Face (front only, not neck): 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>
*   Front of chest: 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>
*   Both upper limbs (entire): 9% + 9% = 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>
*   Total: 3.5% + 9% + 18% = 30.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, fitting within the 27-30% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

#### Child Rule of Nines

For children, the percentages differ slightly due to different body proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>:
*   **Head and Face:** Instead of 9%, it is 18% (9% for front, 9% for back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **Lower Limbs:** Instead of 9% + 9%, it is 13.5% (6.75% for front, 6.75% for back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

#### Important Considerations

*   **Age:** Always consider if the patient is an adult or a child, as percentages differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **"Concentric" Burns:** If the word "concentric" is used in the question, it implies both the front and back of the body part are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. For example, concentric burns involving the thigh would be 5% (front) + 5% (back) = 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

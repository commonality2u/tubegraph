Dr. Rohan, who secured Rank 7 in the INIC November 2024 exam, shared his [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | exam strategy and mindset]] regarding Grand Tests (GTs) and overall exam approach.

## Role of Grand Tests (GTs) in Preparation

Dr. Rohan emphasized the critical role of GTs in refining his [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | preparation]] and understanding his performance.

### Experimentation and Strategy Refinement
Dr. Rohan approached each GT as an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. He would vary his attempt strategy in different GTs to see what worked best for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This included:
*   Attempting all MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>
*   Leaving all MCQs he had doubts about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>
*   Targeting attempts of more than 190 or 195 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>

After his May attempt, where he realized he hadn't practiced enough GTs or MCQs, Dr. Rohan committed to giving a GT every week from May until the end of October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Finalizing the Exam Strategy
Through consistent GT practice, Dr. Rohan finalized his [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | overall exam strategy]] towards the end of October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. It is recommended to have a clear exam strategy at least a month to a month and a half before the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

In the actual INIC exam, Dr. Rohan attempted 194 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, aligning with his GT-tested strategy of attempting over 190 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Mindset Towards GT Scores
Dr. Rohan strongly advised against taking GT scores too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. He has observed instances of "post GT depression" among peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> "GT is just a way of seeing that okay where you stand and how you can improve it does not reflect your final exam uh marks in any way so GT should be used as a tool to see where you're going on uh going around and how you can improve on your strategy and like don't dwell too much on the scores and ranks"

GTs should be seen as a tool for assessment and to [[role_of_reviewing_grand_test_gt_performances_in_preparation | improve strategy]], not as a definitive predictor of final exam performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## General Exam Strategy and Mindset

### Focus on MCQs and Question Banks
Dr. Rohan emphasized that competitive exams like INIC are primarily MCQ-based, testing one's ability to solve MCQs rather than just factual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

He advised aspiring students to focus extensively on [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | question banks]] rather than getting bogged down by excessive notes or rapid revision materials alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

### Importance of Discipline and Consistency
Dr. Rohan's success was also attributed to his discipline and consistency in completing the Marrow QBank, doing at least 10 modules a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. He, along with batchmates, held each other accountable to meet this daily target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This disciplined approach is crucial for achieving a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. It takes approximately 36 to 38 days for a habit to form, and initial resistance to daily tasks like solving 10 modules eventually gives way to routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Bookmarks and Custom Modules
Dr. Rohan implemented a multi-tiered bookmarking strategy to facilitate revision:
*   **Bookmark Type 1:** Recent NEET and AIIMS questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
*   **Bookmark Type 2:** Incorrect MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>
*   **Bookmark Type 3:** MCQs where he was confused between two options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> (especially common in INIC where options can be very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>).

In addition to his daily 10 modules, he would solve three or four [[custom_module_and_gt_analysis_for_exam_preparation | custom modules]] composed solely of his bookmarked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This allowed for continuous revision of important and challenging questions, aiding in space repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This strategy helped in [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | improving GT scores over time]] and efficiently reducing the number of bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Utilizing Pearls for Quick Revision
During the final 10 days of his [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | exam preparation]], Dr. Rohan utilized the "Pearls" feature in Marrow, particularly those he had bookmarked from incorrect MCQs or important previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Pearls serve as a great tool for a quick overview of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

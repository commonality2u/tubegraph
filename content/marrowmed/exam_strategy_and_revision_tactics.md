Dr. Shashwat, who secured Rank 2 in the INICT exam, shared his comprehensive [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | preparation strategy]] and [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | study and revision techniques]]. He emphasized a planned and focused approach throughout his academic journey, adapting his methods from initial study to the final days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Preparation: Third Year Strategy

Dr. Shashwat began his preparation with Marrow at the start of his third professional year, Part 1, in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Subject Coverage
He first completed all third-year subjects, including [[ent_exam_questions_and_strategies | ENT]], Ophthalmology, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. His goal was to watch two to three videos daily after college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Within two to three days of watching videos, he would self-revise the notes for those subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

By the end of his third year, he had completed:
*   All third-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Surgery and OBG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Half of the short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This approach is a typical strategy, allowing students to finish 15-20% of final year subjects early to reduce burden in the final year and allow more time for [[the_role_of_focused_study_and_revision_in_competitive_exams | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Notes Strategy: Handmade vs. Printed
Dr. Shashwat preferred handmade notes for major subjects like Surgery, OBG, and Medicine, citing better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While making handmade notes took more time (pausing videos to copy explanations), the retention was significantly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For subjects in his final year and internship where time was limited, he used printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He affirmed that making handmade notes is worthwhile if there is sufficient time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### QBank Integration
He performed questions (QBank) simultaneously with video watching and note revision for some subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For major subjects, he completed the QBank during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Solving questions reinforced the subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Internship Approach

Internship at MAMC was described as strenuous and tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Study Focus During Internship
*   **Initial focus**: Completing leftover subjects from the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Lighter postings**: Utilized for completing first and second professional subjects that hadn't been thoroughly studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He watched Biochemistry videos during metro travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Post-heavy postings**: Shifted focus to revising main notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Some [[effective_revision_tactics_for_medical_exams | revision notes]] were used in the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Consistent practice**: QBank and Test & Discussion (T&D) questions were a continuous focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Typical Day (Heavy vs. Light Posting)
*   **Heavy Posting (e.g., Medicine, OBG)**: During day duty, he used the app on his phone to solve QBank questions, review notes, or check pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In the evenings, depending on fatigue, he would try to study something to ensure the day wasn't wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Light Posting**: Utilized travel time (metro) for QBank or watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. After postings, he would study in the college room or library, and revise handmade notes in the evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He aimed to solve QBank for revised subjects within one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This showcased a perfect utilization of time, especially travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Dealing with Edition Changes and FOMO

Dr. Shashwat advised against the fear of missing out (FOMO) regarding new editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   He checked faculty updates for major changes or recent updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   For subjects with many updates, like PSM, he would review the revision notes or main notes from the new edition, but not necessarily watch all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   He primarily focused on what he had studied earlier, believing concepts largely remain the same with only minor updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   New updates would also eventually be covered in the question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## QBank Utilization and Strategy

### Targets and Review
He set a target of achieving at least 80% (preferably 90%) correct answers in the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He thoroughly read all explanations, especially for incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. After completing a module, he would filter and review only the incorrect questions and their explanations, including all options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This process aided in [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | revision]] and prevented repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### When to Revisit Notes
If he consistently scored low (e.g., below 65%) in two or three consecutive modules of a particular subject (e.g., GI Surgery), he would go back and revise the entire subject's notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Otherwise, for occasional low scores (outliers or difficult modules), he relied solely on the QBank explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Bookmark Strategy
He focused on bookmarked questions towards the end of his internship, particularly for subjects where he had marked questions due to incorrect answers or unfamiliar topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   He prioritized bookmarked questions for long subjects like Medicine and Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   He removed questions from his bookmark list once he consistently answered them correctly, to filter the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   He bookmarked questions that more than 30% of applicants had gotten right, avoiding overly difficult "experimental" questions with very low correctness rates (less than 25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Volume of Questions
*   During internship, he averaged around 50 QBank questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   In the two to three months before the exam, this volume increased significantly to 100-125 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) Strategy

Dr. Shashwat started giving GTs during his internship, regretting that he hadn't started them earlier in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Initially, he gave one GT every two weeks, increasing to one GT every week closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Review**: He reviewed skipped, wrong, and guessed questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Even if a guess was correct, he reviewed it to ensure understanding and prevent relying on luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs were crucial for identifying weaker subjects, which then became the focus of his study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Dealing with Performance Plateaus/Dips
*   He experienced performance dips in his GTs, which initially demotivated him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   However, he reframed these dips as opportunities to identify and focus on weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. For instance, he didn't revise [[ent_exam_questions_and_strategies | ENT]] in the last six months because he consistently scored well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Conversely, subjects like Physiology and Anatomy were consistently weaker, so he focused more on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   He would give the test in the evening, review it, sleep over it, and start the next day fresh, focusing on what to learn from the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This approach of letting go and refocusing is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Final Stages of Preparation (Last Month & Last Week)

### Last One Month Strategy
With internship completed, he focused on:
*   Subjects identified as weaker by GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   Prioritizing Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry in the first one to two weeks, as these are often neglected but carry significant weightage in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
*   Continuously studying Medicine and Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   Deciding his weekly study plan based on GT performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

### Last One Week Strategy
*   Mainly focused on [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   Specific focus on Anatomy and the statistics part of Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   Revising subjects not studied in the last three months or those that were slightly weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   Crucially, staying calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   Reviewing Previous Year Questions (PYQs), as many were direct or similar questions were asked in different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Strategies for Maximizing Exam Performance

### During the Exam
*   The INICT exam was described as tricky and unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   Dr. Shashwat attempted 196 questions, a similar number to his GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   He emphasized that GTs serve as the practice ground, and the strategy followed in GTs should be replicated in the actual exam to avoid anxiety and mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Advice for 20 Days Before NEET Exam
If preparing for NEET with 20 days remaining, Dr. Shashwat advised:
*   Completing or reviewing NEET PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   Making notes of all wrong PYQ questions and revising them every two to three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   Stagging off questions once they are consistently answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
*   Focusing on weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   Giving a GT every 5 days to decide the focus for the next study block based on weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   Prioritizing subjects with lesser weightage in INIC but more in NEET, such as the entirety of Community Medicine (beyond just stats), FMT, or Psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   For custom modules, use tags like PQ, NEET, Clinical Questions, Difficulty-based, and Image-based questions (IBQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

## Utility of Pearls
Pearls were useful for quick revision of topics not thoroughly revised or for scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Specifically, pearls that appeared after QBank questions were beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. He reviewed them along with explanations, especially focusing on scoring systems which are frequently asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

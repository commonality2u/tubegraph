This article discusses a case scenario of an elderly female presenting with uncontrolled diabetes and various associated symptoms, leading to the diagnosis of a rare neuroendocrine tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Patient Presentation
A 63-year-old female presented with a four-year history of uncontrolled diabetes, which is considered unusual as Type 2 diabetes is typically diagnosed earlier in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Her symptoms included an ulcerating rash on the shin, groin, and face, as well as skeltis and glossitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These symptoms had worsened over four years despite specialized wound care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Concurrently, she experienced severe weight loss, abdominal pain, and intractable nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The patient also showed signs of zinc deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. There was no mention of typical diabetes complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis of Diabetes
When diagnosing diabetes, it is crucial to determine the underlying pathology, not just the hyperglycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Type 1 Diabetes:** Definitely not Type 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Type 2 Diabetes:** Very unlikely to be Type 2, as resistance features typically start much earlier, and diagnosis at 60 years old is uncommon for Type 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If it were a benign Type 4, it wouldn't have end-stage macro or micro complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **[[presentation_and_diagnosis_of_secondary_diabetes_causes | Secondary Diabetes Causes]]:** Given the patient's age, short history of uncontrolled diabetes, and skin lesions, a secondary cause for diabetes is highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Common Secondary Causes of Diabetes
*   **Hemochromatosis:** Can manifest with diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **IgG4-related disease:** Can cause pancreatic diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Carcinoma of the Pancreas (CA Pancreas):** Important in the elderly, can present with diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs):** A very important consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Neuroendocrine Tumors and Diabetes
*   **Somatostatinoma:**
    *   Can cause diabetes, but it's typically mild due to somatostatin inhibiting glucagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   Often associated with neurofibromatosis one (NF1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   Mostly arises from the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Classic triad: diabetes, cholelithiasis, and steatorrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Does not typically produce skin lesions, which rules it out in this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Glucagonoma:**
    *   Highly likely in this case given the rapid onset of uncontrolled diabetes and skin lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   A type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Glucagonoma: The Likely Diagnosis
Glucagonoma typically originates from the body and tail of the pancreas, where alpha cells are dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It often presents as a solitary, large lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Clinical Manifestations: The 5Ds and W
Glucagonoma is characterized by the "5Ds and W" mnemonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:
1.  **Diabetes mellitus:** Rapidly worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
2.  **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** Patients are prone to thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
3.  **Depression:** Can be a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
4.  **Diarrhea:** Often present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
5.  **Dermatitis:** Specifically, [[diabetic_retinopathy_complications | Necrolytic Migratory Erythema (NME)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
6.  **Weight loss (W):** A very important characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Pathophysiology of Weight Loss and Zinc Deficiency
*   **Weight Loss:** Caused by amino acids being utilized to form glucose, leading to hypoaminoacidemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Patients appear frail, fragile, and lack muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This metabolic state resembles [[marasmus_metabolic_state | marasmus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Occurs due to hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is a carrier of zinc, and with protein malnutrition, there is insufficient albumin to transport zinc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Glucagonoma Triad:** Necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, and abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   Glossitis, cheilitis, and depression can also be features, possibly linked to acrodermatitis enteropathica (due to zinc deficiency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## General Characteristics of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)
NETs are now classified as either neuroendocrine tumors (well-differentiated) or neuroendocrine carcinomas (poorly differentiated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. They are also known as carcinoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Classification by Origin
*   **Foregut Carcinoids:** Arise from the thymus; aggressive with poor prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Midgut Carcinoids:** Most common, arising from the pancreas; have a very poor prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Hindgut Carcinoids:** Mostly from the rectum; extremely benign, often incidentally detected, and have a good prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Associated Syndromes
NETs can be associated with several genetic syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>:
*   MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   MEN4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Tuberous Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>

### Common Pancreatic NETs
*   **Insulinoma:** Most common pancreatic NET overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Prognosis is generally good, but can be worse when part of MEN syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Gastrinoma:** Most common functional pancreatic NET in MEN1 and MEN4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Sporadic gastrinomas have a poor prognosis with high metastasis rates (50-60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. MEN-associated gastrinomas tend to be smaller, more numerous, and have a better prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Suspect sporadic gastrinoma with recurrent/refractory gastric ulcers, abdominal pain, and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Carcinoid Syndrome
NETs can produce large amounts of serotonin, kallikrein, bradykinin, and histamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. These substances cause [[understanding_common_conditions_related_to_endocrinology | carcinoid syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Manifestations
*   **Flushing:** Primarily due to kallikrein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Bronchospasm:** Mostly due to histamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Diarrhea:** Mostly due to serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Prognostic Significance of Carcinoid Syndrome
In midgut or pancreatic NETs, these effectors are released into the portal circulation and cleared by the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Therefore, the appearance of carcinoid syndrome manifestations (flushing, bronchospasm, diarrhea) in a pancreatic NET indicates hepatic metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Thymic carcinoids, however, release effectors directly into systemic circulation and more readily cause carcinoid syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Associated Complications
*   **Niacin Deficiency:** Tryptophan, a precursor for niacin, is diverted to form serotonin, leading to niacin deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Cardiac Involvement:** The most important complication is right-sided cardiac involvement, leading to right-sided heart failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Valvular Disease:** The most common valvular disease is tricuspid vegetation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Investigation and Management
*   **Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy (SRS):** The investigation of choice for almost all pancreatic NETs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS):** Better for detecting insulinomas and small gastrinomas (especially those associated with MEN1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Surgery:** Often attempted, but frequently not possible due to metastasis by the time of diagnosis, especially for tumors like glucagonoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

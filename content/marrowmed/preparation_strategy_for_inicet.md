Despite securing a PG seat in pediatrics at AIIMS Delhi previously, he decided to leave it, confident in his ability to achieve a better outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His [[journey_and_strategy_for_inicet_preparation | journey and strategy for INICET preparation]] highlights focused effort over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Approach to [[inicet_exam_preparation_strategies | INICET Exam Preparation Strategies]]

Dr. Phillip began his intense [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation strategy for INICET]] for the May 2025 exam only in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Given the limited time, his primary focus was on maximizing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Core Resources and Their Usage
His main resources were the question bank and test series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He primarily used the question bank to shorten the revision duration, finding it more efficient than main videos for quick preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   **Question Bank**: He solved approximately 700 to 720 question bank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   **Sufficiency**: He noted that while the question bank isn't equivalent to main videos, it is sufficient when time is limited, as it includes explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Initial Phase**: He completed the question bank modules subject-wise in the initial phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Bookmarking**: He bookmarked questions he found difficult or perceived as important for the [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Initially, he bookmarked around 3,000 questions, which he later reduced to 500-600 after reviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   **Timeline**: He completed the first revision of about 500 modules in two to two and a half months (January and February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules**: From March onwards, his main strategy involved reviewing all wrongly answered questions and creating custom modules of mixed questions from all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This allowed him to revise all subjects simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Main Videos**: For tricky questions or unclear concepts, especially in first-year subjects like Anatomy and Biochemistry, he resorted to the main videos to clear his doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Strategy
Grand Tests were an integral part of his [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation strategy]] for [[strategies_for_preparing_for_fmge_and_inicet_exams | INICET exams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Starting GTs**: He began giving GTs after completing about six to eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Score Progression**: Initially, his scores were around 130-135, with a rank of 8,000-9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. His last GT score was 170 correct questions, achieving a rank of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Initially, he gave GTs once every 10-12 days, then increased to once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Review Process**: He reviewed GTs on the same day or the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    1.  Skipped questions (no idea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    2.  Wrongly answered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    3.  Questions answered by eliminating options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Using Analytics**: He used GT graphs and analytics to check his progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **Progress Monitoring**: He understood that scores might drop but will rise again with correct preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   **Identifying Weaknesses**: He used the graphs to identify his bottom five subjects and revised them thoroughly before the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Magic Modules**: Useful for compiling questions answered incorrectly for focused review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Drug metabolism is a critical process by which the body breaks down and processes pharmaceutical agents and other foreign substances (xenobiotics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This process typically occurs in two main phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Phase One Reactions

In Phase One, the primary action is the breakdown of the drug molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Simultaneously, a functional group is attached to the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The purpose of introducing this functional group is to prepare the drug for subsequent metabolism in Phase Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Phase Two Reactions (Conjugation)

Phase Two is also known as "conjugation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In this phase, a conjugate molecule is attached to the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The functional group introduced in Phase One is essential for binding to this conjugate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

The conjugate is always negatively charged, which makes the entire drug molecule in Phase Two become negatively charged or ionized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This ionization increases the drug's water solubility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Increased water solubility is crucial for the efficient excretion of the drug from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Summary of Phases
*   **Phase One:** Breaks down the drug and attaches a functional group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Phase Two:** Makes the drug water-soluble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Clinical Relevance

Understanding these phases is important for predicting [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | drug interactions and toxicities]]. For example, carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic, can cause cerebellar toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. When erythromycin, an [[mechanism_of_action_of_specific_pharmaceutical_agents | enzyme inhibitor]], is administered concurrently, it inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This inhibition leads to increased levels of carbamazepine, raising the risk of cerebellar toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

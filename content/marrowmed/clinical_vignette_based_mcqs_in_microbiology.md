From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The NEET 2024 exam featured [[microbiology_mcqs_from_inicet_november_2024 | microbiology MCQs]] that were predominantly clinical vignette-based, with some including images to aid in answering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The questions were generally of moderate difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Assessment of MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

*   **Format**: Most questions were clinical vignette-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A few included images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Difficulty**: The difficulty level was moderate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Thorough knowledge from microbiology notes or videos would have allowed students to answer all questions correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Novelty**: The questions were mostly new, with no direct previous year questions (PYQs) in microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Around 50% of the questions were from previously asked topics (last 5 years), but the rest were entirely new topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This emphasizes that relying solely on PYQs is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## General Exam Advice

Staying calm and composed during the exam is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Disclaimer

The questions discussed are compiled based on student recall, meaning there might be some discrepancies in wording or options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Contributions to clarify any discrepancies are encouraged in the video comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Exam Sessions

The NEET 2024 exam had two sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Comparing the two sessions is difficult as only one topic was repeated, and questions were generally different between Session 1 and Session 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Both sessions were considered equally difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Notable Clinical Vignettes and Concepts

### Typhoid Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

*   **Case**: A young man with frequent outside eating, presenting with daily increasing fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pink macules on the trunk, and bradycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Key Signs**:
    *   **Faget Sign**: Fever with bradycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   **Rose Spots**: Pink macules on the trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**: Blood culture is the best investigation in the first week of symptoms, being positive in over 90% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Widal test antibodies appear in the second week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   Urine culture is useful around the fourth week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Stool culture is useful around the third week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* (Kanagawa Phenomenon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

*   **Case**: Patient with a history of oyster consumption, experiencing nausea, vomiting, and crampy abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Stool culture isolate shows hemolysis in high-salt human blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Key Concept**:
    *   **Wagatsuma Agar**: Human blood agar with added salt, used for *Vibrio* species (alkaliphiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Association**: *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* is associated with seafood ingestion and presents as invasive enteritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Other Seafood-Associated Organisms**: *Vibrio vulnificus* (septicemia) and Norovirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Biofilm in Catheter-Related Infection (*Staphylococcus epidermidis*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

*   **Key Concept**: Biofilms are polysaccharide layers (slime) formed around bacterial colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Role of Biofilm**:
    *   Increases resistance to antibiotics by acting as a mechanical barrier, preventing antibiotic entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Aids in adhesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Protects from bacteriophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Management**: The catheter must be removed when biofilm-forming bacteria like *Staphylococcus epidermidis* cause persistent infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Notorious Biofilm-Forming Bacteria**: *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, *Streptococcus mutans*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis**: Perianal swab (NIH swab) is used; stool examination is not productive for eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Egg Morphology**: Plano-convex egg with folded larva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Case**: A group of boys consumed hamburgers, and 3 days later, some developed abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. One was diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Stool cultures identified *E. coli* O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
*   **Identity**: Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.
*   **Antigen Notation**:
    *   **H antigen**: Flagellar antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
    *   **O antigen**: Somatic antigen, part of the LPS (endotoxin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Clinical Significance**: *E. coli* O157:H7 is the most dangerous EHEC isolate, often associated with HUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
*   **Special Medium**: Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (SMAC) where *E. coli* O157:H7 does not ferment sorbitol and produces pale-colored colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

### Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-Azar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>

*   **Case**: A 30-year-old male from Bihar presents with high-grade fever (off and on) and abdominal swelling for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. Examination shows marked pallor and massive splenomegaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Identity**: Kala-Azar (Visceral Leishmaniasis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.
*   **Vector**: *Phlebotomus* (Sandfly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### Acanthamoeba Keratitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>

*   **Case**: A young female contact lens user presents with severe itching, watering, and redness of the eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. She is not regular with changing her contact lens solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Microscopy of the solution shows motile structures with spine-like pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Identity**: *Acanthamoeba* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Key Feature**: Spine-like pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Association**: Strongly associated with contact lens use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Distinction**: Other free-living amoebae like *Balamuthia* and *Naegleria fowleri* are mentioned but are not typically associated with contact lens keratitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

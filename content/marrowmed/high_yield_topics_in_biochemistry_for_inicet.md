From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The biochemistry session for the INICET November 2024 exam featured questions that included direct repeats and topics from high-yield areas. Dr. Rebecca James noted that questions like Menkes disease and the diabetes-related hormone-sensitive lipase/lipoprotein lipase question were direct repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## General High-Yield Topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

Several questions were drawn from consistently high-yield topics:
*   Electron transport chain inhibitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Recombinant DNA technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Derivatives of amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

A new topic that emerged as potentially high-yield for biochemistry is pre-analytical errors, which had not been previously asked in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Additionally, some questions on the color coding of vacutainers were shared between biochemistry and [[Detailed Pathology Topics for INICT and NEET | pathology]] sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Most questions were one-liners, with a few scenario-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Detailed High-Yield Topics

### Urea Cycle Disorders and Ammonia Scavenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

In cases of urea cycle disorders, where ammonia detoxification is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, acylation therapy is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Ammonia Handling**: Amino groups from catabolized alpha-amino acids are concentrated as a non-toxic form called glutamate via transamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Glutamate is then transported as glutamine to the liver, where it's converted back to glutamate, releasing ammonia for the urea cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Glutamate dehydrogenase also releases ammonia that enters the urea cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Phenylbutyrate Treatment**: Phenylbutyrate is a prodrug metabolized to phenylacetate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Phenylacetate combines with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted in urine, thus scavenging ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. If glutamine is not an option, glutamate can be chosen as it contributes to glutamine formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Sodium Benzoate Treatment**: Sodium benzoate combines with glycine to form hippuric acid (benzoylglycine), which is excreted in urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This forces the body to synthesize more glycine, which in turn uses up excess ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Techniques for Detecting Chromosomal Aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

Several techniques can detect aneuploidy:
*   **Conventional Cytogenetics**: Karyotyping using G-banding technique has high diagnostic accuracy (99.4-99.8% in amniotic fluid, 97.5-99.6% in chorionic villus sampling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Its limitation is lower resolution compared to newer methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Molecular Cytogenetics**:
    *   **Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)**: A better technique than conventional karyotyping, circumventing its resolution limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   **Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) / Array CGH**: A microarray-based technique that can reveal imbalances across the entire genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Rapid Aneuploidy Detection (RAD)**:
    *   **Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR) / Real-time PCR**: Offers rapid detection of aneuploidy, is less expensive than FISH, and allows simultaneous processing of larger samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   **Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)**: A technique to detect gene dosage, including aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Sanger Sequencing**: Simple Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect aneuploidy as it sequences oligonucleotide fragments, not entire chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. However, if its principle is adapted to a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (also known as massive parallel sequencing), then detection of aneuploidy is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: A technique where entire chromosomes can be sequenced in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Amino Acid Precursors and Derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>

Knowing the precursors for various important biological molecules is a common topic:
*   **Melatonin**: Derived from Tryptophan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>
*   **Histamine**: Derived from Histidine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>
*   **Norepinephrine**: A catecholamine derived from Tyrosine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>
*   **Glutathione**: Composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, with the sulfhydryl (SH) group coming from Cysteine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>

### Copper Deficiency and Lysyl Oxidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>

This is a frequently tested topic across various exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Lysyl oxidase** requires copper as a cofactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. It is crucial for the formation of covalent cross-links in collagen synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Menkes disease** is caused by a defect in the *ATP7A* gene, which affects a copper transporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This leads to a functional copper deficiency, even with adequate dietary intake, as copper cannot enter the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Consequently, copper-dependent enzymes like lysyl oxidase are affected, impacting collagen cross-linking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Menkes disease is also known as kinky or steely hair syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Diabetes Mellitus and Lipid Metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>

In diabetes mellitus, the liver produces more triacylglycerol and VLDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   **Insulin's Role**: In a well-fed state, a high insulin/glucagon ratio favors endogenous synthesis of triacylglycerol, which is carried by VLDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
    *   Insulin promotes **lipoprotein lipase (LPL)** activity, converting mature VLDL to remnant VLDL, allowing fatty acids to be deposited and stored as triacylglycerol in adipose tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    *   Insulin inhibits **hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)**, preventing the release of stored triacylglycerol from adipose tissue into the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **In Diabetes Mellitus**: Due to insulin deficiency or resistance:
    *   **Decreased LPL action**: VLDL conversion to remnant VLDL is impaired, leading to accumulation of mature VLDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
    *   **Increased HSL action**: Inhibition of HSL is lifted, leading to activation of HSL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This results in the release of stored triacylglycerol from adipose tissue as free fatty acids into the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   The combined effect leads to elevated blood free fatty acids and mature VLDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Enzymes in Recombinant DNA Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>

This is a recurring high-yield topic, with new enzymes often added to the list in updated textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. The latest Harper's edition includes Crispr-Cas9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **Phosphatase**: Removes 5' phosphate groups, enabling labeling with radiolabeled phosphates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Terminal Transferase**: Used for homopolymer tailing, adding nucleotides to blunt ends created by restriction endonucleases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Crispr-Cas9**: An RNA-guided DNA endonuclease (Cas9) that can cut DNA within a sequence, similar to restriction endonucleases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. It is used for genome editing and has therapeutic applications, such as treating sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia (e.g., Casgevy drug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
It's essential to learn the names of these enzymes and their primary uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

### Electron Transport Chain Inhibitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>

Cytochrome C oxidase (Complex IV) in the electron transport chain can be blocked by various gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
*   **Inhibitors**: Carbon monoxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, cyanide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>, and hydrogen sulfide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Inhibitor**: Nitric oxide is a therapeutic agent with various bodily functions and is not an electron transport chain inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Pre-analytical Errors in Serum Calcium Estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>

Calcium estimation is highly susceptible to pre-analytical errors, mostly increasing total blood calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Measures to prevent these errors include:
*   **Tourniquet Use and Venous Occlusion**: These cause venous stasis, leading to water expulsion from the vascular space and an increase in protein-bound calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. If a tourniquet must be used, it should be tied just before drawing the sample and released immediately (max 60 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   **Changes in Posture**: Standing increases calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **Exercise and Fist Clenching**: These increase lactic acid, leading to acidosis, which can increase protein-bound calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Immobilization and Bed Rest**: Can increase calcium levels due to osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Hyperventilation**: Also increases calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   **Anticoagulants**: The right anticoagulant is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Heparin is generally suitable, but lyophilized heparin is preferable over liquid heparin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Anticoagulants like EDTA, citrate, and oxalate should be avoided as they chelate calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

All these factors are possible causes of pre-analytical errors and should be prevented when collecting blood samples for accurate serum calcium estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

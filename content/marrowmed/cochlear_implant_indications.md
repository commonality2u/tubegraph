Cochlear implants are surgical devices that replace the function of the organ of Corti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. They are indicated for individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, regardless of whether the hearing loss is congenital or acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Types of Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss can be classified into two main types:

*   **Prelingual Hearing Loss** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>: This refers to congenital hearing loss where a child is born deaf and has never learned to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Congenital hearing loss is a valid indication for [[cochlear_implants_and_parts_identification | cochlear implants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Postlingual Hearing Loss** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>: This type of hearing loss develops after language acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It can affect children, adults, or the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Causes can include:
    *   Following meningitis, leading to labyrinthitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   Ototoxicity, such as aminoglycoside-induced profound hearing loss, where drugs damage the outer and inner hair cells of the organ of Corti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
    *   Presbycusis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Sudden sensorineural hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Specific Scenarios
*   **Cochlear Otosclerosis**: While general otosclerosis typically causes conductive hearing loss, cochlear otosclerosis can result in sensorineural hearing loss that may be profound, making it a potential indication for [[cochlear_implants_and_parts_identification | cochlear implant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Conditions Not Indicated for Cochlear Implants
Cochlear implants are not typically indicated for conditions causing conductive hearing loss, as they do not address the issue of sound conduction.

*   **Otosclerosis**: This condition primarily causes conductive hearing loss, which is managed with stapedotomy rather than a [[cochlear_implants_and_parts_identification | cochlear implant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Congenital Malleus Fixation**: This leads to conductive hearing loss and is managed through ossiculoplasty, not [[cochlear_implants_and_parts_identification | cochlear implant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

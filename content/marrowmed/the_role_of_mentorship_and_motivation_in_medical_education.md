[[The role of mentorship and motivation in medical education]]

Motivation is a crucial factor in achieving success in medical entrance examinations, particularly when faced with setbacks or challenging preparation periods. The insights shared by Dr. Ravi, who secured Rank 3 in the INI exam, highlight how internal drive, external influences, and effective strategies contribute to maintaining motivation.

### Overcoming Setbacks and Maintaining Focus
Dr. Ravi initially missed his dream of securing a spot in medicine by a mere two ranks in a previous SC exam, having a rank of 43 when medicine closed at 41 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Despite this, he "fought back hard," securing Rank 5 in NEET PG and subsequently Rank 3 in the November INI exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This demonstrates resilience and a strong drive to achieve his goal.

His decision to take the INI exam, despite already having a NEET PG rank that would secure medicine, was influenced by delayed NEET PG counseling and a social media "reel" suggesting that INI counseling might happen sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The mindset of having "nothing to lose" and receiving encouragement from a senior also motivated him to fill out the INI form on the very last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The lack of pressure, having already secured a good NEET PG rank, allowed him to approach the INI exam with an open mind, which he believes contributed to his unexpected Rank 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### The Role of Mentorship and Inspirational Teaching
Mentorship and inspirational teaching play a significant [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | role]] in shaping a medical student's career path and maintaining their motivation. Dr. Ravi credits Dr. Rakesh's videos for pushing him towards the field of medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He found Dr. Rakesh's way of explaining topics to be "completely on different level," especially how he approached topics from a "patient-oriented way" and an "internal medicine person's view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This holistic and engaging teaching style inspired him profoundly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Strategies for Maintaining Consistency
During a demanding internship, maintaining consistency in [[Importance of solving MCQs in medical exams | MCQ]] practice can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Dr. Ravi treated solving MCQs as a daily challenge, aiming for a minimum of four or five modules per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His approach was to solve MCQs immediately after reading a topic, which helped reinforce the information and prevent forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Addressing Stagnation in Grand Test Scores
Dr. Ravi experienced phases where his Grand Test (GT) scores stagnated, particularly around 150 correct questions for three to four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. He realized his mistake was postponing certain subjects, like Community Medicine, which were his weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. By focusing on these weak subjects and topics frequently asked in GTs, his scores improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The advice derived from this experience is to "face your demons" or weak subjects early in the preparation, rather than delaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Final Advice: Importance of Revision and Grand Tests
Dr. Ravi's parting wisdom emphasizes the critical role of revision in medical entrance examinations. He states that deep study of a single subject matters less than the number of times one has revised the entire syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Since a large portion of medicine is factual, frequent revision is necessary to recall information under exam stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. He also highlights that Grand Tests are "literally irreplaceable" and that not taking them means "not going in the right direction" with preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

Dr. Shashwat, who secured Rank 2 in the INICT exam, shares his strategy for effectively utilizing question banks and Grand Tests (GTs) throughout his preparation, from third year of medical school through internship and leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Integrating Question Banks in Early Preparation

Dr. Shashwat began his Marrow journey at the start of his third year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His approach to [[importance_of_using_a_qbank_for_exam_preparation | Q banks]] during this phase was as follows:
*   **Simultaneous Practice:** For some subjects, he engaged with the [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | Q bank]] simultaneously with watching videos and revising notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This practice is crucial for reinforcing understanding of the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Future Reinforcement:** He noted that the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | Q bank]] could be reset and revisited during internship, further aiding the revision process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Internship Strategy: QBank and Grand Tests

During his internship, particularly at MAMC where it was very strenuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, Dr. Shashwat adapted his study strategy to incorporate [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Q banks]] and Test & Question Series (TQS) consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### QBank Use During Internship
*   **Completing Uncovered Subjects:** He initially focused on completing subjects he hadn't yet studied by practicing questions from the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | Q bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Travel Time:** For lighter postings, he used his commute time (e.g., on the metro) to do [[utilizing_digital_tools_and_q_banks_for_exam_preparation | Q bank]] questions or watch videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This was a "perfect utilization of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Daily Volume:** During internship, he typically solved around 50 questions per day from the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | Q bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This volume increased to 100-125 questions per day in the 2-3 months leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) Strategy
Dr. Shashwat started taking Grand Tests relatively late, during the second half of his internship, after his heavy postings ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. He regretted starting late and wished he had begun in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

Key aspects of his GT strategy:
*   **Frequency:** Initially, he took one GT every two weeks, which increased to one GT every week closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Review Process:** He reviewed the skipped, wrong, and guessed questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Guessed questions were reviewed even if correct, as they might have been "tuka" (luck) and not guaranteed correct in a real exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Identifying Weaknesses:** GTs were crucial for identifying weaker subjects, allowing him to focus his study efforts on those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, for example, shifting focus to Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry due to their weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Exam Strategy:** He followed a similar strategy in GTs as he did in the actual exam, attempting around 196 questions in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This consistency helps prevent anxiety and mistakes on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

## QBank Utilization: A Deeper Dive

Dr. Shashwat approached the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | Q bank]] as both a target-setting and learning tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Accuracy Target:** He aimed for at least 80% correct answers, preferably 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Explanation Review:** He thoroughly read all explanations, especially for incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. He filtered for incorrect questions to save time and focus on those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Reviewing explanations for all options helped in revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Revisiting Notes:** If he consistently scored low (e.g., below 65% for two or three modules in a subject like GI Surgery), he would go back and revise the entire subject's notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For isolated low scores or difficult modules, he relied primarily on [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | Q bank]] explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Bookmarked Questions
*   **Later Focus:** He didn't focus on bookmarked questions initially but started reviewing them subject-wise towards the end of his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Strategic Bookmarking:** He bookmarked questions he got wrong or didn't understand the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Filtering:** He removed questions from his bookmarks once he consistently got them correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He also advised against bookmarking extremely difficult questions (less than 25-30% correct rate among test-takers) to avoid an unmanageably long list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The focus should be on questions the majority get correct but you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Dealing with Performance Dips in Grand Tests

When performance dipped in GTs, Dr. Shashwat's strategy was to:
*   **Maintain Motivation:** Despite feeling demotivated, he kept focusing, viewing dips not as failures but as indicators of weak subjects and focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Study:** He used GT results to decide which subjects needed more attention. For example, consistently performing well in ENT meant he didn't need to study it in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, while weaker subjects like Physiology or Anatomy received more focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Emotional Management:** He would take the test in the evening, review it, "sleep over it," and start fresh the next day, focusing only on what to learn from the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This helped him avoid brooding over past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

## Last Month/Week Before the Exam

*   **Prioritize Weak Areas:** In the last month, after internship ended, he focused on subjects where he was weaker based on GT analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This included often-neglected first-year subjects like Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry due to their consistent weightage in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Last Week Focus:** In the last week, he focused on overall revision, particularly Anatomy and the statistics part of Community Medicine, and other subjects that were slightly weaker or hadn't been revised in the past three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** He emphasized the importance of PYQs, even if initially answered incorrectly. Repeating them and understanding the concepts ensures they are answered confidently in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Advice for Specific Exam Phases (e.g., 20 days before NEET)

For students with 20 days remaining until an exam like NEET, Dr. Shashwat advises:
*   **Complete and Review PYQs:** Finish all PYQs, reviewing those answered incorrectly and revising them every 2-3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Remove questions from the list once consistently answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Target Weak Subjects:** Continue focusing on weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Frequent GTs:** Take a GT every 5 days to assess progress and decide which subjects to focus on in the next study block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Address Exam-Specific Weightage:** Focus on subjects that might have higher weightage in a specific exam (e.g., entire Community Medicine for NEET, unlike INIC where only statistics is more emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>, or parts of FMT/Psychiatry that are more relevant for NEET than INIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>).
*   **Custom QBank Modules:** When creating custom modules, use tags like PQ (Previous Questions), Clinical Questions, Difficulty-based, and IBQ (Image-Based Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

## Utility of Pearls

Pearls were found useful for:
*   **Quick Revision:** Especially for topics not extensively revised or for scoring concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Post-Question Review:** Pearls that appeared alongside explanations in the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | Q bank]] after a question were particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. This allowed for quick review of important scores or other key facts without needing to open notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

This comprehensive approach to [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | question banks and Grand Tests]] enabled Dr. Shashwat to achieve his top rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

Germ layer formation is a fundamental process in [[general_embryology | general embryology]] known as gastrulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This event, along with neurulation, occurs during the third week of embryonic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Initiation of Gastrulation

The beginning of gastrulation is indicated by the formation of the primitive streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The primitive streak is a structure formed at the caudal end of the embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   It develops from the proliferation of epiblast cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   The primitive streak typically forms by the end of the second week or the beginning of the third week (around the 14th or 15th day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Sequence of Germ Layer Development

All three germ layers originate from the epiblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The sequence of their formation is:

1.  **Endoderm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
    *   The endoderm is the first germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   It forms from the epiblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   The endoderm replaces all the hypoblast cells, meaning that from the third week onwards, hypoblast is no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

2.  **Mesoderm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
    *   The mesoderm is the second germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   It is derived from the primitive streak, which itself originates from the epiblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

3.  **Ectoderm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    *   The ectoderm is the last, or third, germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   It is formed from the remaining epiblast cells after the endoderm and mesoderm have developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The correct sequence of germ layer formation is endoderm, mesoderm, and then ectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

This article discusses the arterial and nerve supply to the leg, drawing insights from recent anatomy examinations, particularly focusing on structures passing around the ankle and the innervation of key leg and thigh muscles.

## Arterial Supply of the Leg

### Posterior Tibial Artery
The posterior tibial artery is a significant vessel in the leg.
*   **Location**: It is present behind the medial malleolus and approximately 2 cm in front of the tendo calcaneus (Achilles tendon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.
*   **Pulsation**: Its pulsation can be felt between the medial malleolus and the tendocalcaneus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Clinical Relevance**: This artery can be used for shunting with the great saphenous vein for hemodialysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

### Structures Behind the Medial Malleolus
Structures passing below the flexor retinaculum of the leg, behind the medial malleolus, can be remembered with the mnemonic "Tom Dumbledore and Harry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>:
*   **T**: Tibialis posterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>
*   **D**: Flexor digitorum longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>
*   **A**: Artery (posterior tibial artery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>
*   **N**: Nerve (tibial nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>
*   **H**: Flexor hallucis longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>

## Nerve Supply of the Leg and Related Thigh Muscles

### Nerves of the Thigh Compartments
*   **Anterior compartment of thigh**: Muscles supplied by the femoral nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.
*   **Middle compartment of thigh**: Muscles supplied by the obturator nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:40">[03:33:40]</a>.
*   **Posterior compartment of thigh (Hamstrings)**: Muscles supplied by the tibial part of the sciatic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:47">[03:34:47]</a>.

### Hybrid Muscles and Their Innervation
Some muscles receive innervation from multiple nerves.
*   **Pectineus muscle**: Located at the junction of the front and middle compartments of the thigh. It is supplied by both the femoral nerve and the obturator nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:45">[03:44:45]</a>.
*   **Adductor Magnus muscle**: Located at the junction of the back and middle compartments of the thigh. It is supplied by both the tibial part of the sciatic nerve and the obturator nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:54">[03:49:54]</a>.

### Clinical Considerations: Sciatica
In cases of sciatica with tenderness in the hamstring muscles, the [[muscle_and_nerve_innervation_in_limbs | Adductor Magnus muscle]] is a hybrid muscle supplied by the tibial part of the sciatic nerve and the obturator nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>. In such a condition, the obturator nerve supply to the adductor magnus is typically spared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:09">[03:55:09]</a>.

### Muscles Involved in Foot Inversion
Foot inversion is primarily performed by two muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:58">[03:06:58]</a>:
*   **Tibialis Anterior**: Present in the anterior compartment of the leg and supplied by the deep peroneal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>.
*   **Tibialis Posterior**: Present in the posterior compartment of the leg and supplied by the tibial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:31">[03:44:31]</a>. Its tendon is located behind the medial malleolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:58">[03:22:58]</a>.

<div class="callout important">
Examiners frequently ask questions related to the leg, often in both morning and afternoon sessions of examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

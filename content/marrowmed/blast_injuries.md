[[blast_injuries_classification_and_effects | Blast injuries]], also known as bomb blast injuries or Marshall strike, are a frequently targeted topic in examinations like INAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Questions on this topic have appeared multiple times over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Products of an Air Blast
When an air blast or bomb blast occurs, several products are produced that cause injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>:
*   **Blast Wave** The blast wave originates at the center of the explosion and spreads concentrically outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. It is non-directional, meaning it spreads in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Flying Missiles** These are small particles or fragments that break off and fly from the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Terrorists may implant objects like screws, nails, or other sharp objects into the bomb to increase injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. These are directional, affecting the specific body surface exposed to the blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Wind or Victim Displacement** The force of the explosion can displace the victim, causing them to hit a stationary object like a tree, leading to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   **Miscellaneous Factors** Other factors contributing to injury include building collapse or fire following an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

## Types of Blast Injuries
The type of [[blast_injuries_classification_and_effects | blast injury]] sustained depends on which of the above products is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>:
*   **Primary Blast Injury** Injuries directly caused by the blast wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **Secondary Blast Injury** Injuries resulting from flying objects or sharp projectiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. These injuries are known to produce Marshall's triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, which consists of:
    *   Abrasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>
    *   Contusion (bruises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>
    *   Punctured laceration wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>
*   **Tertiary Blast Injury** Injuries sustained due to victim displacement or bodily displacement by wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Quaternary Blast Injury** Injuries arising from any other miscellaneous factors associated with the blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

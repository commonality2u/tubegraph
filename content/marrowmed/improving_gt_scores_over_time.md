Improving scores in Grand Tests (GTs) is a process that requires understanding the test format and adopting an early, consistent approach.

## Understanding the GT "Game"

Initially, it takes approximately 5 to 10 Grand Tests to become familiar with the "game" of solving GTs, especially with the newer [[benefits_of_sectionwise_format_in_gts | section-wise format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This initial phase is crucial for understanding how to approach the questions and manage the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only after grasping this fundamental understanding can significant score improvement begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This highlights the importance of an [[approach_and_mindset_towards_gt_scores_and_exam_strategy | effective approach and mindset]] towards these tests.

## The Importance of Early Engagement

Many believe in waiting until their syllabus is complete before starting GTs, but this is often a flawed strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A syllabus may never truly be "completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and even experienced individuals may not have fully covered all material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Therefore, starting early, even without a complete syllabus, provides a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Starting GTs early helps in several ways:
*   **Develops Guessing Power** It cultivates a good guessing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Encourages Different Thinking** It prompts diverse thinking to arrive at the correct option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Facilitates Inter-subject Connections** It enables the use of knowledge from other subjects to fill gaps in questions where one's primary subject knowledge might be incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

It is strongly advised to [[importance_of_giving_gts_early | give GTs]] as early as possible rather than waiting for syllabus completion, as this completion may never occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

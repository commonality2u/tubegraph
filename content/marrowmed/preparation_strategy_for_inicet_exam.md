Dr. Sayani, a student from Kolkata National Medical College, secured an impressive Rank 5 in her first attempt at the November INICET exam. Her parents were a significant support system throughout her academic journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Journey and Motivation

Dr. Sayani's decision to pursue INICET came after her first INICET attempt (a week after convocation) was not with full preparation, and her subsequent NEET exam result did not secure her desired branch or college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. She viewed the November INICET as her "last chance" to prove herself, make her parents happy, and achieve her dream branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Marrow's Role in Preparation

Dr. Sayani began using Marrow during her second year in 2020, at the start of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. She watched subject-wise videos from her second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Video Lectures and Integration

In her final year, she integrated preclinical subjects like Anatomy, Biochemistry, and Physiology with her final year clinical subjects (Surgery and Medicine) to cover all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This approach prevented boredom and allowed for natural integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Note-Taking Strategy

Initially, Dr. Sayani made her own notes until her third year, for subjects like ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, for final year subjects such as Surgery, Medicine, and OB, she purchased Marrow notes to save time due to the extensive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. She annotated these notes by adding new information or questions obtained from the Marrow question bank, ensuring her notes served as a complete source for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Question Bank Usage

Dr. Sayani solved the Marrow question bank for relevant videos without focusing on her score, aiming to go through all questions at least once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. She also reset the question bank once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. She confirmed that both the Marrow question bank and Marrow Grand Tests (GTs) were helpful in answering tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Mock Exams

She took all available mock exams, including the [[ini_cet_exam_preparation_strategies | INICET mock exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. In the last [[inicet_may_2025_preparation_strategies | INICET mock exam]] before the November exam, she secured a rank of 33, indicating her strong standing among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Mock exams provide an almost true rank and an idea of one's competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Revision Strategy

Dr. Sayani emphasized the importance of the last 10 days and the final revision phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Her [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | revision strategy]] involved:
*   Using First Aid as a base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Adding Marrow-relevant notes, especially volatile points from Marrow faculties, to her personal copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Integrating question bank notes into her revision material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Watching Marrow Delta videos (revision 5.5/6.5) before exams, which she found "super fast and super crisp and very concise to the point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. These revision videos are handy for quickly finishing content or summarizing subjects that were left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Marathons

She participated in Marrow's marathon sessions, particularly the one before NEET PG, which helped push her out of her comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Grand Test Analysis

Dr. Sayani consistently improved her Grand Test (GT) scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Her [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | strategy for analyzing GTs]] was:
1.  **Immediate Review**: Analyze the GT on the same day the results came out, or within one to one and a half days, to ensure the questions and mistakes were fresh in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
2.  **Wrong Questions First**: Start by reviewing all incorrectly answered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
3.  **Unattempted Questions Next**: Proceed to analyze questions that were left unattempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
4.  **Review Correct Questions**: Finally, she would glance through the correct questions, especially those where she might have guessed, to ensure she understood the proper explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## General Advice for Juniors

Dr. Sayani offered the following advice for aspiring students:
*   Do not take excessive pressure about studies; instead, "study smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   Trust the faculty and the chosen study sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   Be consistent in your efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and distractions from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   Make notes crisp and precise for easy and effective revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Dr. Kriti Singh's success in the FMG exam with a score of 248 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> highlights the importance of strategic [[Time management and testtaking techniques | time management]] and consistent study scheduling. Her approach emphasizes early preparation, smart utilization of time, and structured revision.

## Starting Early and Consistency

Dr. Singh began her FMG exam preparation in 2021, during her fourth year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She strongly advises juniors to "start early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a> and to "be consistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This early start allowed her to complete all 19 subjects before even arriving in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. She believes that without consistency, it's difficult to clear any exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## Managing Study During University

Despite a hectic university schedule involving classes, postings, and assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, Dr. Singh found ways to integrate her Marrow studies:
*   **Weekdays:** She managed to watch "two or three videos easily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Weekends:** Saturdays and Sundays were dedicated to making study time "more academically productive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Study Phases and Resource Utilization

Dr. Singh's preparation evolved through distinct phases:

### Initial Phase (Fourth Year Onwards)
*   **Focus on Concepts and Notes:** Her initial focus was on building strong concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> by watching videos and revising notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Handwritten Notes:** Initially, she created all handwritten notes, even for lengthy subjects like OBGY, which amounted to around 1000 pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Delayed Q-Bank Practice:** She did not solve Q-banks at this stage, prioritizing conceptual clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Later Phase (Sixth Year)
*   **Transition to Digital Notes:** She switched to digital notes in her sixth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Extensive Q-Bank Practice:** She started solving Q-banks and completed 597 modules for major subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, finding the Q-bank to be the "gold standard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Revision and Grand Tests (GTS)
*   **Post-Arrival in India:** After landing in India in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, her strategy shifted to watching revision videos and solving Q-banks from August to October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Structured Revisions:** From November, she planned four proper revisions before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Focus on Revision Notes:** During this intense revision period, she focused solely on revision video notes, not the main video notes, to concise everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **No MCQs in Last Two Months:** In the last two months of preparation, she primarily focused on revision and GTS, avoiding daily MCQs or Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Grand Test (GT) Strategy:**
    *   Started giving GTS from August 7th, taking one every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   Gave 20 to 24 GTS before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   Maintained a GT notebook to record wrong topics, which were then reviewed from her main notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This helped in [[Strategies for maximizing performance during exam time | strengthening weak topics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   Her GT scores consistently improved, reflecting her real exam score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Last 10 Days Strategy
*   **Focused Revision:** In the last 10 days, she primarily revised her GT notebook, focusing on topics she frequently answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Recall Videos:** Instead of solving previous year's questions, she watched Marrow's recall videos, finding them useful for understanding concepts beyond just the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This was especially helpful in the last 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Marrow Pearls:** She utilized Marrow Pearls for quick revisions during travel, like on a bus or metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Future Students
Dr. Singh's advice for juniors emphasizes:
*   **Start Early:** Begin preparation well in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Be Consistent:** Maintain a steady study routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on Concepts:** The FMG exam is evolving to be more clinical and concept-based, moving away from rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Clear concepts are the key to solving integrated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Having a clear strategy and sticking to it is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

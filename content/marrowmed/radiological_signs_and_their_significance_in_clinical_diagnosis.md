Radiological signs play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, often providing key insights into underlying conditions and guiding patient management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Interpreting these signs requires not only identifying the primary finding but also understanding its implications and associations, a concept referred to as "second-order thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Button Battery Signs

Ingested button batteries in the esophagus present with specific radiological signs that differentiate them from other foreign bodies like coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>:
*   **Double Ring Sign / Halo Sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>: Seen on frontal radiographs, this sign indicates the presence of two rings corresponding to the battery's two electrodes (a smaller inner anode and a larger outer cathode) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Step-Off Sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>: Seen on lateral views, this sign also results from the differing sizes of the electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

**Clinical Significance**: The anode (smaller ring) is considered more damaging. If the anode faces anteriorly, it poses a risk for tracheoesophageal fistulas; if it faces posteriorly, it may lead to esophago-aortic communications or discitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) and Berry Aneurysms

[[CNS imaging signs related to various conditions | Subarachnoid hemorrhage]] is characterized by a "star-shaped hyperdensity" on non-contrast CT scans, indicating acute blood within the basal cisterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. This is sometimes referred to as the "star of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

**Clinical Significance**: The most common cause of SAH is the rupture of a berry aneurysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Patients often present with a "thunderclap headache" or the "worst headache of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Investigation of Choice**: Non-contrast CT is the initial investigation to establish the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. CT angiography is used to identify the source, such as a berry aneurysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Most Common Site for Berry Aneurysm**: Anterior communicating artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

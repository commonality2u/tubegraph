The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is a predictive tool used by physicians to estimate an individual's 10-year probability of experiencing a fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This tool is specifically developed to predict the risk of [[Proximal femur fractures and treatment strategies | fractures]] in individuals with osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## How FRAX Works
FRAX estimates the combined chance of breaking a hip or other major bones over a 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. A high FRAX score indicates a high probability of experiencing osteoporotic or [[Proximal femur fractures and treatment strategies | fragility fractures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

### Data Input
To generate a predictive score, the FRAX software requires various patient parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>:
*   Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>
*   Sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>
*   Weight and height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>
*   History of [[Proximal femur fractures and treatment strategies | fractures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>
*   Parental history of [[Proximal femur fractures and treatment strategies | fractures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>
*   Smoking status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>
*   Presence of rheumatoid arthritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>
*   Glucocorticoid (steroid) treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>
*   Presence of secondary osteoporosis (e.g., drug-induced, inactivity-related) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>
*   Alcohol consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>
*   Bone mineral density (BMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>

## Clinical Significance
The FRAX score assists in patient management by:
*   **Recommending Treatment:** Identifying patients at high risk of [[Proximal femur fractures and treatment strategies | fractures]] allows for the initiation of treatments, such as anabolics, to prevent further osteoporosis progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Preventing Falls:** It helps in suggesting precautions at home to prevent falls, such as advising appropriate footwear (slippers), ensuring stable walking surfaces, and securing or removing loose rugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Guiding [[fracture_management_strategies | Fracture Management]]**: The tool provides valuable insight into the probability of an individual experiencing a fragility or osteoporotic fracture, guiding proactive management strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Dr. Rajeshwari, from Kakara District, Andhra Pradesh, secured an impressive score of 246 in the FMG January 2025 exam, having completed her undergraduate studies in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Her [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | approach to preparation]] highlights several [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | effective strategies]] for competitive medical exams.

## Early Preparation and Resource Selection

Dr. Rajeshwari began her preparation in her fifth year of undergraduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She chose to take a Marrow subscription with a two-year duration, aiming to have a strong grasp of the material as the exam approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Her rationale for choosing Marrow was its reputation for NEET PG and INI CET preparation, believing that preparing at a higher level would ensure a good score in the FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This strategy aligns with the evolving nature of these exams, where the conducting boards and question quality are becoming increasingly similar and clinically oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Utilizing Video Lectures and Note-Taking

Her daily study routine involved dedicating about three and a half to four hours to Marrow videos, watching approximately four to five modules per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. To maximize efficiency, she typically watched videos at 1.5x speed, increasing to 1.8x for subjects she was more familiar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

A crucial part of her [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | study and revision techniques]] was making her own notes while watching the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For subjects like Anatomy, she incorporated her own diagrams into her notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Revision Strategies

For short subjects, especially due to time constraints in her final year, she opted to use revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Even when using revision videos, she continued to create her own notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If she encountered any concepts that were unclear in the revision videos, she would refer back to the regular, more detailed videos to gain a complete understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The core principle was to understand and master the concept, regardless of the video format used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Practice and Assessment: Question Banks and Grand Tests

### Question Bank Usage
Immediately after watching video modules, Dr. Rajeshwari would engage with the corresponding question bank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This immediate application helped reinforce understanding and facilitate revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. She would add any extra information gleaned from the question bank to her personal notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. She aimed to complete nearly all topics in the question bank, leaving more difficult ones for later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Her success in the question bank was evident, consistently scoring around 80% after watching the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Dr. Rajeshwari started taking Grand Tests in October 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. She noted that her scores in the Grand Tests accurately reflected her performance in the main FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Grand Tests are crucial for providing an actual exam feel, replicating the question quality and trickiness of the real examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

> [!TIP] Overcoming GT Fear
> Many students fear giving Grand Tests due to potential low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Dr. Rajeshwari advises against this fear, emphasizing that initial low scores are normal and will gradually improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. She recommends starting Grand Tests early in the preparation cycle, rather than waiting until the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

After each Grand Test, she utilized the GT analytics feature to identify her weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Upon identifying a weak subject, she would revise it at least twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This analytical approach helps to transparently show weak areas that might otherwise be overlooked, allowing for targeted improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Custom Modules
In the final three to four months of her preparation, Dr. Rajeshwari heavily relied on custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. She created approximately four custom modules per day, each containing 50 questions, totaling around 200 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The benefit of custom modules is their ability to generate random questions from various areas, testing overall knowledge and building confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. She consistently scored 40-42 out of 50 in these modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This consistent practice of 100-200 questions towards the end of preparation is highlighted as very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Key Advice for Juniors

Dr. Rajeshwari's [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | advice for specific medical subjects and exams]] to aspiring students includes:

*   **Consistency:** Be consistent with video lectures and practice question banks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Immediate Application:** Do modules immediately after watching videos to clarify concepts and understand mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Utilize Custom Modules:** Even if all 19 subjects aren't completed, use custom modules with completed subjects to build correlation and integrated understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Start Grand Tests Early:** Overcome the fear of low scores and begin taking Grand Tests from the outset, as scores improve gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Use GT analytics to pinpoint and work on weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

She also praised the Marrow faculty for their ability to explain complex topics simply and easily, allowing for understanding in a single attempt without needing to re-watch videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

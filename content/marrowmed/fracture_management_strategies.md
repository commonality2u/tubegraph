Dr. Baseli, an orthopedics faculty with Maro, discussed key recall questions from the INIET May 2025 orthopedics exam, emphasizing the conceptual understanding of fracture management [00:00:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The questions covered standard topics such as bone infections, upper limb trauma, lower limb trauma, and bone tumors [00:00:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## [[proximal_femur_fractures_and_treatment_strategies|Proximal Femur Fractures]]

Fractures around the hip are a very important topic in examinations [00:01:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These can be broadly classified into two main types based on their location relative to the hip capsule:
*   **Neck of femur fracture** (intracapsular) [00:01:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, [00:02:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Intertrochanteric fracture** (extracapsular) [00:01:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, [00:02:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, [00:02:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

These two types of fractures require different management approaches due to their distinct blood supplies [00:03:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Management of Intertrochanteric Fractures

*   **Pathophysiology**: Intertrochanteric fractures do not typically disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head, but they can lead to malunion, specifically [[terminologies_in_fracture_healing|coxa vara]] [00:03:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, [00:03:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Coxa vara can result in an "Adrenaline bug gate and limp" [00:03:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Treatment Goal**: The primary goal is to maintain the neck-shaft angle [00:01:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, [00:04:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Devices of Choice**:
    *   [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices|Proximal femoral nail]] (intramedullary nail) is considered the best device [00:01:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, [00:04:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, [00:04:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, [00:04:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices|Dynamic hip screw]] (plate with a screw) is another very good option [00:01:58]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, [00:04:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, [00:04:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Age Consideration**: The patient's age is generally not a concern for intertrochanteric fractures, as the treatment is standard across age groups [00:01:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, [00:04:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Non-Operative Management**: In cases of inoperable patients or those with multiple comorbidities preventing surgery, a boot and bar traction or derotation boot (a cast to prevent external rotation) may be used, but this is not standard protocol [00:04:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, [00:05:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, [00:05:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Management of Neck of Femur (Intracapsular) Fractures

*   **Pathophysiology**: These fractures disrupt the blood supply, often leading to avascular necrosis (AVN) and non-union [00:03:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Age Consideration**: The patient's age is a crucial factor in determining management [00:05:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, [00:05:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, [00:05:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   **Patients > 65 years old**:
        *   **Hemiarthroplasty**: The head and neck of the femur are replaced [00:05:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, [00:05:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Common prostheses include bipolar, Austin Moore, or Thomson prostheses, with bipolar being considered the best [00:05:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, [00:05:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
        *   **Total Hip Arthroplasty (Total Hip Replacement)**: If the patient has pre-existing hip conditions like osteoarthritis or degeneration, the head, neck, and acetabular cup are replaced [00:06:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, [00:06:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, [00:06:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Patients < 65 years old**:
        *   **Duration of Fracture**: The duration of the fracture is important [00:06:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
        *   **Fresh fracture (< 3 weeks old)**: [[types_of_fracture_healing_and_fixation_methods|Close reduction and internal fixation]] with cannulated cancellous screws are performed [00:06:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, [00:06:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, [00:06:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Typically, three screws are placed in an inverted triangle fashion [00:06:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Scaphoid Fracture Management

Scaphoid fractures are commonly caused by a fall on an outstretched hand in young individuals, presenting with pain, tenderness, or fullness in the anatomical snuff box [00:07:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, [00:07:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis**: Scaphoid fracture is primarily a clinical diagnosis [00:08:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Initial X-rays may be negative in 25-30% of patients [00:08:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, [00:08:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Initial Management**: Even with negative X-rays but positive clinical findings, assume a scaphoid fracture and immobilize the wrist [00:08:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, [00:08:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   Apply a **thumb spica cast/splint** [00:08:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, [00:10:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   Review the patient and repeat X-rays after 10-14 days (1-2 weeks) [00:08:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, [00:08:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, [00:10:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Follow-up Imaging**:
    *   If the fracture line becomes visible on repeat X-rays (due to osteolysis at the fracture site), continue the cast for 6-8 weeks until healing [00:08:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, [00:08:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, [00:08:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, [00:10:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   If X-rays remain normal and the patient has no pain, no further treatment is needed [00:09:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, [00:10:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   If X-rays remain normal but the patient still has pain, consider further imaging like an MRI scan to rule out a fracture [00:09:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, [00:09:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, [00:09:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, [00:10:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, [00:10:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. MRI is not routinely done unless immediate diagnosis is essential or pain persists despite normal X-rays, as it's an unnecessary expense if management isn't changing [00:10:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, [00:10:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, [00:10:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Other Related Orthopedic Conditions

### [[identifying_and_managing_bone_tumors|Bone Tumors]]

*   **Osteosarcoma**: Often indicated by imaging findings such as "sunburst appearance" and "Codman's triangle" on X-ray, especially in a 17-year-old [00:11:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, [00:11:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, [00:11:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Codman's triangle appears when aggressive tumor growth elevates the periosteum, with bone formation or calcification at the edges [00:12:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Sunray/sunburst appearance refers to calcified Sharpie's fibers [00:12:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ewing Sarcoma**: While sunray/sunburst appearance can also occur in Ewing sarcoma, and "onion peel" appearance is typical for Ewing sarcoma, these periosteal reactions are non-specific and not pathognomonic [00:11:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, [00:12:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, [00:12:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Diagnosis relies more on age, bone involvement, location, and especially biopsy findings like CD99 positivity, MIC2 gene mutation, small round blue cells with pseudo-rosettes, or translocation 11;22 [00:12:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, [00:12:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, [00:12:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, [00:13:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, [00:13:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### [[diagnosing_and_managing_bone_infections|Bone Infections]]

*   **Chronic Osteomyelitis**: Characterized by pain, swelling, warmth, elevated ESR and CRP, and an X-ray showing sclerotic bone fragment (sequester) surrounded by lucencies in the medulla (involucrum) [00:13:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, [00:14:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, [00:14:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, [00:14:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, [00:14:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, [00:14:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Causative Organisms**:
    *   **Most Common**: *Staphylococcus aureus* [00:14:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, [00:15:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
    *   **Other Common Causes**: *E. coli*, *Streptococcus*, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (especially in India) [00:14:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, [00:14:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, [00:15:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
    *   ***Klebsiella*** is generally considered an unlikely cause [00:14:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, [00:15:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Exceptions**:
        *   **Sickle cell disease**: *Salmonella* [00:15:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
        *   **IV drug abusers**: *Pseudomonas* [00:15:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
        *   **Animal bites**: *Pastella* [00:15:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
        *   **Human bites**: *Eikenella* [00:15:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
        *   **Prolonged parental therapy**: Fungal organisms [00:15:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Diagnosis of Spinal Tuberculosis

*   **WHO Recommended Investigation**: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) or Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAT) for rapid detection of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and rifampicin resistance [00:15:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, [00:15:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, [00:15:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, [00:17:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, [00:17:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, [00:17:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, [00:17:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This test is automated and provides results in less than 2 hours [00:17:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, [00:18:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, [00:18:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Gold Standard**: Culture of tissue collected from the infection site (after MRI to locate and CT-guided biopsy) is the gold standard for diagnosis [00:16:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, [00:16:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, [00:16:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, [00:16:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, [00:17:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. However, it is time-consuming (2-6 weeks for growth), invasive, and expensive, making it less suitable for primary diagnostic testing [00:16:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, [00:16:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, [00:16:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, [00:17:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, [00:18:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

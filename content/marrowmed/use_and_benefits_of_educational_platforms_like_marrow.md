The educational platform [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]] was a primary source of preparation for Dr. Pushwand, who achieved Rank 9 in the INICET examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Key Features and Utilization

### Video Lectures and Faculty Influence
[[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow video lectures]] are highly regarded, with several faculties being particularly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Dr. Pushwand highlighted the following:
*   Rakesh Nayer's videos ignited interest in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   The pharmacology section provided a different perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   Manisha Ma'am's ENT teaching was highly appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   Sakshi Ma'am's OBG teaching was also liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   Dohan's videos helped make surgery tolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Approach to Video Content
Dr. Pushwand did not follow a marathon approach to watching videos from start to finish. Instead, he would watch videos selectively, focusing on topics where he needed information or better understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This method allowed him to connect practical clinical knowledge gained from patient cases or class discussions with relevant [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Notes and Study Materials
While printed notes were ordered, a newer version became available before they could be fully utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Dr. Pushwand primarily used his own handwritten notes and later incorporated annotated notes provided by a friend, which he further enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. These consolidated notes served as a concise and crisp resource for revision, integrating important MCQs and new points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### MCQ Practice and Features
MCQ practice is considered equally important to mastering concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Dr. Pushwand's strategy included:
*   Targeting at least 50 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   Initially practicing MCQs from topics studied 4 days to a week prior to facilitate active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   Transitioning to random customized modules across all 19 subjects after completing one proper reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   [[Utilization of educational resources like Marrow videos and Q Bank | Marrow's custom modules]] were highly beneficial, acting as "mini GTs" (Grand Tests) to provide a good idea of performance and serve as daily mock exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   The bookmark feature was extensively used for MCQs, with the important realization that bookmarks need regular screening and updating, removing questions that have been mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   The "Magic Module" feature was also highly regarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
The frequency of Grand Tests increased over time:
*   Initially, one GT every two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   Later, one GT per week in the last few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   No GTs were taken in the last 10 days before the exam, focusing instead on preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Reviewing Grand Tests
Efficient review of GTs is crucial:
*   [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] provides a filter option to review wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   It's important to mark questions that were guessed correctly, as they indicate concepts not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   Reviewing only the marked questions (guessed correct and wrong) is more efficient than reviewing the entire GT, saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Time Management During Exams
Practicing time management during GTs is vital for exam day:
*   Aim to complete each section with at least seven minutes to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   Treat GTs as realistic exam simulations, being strict about sitting through the entire duration without distractions like phones or browsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   Avoid spending more than one minute on questions you don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.
*   For lengthy questions, read the last line and options first to quickly identify if you know the answer; if so, then read the entire question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   Due to changes in exam rules, avoid using "mark for review" if it means the answer won't be counted. Instead, note down the answer on paper and review it if time permits, ensuring an answer is submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
*   Aim for one solid revision of important notes in the last 1 to 1.5 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   Focus revision on important topics, especially those identified as weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   Avoid giving GTs in the last 10 days before the exam to prevent potential drops in confidence from low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   Prioritize reviewing content, especially important topics, as exams often repeat concepts with different perspectives or in greater depth, rather than introducing entirely new, diverse topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This aligns with the "80% of questions from 20% of topics" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

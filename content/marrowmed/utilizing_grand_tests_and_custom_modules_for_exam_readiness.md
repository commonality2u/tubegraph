Dr. D, a successful candidate who achieved Rank 8 in the INCT November 2024 exam, shared insights into his preparation strategy, emphasizing the role of Marrow's grand tests and custom modules.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. D considered grand tests a crucial component of his exam preparation, starting them early in his final year [00:06:25]. He would take subject tests as they became available and focused primarily on grand tests [00:06:30]. He generally avoided mini-tests, finding they caused anxiety due to consistently poor ranks [00:06:38].

### Review and Analysis
A key aspect of his strategy was the thorough review of grand tests [00:06:56]. He dedicated a full day to review each GT, focusing religiously on the incorrect answers [00:07:02]. This disciplined review process was essential for maximizing the benefits of the tests [00:07:14].

### Benchmarking and Identifying Weaker Areas
While grand tests provide knowledge, Dr. D also used them to benchmark his performance against other students, which boosted his confidence when he consistently achieved good ranks [00:07:40]. More importantly, GTs served as a tool to identify his weaker subjects, allowing him to prioritize those areas during his revision [00:08:00]. This approach helped him tailor his study plan to address specific deficiencies [00:08:17]. He advised that by starting GTs early in the final year, students can identify their weak subjects, which can then be prioritized during their internship for revision [00:08:33].

## Custom Modules

Dr. D acknowledged that he was not an "avid user" of the [[utilizing_custom_modules_for_exam_preparation | custom module]] feature [00:11:11]. However, he did utilize them in a collaborative setting with a friend during his internship [00:11:18].

### Usage and Purpose
The [[utilizing_custom_modules_for_exam_preparation | custom modules]] were used as a means of "practice" and to "get some questions done in the day" [00:12:16]. Instead of just reading notes, they would create and solve 50 or 100-question modules together, sometimes even setting them to "full hard" mode [00:11:27]. These were primarily "mixed bag" modules, not specifically tailored to weaker subjects, but rather for general practice [00:12:19]. He noted that while it's ideal to use previous year tags for custom modules, he mostly used mixed tags and did not rely too heavily on previous year questions (PYQs) as he did not believe most questions were repeated [00:11:43].

## Overall Exam Readiness

The combined approach of extensive [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | question bank]] practice and strategic utilization of grand tests, along with some use of [[utilizing_custom_modules_for_exam_preparation | custom modules]], contributed significantly to Dr. D's success. He emphasized consistency throughout the preparation journey and having a clear goal for one's desired branch early on [00:16:09].

The nerve supply of the ear is a frequently examined topic, often presented either directly or in the context of referred otalgia (ear pain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This area of [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | functional anatomy relating to cranial nerves and sensory pathways]] is crucial for understanding various clinical presentations.

## Nerve Supply of the Pinna (External Ear)

The skin covering the pinna receives nerve supply from adjacent areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

*   **Auriculotemporal Nerve:** Supplies the skin over the tragus, the ascending crus of the helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>, the anterior wall and roof of the external auditory canal, and the anterior and superior parts of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.
*   **Greater Auricular Nerve:** A branch of C2 and C3, it supplies the major part of both the lateral and medial surfaces of the pinna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>.
*   **Lesser Occipital Nerve (C2):** Supplies the posterosuperior part of the pinna on the medial surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.
*   **Vagus Nerve:** Supplies the concha of the pinna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, the floor and posterior wall of the external auditory canal, and the lower and posterior part of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.
*   **Facial Nerve:** Provides a small contribution to the posterosuperior part of the external auditory meatus and the anterior part of the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

## Referred Otalgia

Referred otalgia is pain perceived in the ear that originates from a different anatomical location, typically due to shared nerve pathways. Understanding these connections is key to diagnosing and treating pain that may seem to originate in the ear but does not. This is a common topic in [[Clinical implications of cranial nerve injuries | clinical implications of cranial nerve injuries]].

*   **Cervical Spondylitis:** Pain from cervical spondylitis involving C2 and C3 can be referred to the ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.
*   **Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X):** As the main nerve supply of the larynx and hypopharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>, it can refer pain to the ear.
    *   Carcinoma of the larynx or piriform fossa can cause ear pain via the Vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>.
    *   A patient coughing while cleaning the ear is also due to stimulation of the Vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a>.
*   **Glossopharyngeal Nerve (Cranial Nerve IX):** Conditions of the oropharynx can cause referred pain to the ear.
    *   Acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsil carcinoma, and base of tongue carcinoma can all cause ear pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.
    *   This referred pain occurs through the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, also known as Jacobson's nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. Jacobson's nerve supplies the middle ear and the medial surface of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.

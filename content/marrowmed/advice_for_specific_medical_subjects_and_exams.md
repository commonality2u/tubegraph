This article provides guidance for medical students preparing for upcoming competitive exams like NEET PG, INICET, and FMG, incorporating new features in Marrow Edition 8 and offering expert advice from faculty members. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

## Upcoming Exam Dates & Preparation Outlook

While the National Board of Examination has released tentative schedules for various exams, the date for NEET PG 2025 remains unannounced. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> Given the unpredictable nature of the National Board, it is advisable to prepare with early April 2025 in mind. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> Any time gained beyond this will be a bonus for additional revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> Realistically, some experts suggest a June end or July 1st possibility for NEET PG 2025 due to ongoing counseling for the previous batch and the scheduling of SS exams in late March. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>

For students who have already secured a rank but are waiting for preferred subjects or colleges, it is crucial to stay in touch with studies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> This includes solving questions and revising notes, as maintaining touch with the subjects significantly improves chances of improving rank in future attempts, especially for exams like INICET. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

## INI CET Exam Strategy

Do not be afraid to appear for the INI CET exam. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> It is a more predictable exam with timely counseling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> Many students surprisingly do not consider it, but everyone should at least attempt it for practice, which can also improve preparation for NEET PG. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>

INI CET is considered mandatory as it serves as a preparatory exam for NEET PG, offering a realistic chance for selection due to its consistent areas of questioning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>

### Topic Overlap

Historically, topics in INI CET were slightly different from NEET PG, but there is now a significant overlap across INI CET, NEET PG, and FMG exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> This means that questions and topics are often repeated across these exams, blurring boundaries between them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> Therefore, it is crucial to solve previous year questions (PYQs) from INI CET and FMG exams as part of your NEET PG preparation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

### Subject Focus for INI CET

INI CET tends to focus more on First and Second Year subjects, which often act as rank deciders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> Focus more on these subjects during your revision for INI CET. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>

## NEET PG 2024 Analysis and Future Preparation

NEET PG 2024 was described as a "true bouncer," akin to the difficult 2020 exam, emphasizing integration and questions combining multiple subjects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> The biggest surprise was the introduction of five blocks of questions (40 questions per block, 42 minutes to answer), requiring quick identification of the core of a question amidst unnecessary details. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>

This new format demands strong temperament, not just knowledge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> Questions are less straightforward, testing the understanding of a topic and the ability to apply that idea quickly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>

### Key Changes in Exam Pattern:

*   **Integration:** The boundaries between subjects are diminishing, with questions integrating concepts from various fields. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   **Basic Concepts:** There is a greater focus on basic concepts rather than advanced ones. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>
*   **Mixed Question Types:** Exams include a blend of 50% single-liner questions and 50% concept-based questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>
*   **Image-Based Questions:** A significant number of image-based questions are being asked across NEET PG, FMG, and INI CET. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

Candidates need to focus on keywords and images in clinical branches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> Knowing either can help answer the question, even without knowing both. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> Success relies on quick application and clear basic concepts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> This approach often favors freshers due to its emphasis on foundational understanding and quick thinking rather than just depth of knowledge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>

## Marrow Edition 8: Features and Subject-Specific Advice

Edition 8 has replaced Edition 6.5, offering updated and crisp content focused on INICET, NEET PG, and FMG exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> It is less time-consuming and more palatable, with core medicine content reduced to 125 hours. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>

### Revision Videos

Edition 8 features 200+ hours of updated revision videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> Faculty members have condensed information into stipulated times, incorporating more tables and mind maps for quick revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a> Soft copy notes are live, and PDFs will be sent by the second week of December to registered email IDs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>

### Subject-Specific Advice:

#### ObGyn (Dr. Sakshi)
*   **Mind Maps:** Used to condense material (e.g., 8-10 pages into 1-2 pages) for quick revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a> Over 50 mind maps are included in ObGyn revision videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>
*   **No Skipping Topics:** All topics should be revised thoroughly due to recent questions on basic concepts like implantation, fertilization, oogenesis, and spermatogenesis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>
*   **Supplementation:** While revision videos are generally sufficient, new students should watch main videos for "Labor" (Obstetrics) and "Normal Sexual Development and Disorders of Sexual Development" (Gynaecology) to build concepts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>
*   **PYQs:** All important previous year questions (PYQs) are included within the revision videos themselves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>

#### Surgery (Dr. Rohan)
*   **Revision Videos Sufficiency:** Revision videos can help achieve 80% correct answers in surgery if watched 2-3 times and thoroughly understood. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>
*   **Top Ranks:** For top ranks (e.g., Top 500), revision videos must be supplemented with important main videos or extensive knowledge from the QBank. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>
*   **Switching Editions:** If you have completed Edition 6.5 surgery videos, there is no need to switch to Edition 8; instead, focus on Baily update videos and PYQ sessions from recent exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>
*   **PYQs:** Important PYQ topics and questions are mentioned at the beginning of each topic in the revision videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>

#### Medicine (Dr. Rakesh)
*   **Revision Video Design:** These videos are structured, simple, and straightforward, aiming to build a solid understanding of important areas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a> They serve as a "huge confidence booster." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>
*   **Integration Videos:** An additional 8 hours of integration videos test application through scenarios, picture connections, and complex questions, mirroring the NEET PG 2024 exam pattern. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>
*   **Application is Key:** The ability to apply learned concepts in the exam hall is paramount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a> Focus on identifying the core idea and shooting the answer quickly, utilizing the "Art of Elimination" (ruling out wrong options). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>
*   **Edition 8 Main Videos:** The Edition 8 main videos for medicine are more concise (125 hours of core content) and easier to complete. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>

#### Anatomy (Dr. Ashwini)
*   **Content Consistency:** Anatomy content remains constant; however, examiners change the "face of the question" dramatically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>
*   **Topic Prioritization:** Focus on Embryology, Head, Neck, Face, and Neuroanatomy as top priorities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>
*   **Limit Viscera:** While not to be skipped entirely, viscera can be limited as clinical questions from other subjects often cover related anatomy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>
*   **Limbs:** Integrate limb anatomy with Orthopedics, focusing on nerves and nerve injuries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>
*   **Existing Users:** If you have watched Dr. Raj's previous videos, you can stick to your original notes and use the new revision videos to identify discussion topics and read from your notes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>

#### Microbiology (Dr. Nasir)
*   **Simplification:** The aim is to simplify microbiology, making "macrobio" (large amount of infectious diseases from various clinical subjects) into "microbio" (simplified core). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>
*   **Sufficient for Most Questions:** Revision videos are designed to help answer most questions, though main videos are necessary for all questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>
*   **Concepts over Facts:** Emphasizes understanding concepts rather than rote memorization, even in a seemingly factual subject. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>
*   **Signature Points:** Uses "Dr. N's Blueprints," "Dr. N's Key Points," and "Dr. N's Magical Boxes" as mnemonic replacements to aid understanding, remembering, and answering. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>
*   **Flexibility:** Revision videos are designed to be useful whether you've studied organism-wise or system-wise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>

### Marrow Revision Videos for FMG Exam

For the FMG exam, revision videos are definitely enough. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a> It is recommended to use them alongside a list of PYTs (Previous Year Topics) to ensure all covered topics are ticked off. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> However, if your exam is very soon (e.g., January 12th), it might be better to stick with old revision videos if you're comfortable with them and supplement with PYQs and QBank, rather than switching to Edition 8 at the last minute. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>

## General Study and Revision Techniques

### Revision Videos vs. Main Videos

*   **Guideline:** After watching revision video lectures for a topic, if you score more than 70-75% correct in the QBank, stick to revision videos and continue solving QBank questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>
*   **Supplementation:** If your QBank performance dips below 60-65%, use the main video lectures to address gaps in understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>
*   **Thoroughness:** If relying solely on revision videos and QBank, ensure every line of the revision video is thoroughly understood and learned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>

### Study Timeline

Aim to finish all subjects by the end of January (+/- 15 days) by watching revision videos (approx. 200 hours). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a> This allows for four hours of videos daily and two hours of QBank practice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>

Then, target two solid revisions:
1.  **First Revision:** 45 days, until mid-March. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>
2.  **Second Revision:** From mid-March to mid-April. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>

This schedule allows for multiple revisions if the exam is later than April. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>

### QBank Usage

The QBank is a vital learning tool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>
*   **Prioritization:** Prioritize solving PYQs first, then move to other questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>
*   **Custom Modules:** Create custom modules based on frequently asked PYTs (e.g., drug of choice, investigation of choice, image-based, instruments, clinical problems, recent questions). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>
*   **Difficulty:** The QBank offers a good mix of questions. If some are too difficult, create custom modules focusing on easy and moderate difficulties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>
*   **Consistency:** Solving questions regularly is key; it takes 36-38 days for a habit to form. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>

### 20th Notebook

This notebook should be customized to your specific weak areas and factual errors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a> Do not rely on generic 20th notebooks from others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   **Content:** Include factual errors encountered during QBank practice or Grand Tests (e.g., tables of tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein increase). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>
*   **Digital Format:** Create a private WhatsApp group to quickly note down things you cannot remember. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a> Review it during idle times (traveling, waiting in wards) and delete information you've now memorized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>

### Funnel Approach to Revision
The goal is to cut down revision time by half with each subsequent revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>
1.  **First Reading/First Revision:** Focus on getting more information into your mind. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>
2.  **Underlining Notes:** Maintain a uniform pattern of underlining (e.g., orange for keywords, yellow for concepts, green for investigation of choice) to create a visual impression for quick recall during exams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>
3.  **Second Revision:** Focus on underlined notes and the content of your 20th notebook/group. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>
4.  **Final Revision (Last 2 Weeks):** Focus solely on your 20th notebook/group and custom modules of bookmarked or previous year questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>

### Bookmarked MCQs and Magic Modules
*   **Bookmarked MCQs:** To manage a large number of bookmarked MCQs, create custom modules based on subjects or weak topics for targeted revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>
*   **Magic Modules:** This new Marrow feature generates high-yield MCQs based on your previous mistakes, serving as an excellent tool for revision and building confidence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a> They unlock as you solve more questions and make mistakes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Regularity:** Take Grand Tests regularly (weekly or fortnightly). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a> Do not wait to finish all subjects to start. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>
*   **Review:** Review GTs on the same day by focusing on incorrect answers and questions you guessed correctly (using the guess tracker). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>
*   **Categorize Mistakes:**
    *   **Silly Mistakes:** Due to misreading; will reduce with practice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>
    *   **Concept-Based Mistakes:** Indicates a gap in understanding; go back to main videos to revise the concept. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>
    *   **Factual Mistakes:** Indicates a forgotten fact; add this information (e.g., tables) to your 20th notebook for later revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>
*   **Time Management:** Practice solving questions quickly to improve speed and finish the exam on time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>

### Pearls
Pearls are extremely important for quick revision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a> They provide concise tables and include mapped PYQs, making them a good replacement for your 20th notebook. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a> Pearls are accessible to all, even non-subscribers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a> Utilize them during idle time, like while traveling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>

## Overcoming Procrastination

*   **Start Small:** Begin with small, achievable targets (e.g., making your bed, brushing teeth, studying for two hours) to build momentum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>
*   **Start with Loved Subjects:** If you're a procrastinator, begin with subjects you enjoy to set a positive rhythm before tackling challenging ones. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>
*   **Focus on Your Circle of Control:** Dedicate time to what you can control (study hours, planning, question solving) rather than worrying about factors outside your control (exam date, difficulty). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>
*   **Positive Influence:** Surround yourself with positive people who support your goals and do not increase anxiety. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>

## Advice for Specific Student Groups

### Working Professionals
The suggested timeline (200 hours of revision videos, 4 hours daily for 50 days, plus 2 hours of QBank) is achievable even while working. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>

### Interns
*   **Leverage Recent Knowledge:** As you've recently covered final year subjects, start with QBank practice for those. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>
*   **Re-engage with Early Subjects:** For first and second-year subjects, which you may have lost touch with, take them up one by one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>
*   **Mix Subjects:** Balance one weak subject with one strong subject to maintain interest and tackle all of them effectively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>
*   **Integrate Study with Internship:** Prepare custom PYT modules in the morning to review during internship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a> After internship, revise those topics using main or revision videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>

> [!important] Goal-Oriented Study
> Be aware that just doing previous year topics might not be enough to secure a top rank (e.g., breaking the 3,000-4,000 barrier). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a> Top scorers often build strong foundations during their undergraduate years, and their preparation is primarily focused on [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a> Your [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques for medical exams]] and strategy should align with your rank aspirations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>

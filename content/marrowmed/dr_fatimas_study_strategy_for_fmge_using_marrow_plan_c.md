Dr. Fatima achieved an impressive score of 246 out of 300 in the recently concluded FMGE exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Having pursued her MBBS from Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, she extensively utilized Marrow Plan C throughout her medical education and dedicated exam preparation.

## Journey with Marrow Plan C

Dr. Fatima began using Marrow from her second year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Initially, she used it inconsistently, primarily for supplementary lectures that provided added information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. She found it particularly helpful for challenging subjects like pharmacology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. During this phase, she created small notes while listening to lectures, using Marrow Edition 4/4.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

She mainly used Marrow's complete main videos for her four core clinical subjects: medicine, OBGYN, surgery, and pediatrics, as well as some ENT and ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This usage helped her with her clinical postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. By the time she was in her clinical years, she was on Marrow Edition 6.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### MBBS Academics in Dubai

The MBBS program in Dubai consisted of two and a half years of preclinical subjects (anatomy, biochemistry, physiology) similar to India, followed by clinical years (third and fourth years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Students spent whole days at the hospital for clinical postings, learning from rounds, supplemented by evening lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Approach to MCQs During MBBS

Even during her MBBS, Dr. Fatima solved MCQs related to the main video topics, especially for the four major subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. She focused on topics she found difficult, believing that solving Q-banks helped in better understanding and identifying areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She did not specifically filter questions by hashtags like NEET PG or FMGE during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

**Key Insight:** Preparing with NEET PG modules significantly benefits FMGE preparation, as pushing oneself beyond the immediate target level leads to better scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## [[preparation_strategies_for_fmge | Dedicated FMGE Preparation Strategies]]

Dr. Fatima commenced her intensive [[effective_fmge_preparation_strategies | preparation for the FMGE exam]] in September, after her internship concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, dedicating six months to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   **Preclinical Subjects**: Recognizing her weakness in preclinical subjects, she focused on listening to their revision modules and solving corresponding Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Clinical Subjects**: For clinical subjects, where she had already completed the main videos and had notes, she avoided re-watching videos. Instead, she primarily read her notes and solved Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This strategy prevented her from feeling overwhelmed by having to watch revision videos as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Daily MCQ Practice

For those with a six-month preparation window, she advises starting with 50-100 MCQs daily and gradually increasing the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. She emphasizes that revision is more effective through questions, as it promotes active recall, rather than passive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The ultimate goal is to become familiar with the exam format, particularly ruling out options in an MCQ-based exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Managing Incorrect Questions

To address wrong answers, Dr. Fatima bookmarked them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If an incorrect question involved an image or flowchart, she saved it and integrated it into her notes to ensure she reviewed that specific topic during subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Mock Tests

Dr. Fatima participated in the FMGE mock test, scoring around 223 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Her scores in Grand Tests (GTs) varied, ranging from 160 to 200, starting from around 170 initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. She started giving GTs approximately two to three weeks after starting her dedicated preparation in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Utilizing GT Analysis for Improvement

A critical aspect of her [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | strategy]] was using the GT analysis provided by Marrow. This analysis highlighted her weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Before taking the next GT, she would prioritize studying these weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. She recognized that scores could fluctuate based on revision, so she consistently revised weaker areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Comparison of Marrow GTs and Actual FMGE

Dr. Fatima noted that the actual FMGE paper felt tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, particularly the first paper being more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, the structure of the exam (preclinical/PSM in paper one, clinical subjects in paper two) was consistent with how Marrow's GTs were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Her extensive practice with GTs and Q-banks helped her feel less pressured during the actual exam, as she was accustomed to analyzing and ruling out options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | Comprehensive Study Approach]]

Dr. Fatima emphasizes that students should not solely focus on previous year's questions (PYQs) for the [[advice_for_future_fmge_exam_takers | FMGE exam]]. Given the reduction in direct repeats in recent FMGE exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, it is crucial to:

*   **Read around topics**: Understand the broader context of a subject rather than just memorizing PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Build a strong base**: Establish a fundamental understanding of each subject, which will also serve as a foundation for future exams like NEET PG or INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Expand Q-bank practice**: Start with FMGE PYQs, then incorporate NEET PG and AIIMS hashtags, as the same board conducts these exams and might include PYQs from other national-level medical entrance tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Last Month Strategy

In the final month before the exam, Dr. Fatima aimed to complete a second revision of all 19 subjects within 20 days, though she managed to cover half of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. In the last 10 days, she avoided excessive pressure. Instead, she focused on:
*   Solving Q-banks for subjects she hadn't fully completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Solving PYQs from NEET PG and AIIMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Reading explanations from the Q-banks and then revisiting her notes for those specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Subject Strengths and Weaknesses

*   **Strongest Subject**: Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Weakest Subject**: Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
    *   For pharmacology, she focused on solving Q-banks, annotating more information, and strategically balancing her score by performing well in other subjects rather than pushing too hard on pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Favorite Marrow Feature

Her favorite feature of the [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow app]] was the custom modules, as they allowed her to consolidate practice within the app without needing external resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

[[endemic_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | Endemic fungal atypical pneumonia]] is primarily caused by five specific [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]]: *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, *Paracoccidioides*, and *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## General Clinical Manifestations

Atypical pneumonia caused by these [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | dimorphic fungi]] manifests with common [[symptoms_of_respiratory_infectiions | symptoms of respiratory infections]], including cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath), typically without consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Chest pain may also be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Treatment
The [[treatment_for_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | treatment for all five]] of these fungal pneumonias is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>:
*   **Mild to moderate cases:** Itraconazole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Severe cases:** Liposomal Amphotericin B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Diagnostic Methods
While clinical presentation and treatment are consistent across these five fungi, their [[diagnostic_methods_for_dimorphic_fungi | lab diagnosis]] differs significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. As they are [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]], diagnosis involves identifying both their yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Specific Fungi and Their Identification

### Histoplasma
*   **Disease Names:** Histoplasmosis, Darling's disease, Ohio Valley Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It is called Ohio Valley Fever because it is commonly seen along the Ohio Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form:** Characterized by intracellular yeast cells, meaning the yeast is found within cells, such as macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. *Histoplasma* is the only intracellular fungus among these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Mold Form:** Identified by tuberculate conidia, which are conidia surrounded by tubercules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Blastomyces
*   **Disease Names:** Blastomycosis, Gilchrist's disease, North American Blastomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It is most commonly seen in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form:** Shows broad-based budding yeast cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This appearance is sometimes described as a "figure of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Mold Form:** Characterized by pear-shaped conidia found along the hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Coccidioides
*   **Disease Names:** Coccidioidomycosis, Valley Fever, California Valley Fever, Desert Rheumatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It is found along the valley of California and most commonly in desert areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form:** Identified by spherules, which are yeast cells containing endospores inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Mold Form:** Features arthroconidia with fragmented hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Arthroconidia are rectangularly shaped conidia present in between the hyphae, making them appear fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Paracoccidioides
*   **Disease Names:** Paracoccidioidomycosis, South American Blastomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It is most commonly found in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. It is called South American Blastomycosis because its mold form, like *Blastomyces*, also has pear-shaped conidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form:** Displays yeast cells with projections resembling "Mickey Mouse ears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Mold Form:** Also characterized by pear-shaped conidia, similar to *Blastomyces* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Talaromyces marneffei
*   **Unique Characteristic:** Produces red pigment on SDA (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Disease Names:** Talaromycosis, Penicilliosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Penicilliosis is used because *Talaromyces marneffei* was formerly known as *Penicillium marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form:** Identified by oval-shaped yeast cells with a septum (internal division) in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Mold Form:** Exhibits a "bottle brush appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This is due to conidiophores ending with phialides that produce chains of conidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

The five [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]] that cause [[endemic_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | endemic fungal atypical pneumonia]] share common clinical manifestations such as pneumonia with dyspnea and cough, and respond to the same [[treatment_for_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | treatment]] (Itraconazole or Liposomal Amphotericin B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, their [[diagnostic_methods_for_dimorphic_fungi | lab diagnosis]] relies on distinguishing their unique yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

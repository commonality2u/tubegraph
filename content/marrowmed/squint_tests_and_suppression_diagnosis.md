## Worth 4-Dot Test

The Worth 4-Dot test is a diagnostic tool used in ophthalmology to identify and differentiate between various conditions related to binocular vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. It helps determine if a patient has [[binocular_single_vision | binocular single vision]], [[anomalous_retinal_correspondence | anomalous retinal correspondence]], or [[squint_tests_and_suppression_diagnosis | suppression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Test Setup and Components
During the Worth 4-Dot test, a patient typically wears a red glass over their right eye and a green glass over their left eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The test display consists of four dots: one red, two green, and one white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Interpreting Results

The interpretation of the Worth 4-Dot test depends on which colors and how many dots the patient reports seeing:

*   **Right Eye Suppression**
    *   If the patient can only see the green dots, it indicates that the left eye is functional, but the right eye is not contributing to vision, leading to [[squint_tests_and_suppression_diagnosis | suppression]] of the right eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This is because the green glass is worn over the left eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

*   **Left Eye Suppression**
    *   If only the red dot(s) are visible, it means the right eye is working, but there is [[squint_tests_and_suppression_diagnosis | suppression]] of the left eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

*   **Binocular Single Vision (Normal)**
    *   If the patient can see all four dots (one red, two green, and one white), it indicates [[binocular_single_vision | binocular single vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This means both eyes are working together without any problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **Diplopia or Anomalous Retinal Correspondence**
    *   If more than four dots are visible (e.g., three green from the left eye and two red from the right eye), it suggests that the patient is experiencing [[diplopia | diplopia]] (double vision) or has non-harmonious [[anomalous_retinal_correspondence | abnormal retinal correspondence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. In such cases, the eyes are seeing what they need to see individually, but fusion of the images is not occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

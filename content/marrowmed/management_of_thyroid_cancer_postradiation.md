Thyroid cancers that develop following radiation exposure, such as in patients with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma who received chest wall irradiation, are considered more aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Surgical Management

For differentiated thyroid cancers, hemithyroidectomy is an acceptable option under specific criteria (unilateral, 1-4 cm, no extrathyroidal spread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, radiation-induced differentiated thyroid cancers are an exception to this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, due to their more aggressive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

In cases of radiation-induced thyroid cancer, a total thyroidectomy is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Lymph Node Management

The decision for lymph node clearance depends on the presence and extent of lymph node involvement:
*   If no lymph nodes are enlarged, modified radical neck dissection (MRN) is not indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, and the patient would only undergo a total thyroidectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   If Level VI lymph nodes are involved, total thyroidectomy plus Central Neck Dissection (CND) is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. CND specifically refers to Level VI dissection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   For T3 or T4 disease, a prophylactic Central Neck Dissection is undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   If other lymph nodes are enlarged, the patient will undergo total thyroidectomy plus Central Neck Dissection plus Modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

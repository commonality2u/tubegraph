Enzyme deficiencies lead to various [[metabolic_disorders_and_enzymes | metabolic disorders]] due to impaired biochemical pathways, often resulting in characteristic clinical presentations. The NEET PG 2024 examination featured several scenario-based questions focusing on these conditions, emphasizing high-yielding topics such as [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | metabolic disorders]] and vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Homocystinuria
[[homocystinuria_and_related_metabolic_pathways | Homocystinuria]] is a [[metabolic_disorders_and_enzymes | metabolic disorder]] affecting methionine and cysteine metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Classic Homocystinuria
*   **Enzyme Defect:** Cystathionine beta synthase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Biochemical Impact:** Reduced cysteine levels and normal methionine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features:** Ectopia lentis (dislocated lens) and hypoplasia of the iris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Megaloblastic anemia is not typically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Treatment:** Cysteine supplementation and high-dose pyridoxine (B6), as B6 is a cofactor for cystathionine beta synthase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Pyridoxine helps reduce homosysteine levels by increasing cystathionine beta synthase activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

### Non-Classic Homocystinuria
*   **Biochemical Impact:** Low methionine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> and normal cysteine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) Deficiency:** Leads to impaired formation of N5-methyl THF, which is crucial for homocysteine remethylation to methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Megaloblastic anemia is **not** seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   **Methyl B12 Formation Defect:** Affects the remethylation pathway, leading to low methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Megaloblastic anemia is typically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

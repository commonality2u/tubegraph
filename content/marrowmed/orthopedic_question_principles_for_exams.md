This article discusses key principles for tackling orthopedic questions in medical examinations, drawing insights from the NPG 2024 Orthopedics recall questions. The focus is on understanding underlying concepts rather than memorizing exact answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Exam Structure and Question Nature
The NPG 2024 Orthopedics section had two sessions (morning and evening), with the evening session perceived as slightly more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Orthopedics questions were evenly distributed in terms of paper balance and topics across both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Each session included approximately seven purely orthopedic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Orthopedics frequently overlaps with Radiology and Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Common Question Types and Topics
Questions often require [[second_order_thinking_in_medical_exams_preparation | second-order thinking]], where candidates first identify a diagnosis from an image (e.g., X-ray) and then apply knowledge of its classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Some questions are straightforward, while others can be tricky or considered "unfair" due to advanced concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Basic science questions may also be presented in a complex manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

Common topics tested include:
*   Basic Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Metabolic Bone Disease (noted in Session 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Upper Limb Trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Lower Limb Trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Oncology (Orthopedic aspect, noted in Paper 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Spine injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Sports Injury (noted in Session 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### General [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | Approach to Questions]]
*   **Focus on Principles:** When discussing recall questions, the emphasis is on the principles behind them, allowing candidates to tackle modified questions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Rule out Options:** A useful strategy is to systematically rule out incorrect options based on the available information and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

## Key Orthopedic Concepts Tested

### Amputations
*   **Disarticulation:** Separation at a joint (e.g., hip or knee disarticulation) without bone cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Amputation:** Involves cutting through bone.
    *   **Below-knee amputation:** Results in a stump with two bones (tibia and fibula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Above-knee amputation:** Results in a stump with one bone (femur) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   **Midfoot amputations:** Lisfranc (tarsometatarsal joint) and Chopart (intertarsal joint) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Pediatric Fractures and Deformities
*   **Supracondylar Humeral Fracture:**
    *   Common in children, often involves posterior displacement (extension type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
    *   **Gartland Classification:**
        *   Type 1: Undisplaced (indirect signs: fat pad sign, sail sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
        *   Type 2: Anterior cortex broken, posterior intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
        *   Type 3: Both anterior and posterior cortices broken (complete fracture with displacement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   **Complications:** Most common is malunion, leading to cubitus varus deformity (gunstock deformity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   **Nerve/Artery Injuries:** Most common nerve injured is anterior interosseous nerve (more than median nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Most common artery injured is brachial artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
    *   **Delayed Complication:** Myositis ossificans, typically seen in patients who underwent massage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Lateral Condyle Humeral Fracture:** Injury to the germinal layer of the growth plate, preventing lateral condyle growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This leads to cubitus valgus deformity because the medial condyle continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. It can eventually cause tardy ulnar nerve palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Growth Plate Injuries
*   **Salter-Harris Classification:** Used for growth plate (epiphyseal/physeal) injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
    *   **Mnemonics:** S.A.L.T.E.R. (Slip/Straight, Above, Lower, Through, Rammed/ERasure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Layers of the growth plate: Germinal, proliferative, hypertrophic, calcification, ossification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
    *   Most important layer: Germinal layer (if injured, longitudinal growth affected) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
    *   Weakest and most commonly injured layer: Hypertrophic layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### Bone Tumors
*   **Ewing Sarcoma:**
    *   Malignant tumor in children, typically in the second decade of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
    *   Commonly affects femoral diaphysis, more common in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Presentation:** Often mimics infection with fever and raised ESR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Fever is a poor prognostic factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Aspirated content may look like pus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
    *   **Radiographic Features:** Aggressive periosteal reaction: onion peel appearance (usual), but can also show sunray/sunburst appearance or Codman's triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. These are characteristic of rapidly growing malignant tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Best made by biopsy showing small round blue cells with pseudorosettes, PAS positive, and diastase digestible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   **Molecular Features:** EWS gene mutation, CD99 IHC positivity, and translocation t(11;22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Spine Fractures
*   **Chance Fracture (Jackknife Fracture):**
    *   Mechanism: Flexion and distraction force (e.g., from old lap seatbelts in motor vehicle accidents causing the body to flex over the belt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   Involves all three columns of the spine (posterior to anterior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
    *   Can be bony or soft tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Fracture of Spinous Process (Clay Shoveler's Fracture):**
    *   Involves posterior elements of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
    *   Usually in cervical spine due to forceful Upper Limb use or strong paraspinal muscle contracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Compression Fracture:**
    *   Occurs when bones soften, typically in osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
    *   Results in wedge compression, where the anterior wall becomes shorter than the posterior wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Burst Fracture:**
    *   Caused by axial loading (e.g., fall from height) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   Fragments burst anteriorly and posteriorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Lumbar Spine Conditions
*   **Disc Prolapse:**
    *   Most common type is paracentral disc prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   Compresses the traversing nerve root (the one taking a longer path) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   Example: L4/L5 disc prolapse compresses L5 nerve root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   Rare far lateral disc prolapse compresses the exiting nerve root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   Example: L5/S1 disc prolapse compresses S1 nerve root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Spondylolisthesis:**
    *   Slipping of one vertebra over another, most commonly at L5-S1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
    *   Clinical sign: Step sign (prominent spinous process felt on palpation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   Often due to a fracture in the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis), breaking the continuity of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
    *   If slipping is severe, it's called spondyloptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

### Lower Limb Trauma
*   **Fifth Metatarsal Fracture (Jones Fracture):**
    *   Fracture at the base of the fifth metatarsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
    *   Notorious for delayed union, fibrous union, or nonunion due to poor blood supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
    *   Conservative treatment (short leg cast with POP) typically requires 6-8 weeks, longer than typical 4-6 week cast immobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   If conservative treatment fails, intramedullary screw fixation can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Osteoporosis
*   **Biomarkers:**
    *   Osteoporosis involves an imbalance where osteoblastic activity is less than osteoclastic activity, leading to bone resorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
    *   **Bone Resorption Markers:** N-telopeptide and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) are elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. TRAP is found in osteoclasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
    *   **Bone Formation Markers:** Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is found in osteoblasts and is elevated with increased bone formation, which happens subsequent to bone resorption, indicating increased bone turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Fracture Healing
Fracture healing mechanisms depend on stability at the fracture site:
*   **Primary Healing (Direct Healing):**
    *   Occurs with rigid fixation (absolute stability, no movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
    *   Typically achieved by compression plating or lag screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   No callus formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
    *   Occurs via intramembranous ossification (bone grows within bone without cartilage formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.
*   **Secondary Healing (Indirect Healing):**
    *   Occurs with relative stability (some micro-movement, tension, or torsion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
    *   Results in callus formation, making it a stronger and often better healing method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.
    *   Common with natural healing, intramedullary nailing, bridge plating, non-rigid fixations, braces, or external fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
    *   Involves endochondral ossification (cartilage formation followed by bone formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Creeping Substitution:** A process where bone graft is replaced by natural bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

Age estimation is a crucial aspect of [[forensic_medicine_and_toxicology_in_neetpg_2024 | forensic medicine and toxicology]] cases, particularly when there is a discrepancy in an individual's claimed age versus their apparent age, or when an individual's legal status (e.g., as a juvenile or adult) needs to be established for criminal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Methods of Age Estimation: Radiographs

Radiographs (X-rays) are commonly used to estimate age by assessing the fusion of epiphyseal plates in various joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For confirming an age of 18 years, specific joints are indicative:

*   **Shoulder Joint:** Complete fusion indicates approximately 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Elbow Joint:** Complete fusion of all centers indicates around 16 to 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Wrist Joint:** Fusion typically occurs between 18 to 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Hip Joint:** The complete fusion of the upper end of the femur is indicative of 17 to 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Ankle Joint:** Indicates approximately 17 to 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Knee Joint:** Fusion is typically observed between 18 to 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

For establishing an age of 18 years, the wrist and knee joints are commonly used as they show fusion around this age range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Skull radiographs are primarily used for suture closure, not for assessing joint fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Legal Implications

The estimation of age is crucial in cases involving juveniles, as their criminal responsibility differs from that of adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition: Juvenile
> A "juvenile" is defined as a person less than 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Heinous Crime
> A "heinous crime" is any offense that carries a punishment of more than 7 years of imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

If a person aged between 16 and 18 years commits a heinous crime, such as rape, they can be tried as an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

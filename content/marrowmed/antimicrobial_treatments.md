Dr. Abdul Nasir (Dr. Blueprint) presented a microbiology recall session for the INSA May 2025 exam, highlighting that 85% to 90% of the questions were covered by his 13-hour revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article summarizes key information regarding microbial identification, diagnosis, and [[drug_of_choice_for_specific_infections_and_conditions | treatment strategies]] as discussed in the recall session.

## Microbial Identification and Diagnostics

### Bacterial Identification Tests
Various laboratory tests are used to identify bacteria based on their unique properties:
*   **Satellitism** A phenomenon where *Haemophilus influenzae* grows near *Staphylococcus aureus* on blood agar, observed as smaller colonies surrounding the *S. aureus* streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. *Staphylococcus aureus* provides essential growth factors (like X and V factors) that *Haemophilus influenzae* needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Elek precipitation test** Used for *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Coagulase test** Positive for *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **String test** Positive for *Vibrio cholerae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* (which causes gastroenteritis and wound infections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Quellung test** Detects the capsule of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Catalase test** Positive for *Staphylococcus* species, but negative for *Streptococcus*, *Pneumococcus*, and *Enterococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Immunoglobulin Structures
Antibodies exhibit distinct morphological forms:
*   **Monomers** Immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgE, and IgD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Serum IgA is also a monomer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Dimer** Secretory IgA is found as a dimer, composed of two units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Pentamer** IgM exists as a pentamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Agglutination Tests
These serological tests detect antibodies in patient samples, usually becoming positive from the second week of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>:
*   **Widal test** For *Salmonella* (typhoid fever), positive from the second week of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT)** For *Leptospira* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Weil-Felix agglutination test** For Rickettsial infections (typhus fever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Standard agglutination test** For *Brucella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Fungal Morphology and Stains
*   **Thermal Dimorphic Fungi** These fungi exist in two forms depending on temperature (mold at room temperature, yeast at body temperature). Examples include *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, *Paracoccidioides*, *Sporothrix schenckii*, and *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. *Cryptococcus neoformans* is a yeast, not a dimorphic fungus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Fungal Stains**
    *   Commonly used fungal stains include Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
    *   **Masson-Fontana stain** Stains melanin pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Some *Aspergillus* species (*A. niger*, *A. fumigatus*) produce melanin pigment, making this stain potentially useful for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
    *   **Congo Red stain** Primarily stains amyloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, but can also stain fungal cell walls, though it is not a preferred or clear stain for fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## Specific Infections and Treatments

### Parasitic Infections
*   **Helminths causing Auto-infection**
    *   Most common: *Strongyloides* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   Others: *Hymenolepis nana*, *Enterobius vermicularis*, and *Taenia solium* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   A protozoan causing auto-infection is *Cryptosporidium* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Protozoa with Morphological Forms**
    *   **Two forms (trophozoite and cyst):** Intestinal protozoa (e.g., *Giardia*), and free-living protozoa (e.g., *Naegleria*, *Acanthamoeba*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   **One form (trophozoite only):** Vaginal protozoa, specifically *Trichomonas vaginalis* (cysts are absent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii)**
    *   Definitive host: Cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   Intermediate hosts: Mammals (humans, sheep, cattle, goats) and birds (hens, ducks, pigeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   Oocysts in cat feces are not infective; they become infective after sporulation in the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   Infection in pregnant mothers is more common in the third trimester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   *Toxoplasma* is non-cultivable in standard media but can be cultured in the peritoneal cavity of mice or in Vero cell culture (tissue culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **[[Treatment strategies for malaria | Malaria Treatment]]**
    *   **For *Plasmodium vivax***:
        *   **Clinical cure**: Chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
        *   **Radical cure (preventing relapse)**: Primaquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
        *   **Transmission cure (killing gametocytes)**: Chloroquine and Primaquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.
    *   **For *Plasmodium falciparum***:
        *   **Clinical cure**: Artemisinin, Pyrimethamine, and Sulfadoxine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
        *   **Transmission cure (killing gametocytes)**: Primaquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
        *   There is no radical cure needed for *P. falciparum* as there is no relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
    *   Primaquine is generally not involved in clinical cure but in radical and transmission cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

### Bacterial Infections
*   **Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Infection**
    *   Infects half of the global population but doesn't always lead to peptic ulcer disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Reasons for asymptomatic infection: Host factors (genetics), environmental factors (socioeconomic status, hygiene), and bacterial virulence factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   *H. pylori* typically colonizes the gastric antrum and can spread throughout the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Infections are often asymptomatic but do not resolve spontaneously; they require [[Drug of choice for specific infections and conditions | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Enterobiasis (Pinworm Infection)**
    *   Caused by *Enterobius vermicularis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

*   **Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)**
    *   **Syphilis**
        *   Caused by *Treponema pallidum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
        *   Stages: Primary (transient genital ulcer), Secondary (rashes on palms and soles), Latent (asymptomatic), Tertiary (gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, aortic aneurysm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

*   **Tuberculosis (Spinal Tuberculosis)**
    *   Diagnosis for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*:
        *   First step: Acid-fast stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
        *   Second step (WHO recommended investigation of choice): CBNAAT (Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test), which detects the gene in 2-3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
        *   Third step: IGRA (Interferon-Gamma Release Assay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
        *   Culture is the best diagnostic method but is slow (1.5-2 months for results) and thus not preferred for initial diagnosis where rapid results are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
        *   Radiology (X-ray, CT scan) can show deformity but cannot identify the organism or antibody, thus cannot be the final diagnosis for infectious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **[[Diagnosing and managing bone infections | Osteomyelitis]]**
    *   Most common cause: *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

### Fungal Infections
*   **Esophageal Candidiasis**
    *   Common in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV with low CD4 count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
    *   Symptoms: Painful swallowing, retrosternal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   Diagnosis: Endoscopy shows white patches in the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.
    *   Microscopic findings: Budding yeast cells with pseudohyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

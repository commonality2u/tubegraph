Multiple Myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that can be treated with various drugs, often used in different regimens (e.g., two, three, or four-drug combinations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. [[use_of_marrow_for_medical_studies | Bortezomib]] is frequently included in most treatment regimens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Key Drugs and Their Mechanisms

Several classes of drugs are used to target multiple myeloma cells:

*   **Lenalidomide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
    *   **Class:** Immunomodulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Daratumumab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   **Mechanism:** Blocks CD38, a protein overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Bortezomib** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   **Mechanism:** Proteasome inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Elotuzumab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
    *   **Mechanism:** Blocks a factor that causes activation of T lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Associated Risks

Immunosuppression induced by these treatments can lead to specific side effects:

*   **Herpes Zoster Reactivation and New Infections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
    *   This risk is generally present whenever the immune system is suppressed, such as with steroid use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   The incidence of herpes zoster reactivation is notably higher with [[use_of_marrow_for_medical_studies | Bortezomib]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Management of Risks

*   When [[use_of_marrow_for_medical_studies | Bortezomib]] is used for multiple myeloma treatment, prophylactic acyclovir (e.g., oral 400 micrograms) is given to prevent herpes zoster reactivation or new herpes virus infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

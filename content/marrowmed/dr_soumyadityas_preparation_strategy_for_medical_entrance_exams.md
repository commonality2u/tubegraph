Dr. Soumyaditya achieved an All India Rank 2 in the INI CET exam [00:00:13]. Born and brought up in Kolkata, he completed his schooling from South Point High School and his MBBS from Medical College Kolkata, the oldest institution in Asia [00:07:09]. His parents emphasized the importance of having a philosophy in life, not just pursuing a career in a "rat race" [00:05:53]. He is considered a devoted son, always thinking about his parents and guiding them [00:04:21].

## Early and Consistent Preparation
Dr. Soumyaditya subscribed to Marrow early in his third year of MBBS [00:07:50]. This allowed him to start watching videos for subjects like ENT, Community Medicine, and Ophthalmology, and complete parts of bigger final year subjects like Medicine, Surgery, OBGYN, and Pediatrics [00:07:57]. By the time he entered his final year, he had viewed all third and fourth-year subject videos [00:08:20]. After his final MBBS exams, he revisited first and second-year subjects, completing them by mid-internship [00:08:34].

His consistency was a defining factor; even after securing a good rank in NEET PG, he remained determined to attempt the November INI CET with full effort [00:13:10].

## Study Materials and Notes
Dr. Soumyaditya primarily used Marrow's printed notes from Edition 5, marking and adding extra points directly onto them while watching videos [00:09:44]. He also selectively watched videos from Edition 6 and incorporated those updates into his existing notes [00:10:03].

He embraced the evolving nature of the medical field, understanding that new editions and updates are necessary as new drugs and recent advancements appear in exams like INI CET [00:10:50]. He did not let the fear of missing out (FOMO) on new editions disturb his [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques]] [00:10:41].

## Revision Cycles
By the mid-internship, Dr. Soumyaditya had completed one full round of all 19 subjects [00:16:47]. For clinical subjects, he always used the main video notes, brushing through topics quickly, as he found more confidence in them compared to revision videos [00:17:56]. He completed two to three cycles of main subjects and about two cycles for shorter subjects before the NEET PG exam [00:18:35].

For first and second professional subjects, he watched main videos for selective topics and read the rest from revision notes and the QBank [00:17:22].

## [[Utilizing Question Banks for Competitive Medical Exams | Utilizing Question Banks]] and MCQs
Dr. Soumyaditya solved the QBank after watching a chunk of videos, specifically 10 to 12 videos related to a particular topic [00:14:52]. He completed the entire QBank before his May exam and before starting Grand Tests (GTS) [00:15:52]. He understood that solving the QBank only once was insufficient and that multiple revisions of his mistakes were necessary to rectify them in the actual exam [00:16:00].

He used the bookmarking feature (star and question mark) to differentiate questions and revisited these bookmarked questions during subsequent revision cycles [00:16:11]. The previous year questions (PYQs) in the QBank were his favorite feature due to their authenticity, clear explanations, and coverage of possible future exam points [00:20:13]. He revised all 19 subjects' PYQs from the QBank two to three weeks before the exam [00:20:37].

He also utilized McQ discussion videos, pausing them to attempt answers and then watching explanations, finding them to be an interactive and relaxing way to study [00:19:00].

## Grand Tests (GTS) and Mock Exams
Dr. Soumyaditya started giving GTS from mid-internship, after completing one revision cycle [00:22:04]. Initially, his GT ranks were good (50-60), but they dipped to around 400-500 as more subscribers joined [00:22:16]. This dip motivated him to prepare more and become "exam ready," prompting another revision cycle [00:22:38]. Before the exam, his GT ranks improved again to around 20-30 [00:22:51].

When his GT scores dipped, he focused on revising his weakest subjects more thoroughly, while reviewing stronger subjects superficially [00:23:00]. He made it a point to give GTS live to avoid them becoming a future liability [00:23:37].

For the INI CET national mock test, his rank was 47 [00:25:18]. He consciously detached his emotions from this rank, choosing to focus on his preparation rather than the mock test outcome [00:25:32].

## Managing Internship and Studies
During his hectic internship, Dr. Soumyaditya utilized the small time he had after returning home before sleep for studying [00:24:10]. He also leveraged free time during postings in lighter departments [00:24:25]. He found that studying during internship allowed him to relate theoretical knowledge from videos and notes to practical, real-world scenarios he observed in the wards [00:24:51].

## Key Insights and Advice
Dr. Soumyaditya emphasizes that success in these exams is not just about the last few months of [[study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams | study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]], but a culmination of effort throughout MBBS and internship [00:27:37]. He stresses the importance of attending internship and gaining clinical experience from wards and patients, as many exam questions come directly from ward experiences [00:27:48]. This practical knowledge gained by looking at patients cannot be substituted by any video [00:28:09].

His journey exemplifies that consistency and a strong mindset, even when faced with challenges or good existing ranks, are crucial for achieving top results [00:13:55]. He did not expect a rank of 2 after the INI CET exam, initially feeling distressed and thinking he made silly mistakes [00:26:25]. He attempted 190 questions in the exam [00:26:37].

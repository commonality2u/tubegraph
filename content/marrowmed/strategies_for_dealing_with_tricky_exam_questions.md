Successfully navigating tricky questions in competitive medical exams like INI CET requires specific [[problemsolving_strategies_in_exams | strategies]] and an understanding of one's own approach. Dr. Bhavik Chrani, who achieved an All India Rank 10 in INI CET May 2023, shares his insights on how to tackle these challenging questions.

## Early Exposure and Consistent Practice

Dr. Bhavik emphasizes the importance of starting exam preparation early to develop an understanding of one's [[problemsolving_strategies_in_exams | question-solving patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Regular practice with [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | Grand Tests (GTs)]] and [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question banks]] allows for an evolution in how one approaches questions.

Initially, Dr. Bhavik tended to leave many questions unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, through consistent practice with GTs, he became more aggressive in his approach. He realized that his initial thoughts were often correct, which built confidence to mark more answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Specific Strategies for Tricky Questions

*   **Initial Skipping and Reviewing**: When encountering a tricky question or one where the answer isn't immediately clear, it's advisable to skip it initially and mark it for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This prevents getting stuck and losing valuable time.
*   **Revisiting with a Fresh Perspective**: Returning to the marked questions later can offer a different point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Often, simply re-reading the question and considering the options after a break can make a seemingly difficult question appear simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Elimination Strategy**: Dr. Bhavik's strong point was his ability to rule out options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. By focusing on the last line of the question and systematically eliminating incorrect choices, he gained both speed and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Calmness**: A [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | calm mind]] is crucial for effective problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Dr. Bhavik attributes his calmness to his good preparation, which instills confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. Seeing one's rank in final mock tests (like the last Marrow GT) being close to the actual exam rank can also boost confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Dealing with New/Difficult Questions in Practice

When practicing with [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | custom modules]] or new questions just before the exam, it's common to encounter unfamiliar or difficult problems. Dr. Bhavik advises to continue solving them, even if it feels daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This "conditioning" prepares one for potentially difficult questions in the actual exam, making the exam feel like just "another question test or GT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Instead of avoiding mistakes in practice, students should embrace them in [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question banks]] to learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

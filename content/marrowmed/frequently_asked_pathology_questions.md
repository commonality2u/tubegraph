This module provides an in-depth analysis of pathology questions featured in the November 2024 INICET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The overall difficulty level of the exam was considered moderate, with most students noting that questions were not direct but required a good understanding of revised subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Pathology accounted for approximately 20 to 25 questions, often with overlaps into other subjects, highlighting its importance as a core subject connecting medicine, surgery, and gynecology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

    *   **Explanation:** The pentad of TTP (MAHA) is: Fever, Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA), Thrombocytopenia, Renal abnormalities, and Neurological abnormalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. While microthrombi occur, macroscopic thrombi are not a primary component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

### Cell Biology and Metastasis

*   **Question 19: Epithelial-carcinoma transition is induced by which pair of transcription factors?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>

    *   **Explanation:** These transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process involved in metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

### Modes of Inheritance

*   **Question 20: Match the following with appropriate mode of inheritance:** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>
    *   Autosomal Recessive: [[cystic_fibrosis | Cystic Fibrosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>
    *   Mitochondrial: Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>
    *   X-linked Recessive: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>
    *   Trinucleotide Repeat: Spinal Muscular Atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>
    *   **Mitochondrial Inheritance Key Points:** Exclusively maternally inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>, affects brain, eye, skeletal muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Mutation is called heteroplasmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

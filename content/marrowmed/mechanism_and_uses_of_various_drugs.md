The following content discusses various drugs, their [[mechanism_of_action_of_specific_pharmaceutical_agents | mechanism of action]], uses, and associated concepts, as observed in [[pharmacology_mcqs_in_inicet_2025 | Pharmacology MCQs in INICET 2025]] (May) [00:00:08]. Overall, the pharmacology MCQs were of moderate difficulty, requiring conceptual understanding [00:00:12].

## Carbamazepine and Erythromycin: A Case of Drug-Drug Interaction

A case study involved an 8-year-old patient on carbamazepine who developed imbalance and gait ataxia after taking erythromycin for an infection [00:00:21].

*   **Symptoms:** Imbalance and gait ataxia are symptoms of cerebellar toxicity [00:01:21]. They are not typical symptoms of epilepsy relapse [00:01:02], erythromycin toxicity [00:01:11], or hypersensitivity reactions [00:01:18].
*   **Diagnosis:** The patient developed [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | carbamazepine toxicity]] [00:01:34].
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Carbamazepine and phenytoin are known to cause cerebellar toxicity, presenting as ataxia and dysarthria [00:01:42].
    *   Erythromycin is an enzyme inhibitor [00:02:09]. It inhibited the [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] of carbamazepine, leading to increased levels of the drug and an elevated risk of cerebellar toxicity [00:02:13].

## [[types_of_drug_tolerance | Types of Drug Tolerance]]

Different forms of [[types_of_drug_tolerance | drug tolerance]] include acute tolerance, reverse tolerance, and cross tolerance [00:02:23].

### Acute Tolerance
*   **Definition:** Rapid tolerance developing with repeated use on a single occasion, such as during a binge [00:05:52]. The patient does not get the expected response from the usual dose [00:03:07].
*   **Examples:** Alcohol and cocaine [00:02:41].
*   **Consequence:** Patients may increase the dose, leading to [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | toxicity]] or overdose [00:03:10].

### Reverse Tolerance
*   **Definition:** An increase in response with repeated administration of the same dose of the drug [00:06:09]. The effect of the drug begins to increase over time [00:03:49].
*   **Example:** Cannabis [00:03:54].
*   **Mechanism (Cannabis):** Cannabis is stored in body tissues, so subsequent doses may not need to be as high to achieve the same effect, as there's already a tissue store [00:04:10].

### Cross Tolerance
*   **Definition:** When tolerance developed to one drug automatically leads to tolerance to another drug [00:04:25].
*   **Example:** Alcohol and benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) [00:04:48].
*   **Mechanism:** Alcohol acts on GABA-A receptors [00:04:50]. Benzodiazepines are also GABA-A agonists [00:05:23]. If a patient develops tolerance to alcohol, they will also exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines, potentially requiring higher doses of the benzodiazepine [00:05:28].

## [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | Drug Metabolism Phases and Functions]]

Drug [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] generally occurs in two phases [00:07:00]:

### Phase One Reactions
*   **Function:** Involves breaking down the drug molecule [00:07:11] and introducing a functional group to the drug [00:07:23].
*   **Purpose of Functional Group:** The functional group is essential for the drug to bind to a conjugate in Phase Two [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] [00:07:49].

### Phase Two Reactions (Conjugation)
*   **Function:** Attaching a conjugate (which is usually negatively charged) to the drug [00:07:45].
*   **Outcome:** Makes the entire drug molecule negatively charged, ionized, and water-soluble [00:08:04]. Water solubility is crucial for drug excretion [00:08:13].

## Thalidomide: Uses and Side Effects

Thalidomide is a drug with various uses and side effects [00:09:01].

*   **Uses (Mnemonic: CATCH PROGRAMS):**
    *   **C**apl [00:09:15]
    *   **P**ancreatic cancer [00:09:15]
    *   **R**heumatoid arthritis [00:09:17]
    *   **O**rogenital syndrome (Behcet's disease) [00:09:17]
    *   **G**VSD (Graft-versus-host disease) [00:09:22]
    *   **R**enal cell cancer [00:09:23]
    *   **A**IDS-related wasting [00:09:25]
    *   **M**ultiple myeloma [00:09:26]
    *   **M**elanoma [00:09:32]
    *   **M**yelodysplasia [00:09:34]
    *   **E**N**L** (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum) [00:09:35]
    *   **S**arcoidosis [00:09:39]
*   **Side Effects (Mnemonic: IN SPORT CHANNEL):**
    *   **S**edation [00:09:46]
    *   **P**hocomelia (teratogenic effects) [00:09:47]
    *   **R**ash [00:09:50]
    *   **T**hrombocytopenia [00:09:51]
    *   **C**onstipation [00:09:52]
    *   The most common side effects are sedation and constipation [00:09:53].
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   It is used in multiple myeloma [00:10:37].
    *   It is used for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) [00:10:41].
    *   It is teratogenic [00:10:44].
    *   Its immunosuppressive action is *not* due to anti-metabolic effects [00:10:05]. Anti-metabolite drugs typically inhibit folate (e.g., methotrexate) or are purine/pyrimidine analogs (e.g., azathioprine, leflunomide) [00:10:10].

## GnRH Receptor Antagonists

GnRH receptor antagonists typically end in "-golix" or "-relix" (e.g., elagolix) [00:11:03].

*   **Mechanism:** These drugs decrease the release of LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) [00:11:23].
*   **Consequences:** This leads to a decrease in estrogen in females and testosterone in males [00:11:27].
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Endometriosis:** Because endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition, decreasing estrogen helps manage it [00:11:38].
    *   **Prostate Cancer:** As prostate cancer is a testosterone-dependent condition, decreasing testosterone is beneficial [00:11:47].
    *   **Controlled Ovulation (in IVF):** By decreasing LH, these antagonists prevent premature ovulation, allowing for timed ovulation, which is crucial in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures [00:12:54].

*   **Clinical Application:** They are used for the management of advanced prostate cancer [00:13:41] and for controlled ovulation [00:13:46]. They are not used for hypogonadal hypogonadism in males [00:13:26].

## Drug-Induced Cholestasis

Some drugs can cause cholestasis without portal inflammation [00:13:53].

*   **Mechanism:** Certain drugs like estrogen, erythromycin, and cyclosporin are transported out of hepatocytes by the P-glycoprotein pump (MDR1 pump), similar to bile acids [00:14:37]. When these drugs are administered, they compete with bile acids for this pump, inhibiting bile acid excretion and leading to cholestasis [00:14:52].
*   **Examples:** Estrogen and androgenic steroids are known to cause cholestasis without portal inflammation [00:15:22].

## Fenoldopam for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

Fenoldopam is a drug used to improve renal function, particularly in acute kidney injury (AKI) [00:15:34].

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Fenoldopam is a D1 agonist, similar to dopexamine [00:16:09]. Both produce renal vasodilation, leading to diuresis [00:16:17].
    *   Specifically, D1 receptor agonism causes dilation of afferent and efferent arterioles, increasing the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) [00:17:02].
    *   Fenoldopam is also an alpha-2 agonist, which, through central sympatholysis, helps decrease blood pressure [00:16:27]. (Dopexamine, in contrast, is a beta-2 agonist which also causes vasodilation and decreases blood pressure [00:16:38]).

## Loading Dose Calculation

Calculating the loading dose of a drug depends on several parameters [00:17:32].

*   **Formula (IV Route):**
    *   Loading Dose (IV) = Volume of Distribution (VD) x Target Plasma Concentration (CT) [00:19:09].
    *   VD is the volume of distribution [00:17:55].
    *   CT is the target plasma concentration required for disease treatment [00:18:43].
    *   For IV administration, bioavailability (F) is assumed to be 1 [00:19:34].
*   **Formula (Oral or Other Non-IV Route):**
    *   Loading Dose (Oral) = (Volume of Distribution (VD) x Target Plasma Concentration (CT)) / Bioavailability (F) [00:20:29].
    *   For non-IV routes, bioavailability (F) is less than 1 and must be accounted for [00:20:11].
*   **Parameters:** The loading dose for an orally given drug depends on bioavailability, volume of distribution, and target plasma concentration [00:20:45]. It does not depend on half-life [00:20:50].

## Drug Classification Schedules

Drugs are classified into different schedules based on their properties and dispensing regulations [00:21:11].

*   **Schedule X:** Drugs with high abuse potential (e.g., morphine, amphetamine, ketamine) belong to Schedule X [00:21:28].
*   **Schedule H:** Drugs that can be given with a valid prescription [00:22:43]. Vaccines are an example [00:22:22].
*   **Schedule G:** Drugs that should not be taken without medical supervision [00:22:47]. Insulin is an example [00:22:30]. Essentially, every Schedule H drug also falls under Schedule G [00:22:52].
*   **Schedule Z:** This schedule is for veterinary drugs [00:22:04].

## Bempedoic Acid

Bempedoic acid is a newer drug used in the management of dyslipidemia [00:23:01].

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Cholesterol synthesis involves enzymes like ATP citrate lyase and HMG-CoA reductase [00:23:10]. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase [00:23:24].
    *   Bempedoic acid is a prodrug [00:24:14] that forms bempedoic co-enzyme A, which competitively inhibits ATP citrate lyase [00:24:17].
*   **Properties:**
    *   It is a dicarboxylic acid [00:24:34].
    *   It inhibits cholesterol synthesis [00:24:41].
    *   It is used in dyslipidemia, especially in cases resistant to statins, due to polymorphism in HMG-CoA reductase [00:24:25].
    *   It is a competitive inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase [00:25:07].

## Imipramine and Diphenhydramine: Receptor Interactions

This interaction involves a tricyclic antidepressant and an antihistamine [00:25:22].

*   **Diphenhydramine:** An H1 blocker and a highly sedative drug [00:25:37]. It is primarily preferred for its anti-muscarinic effects [00:25:49].
*   **Imipramine:** A tricyclic antidepressant that increases norepinephrine and serotonin by inhibiting their reuptake [00:26:01].
*   **Commonality:** Both diphenhydramine and imipramine block muscarinic receptors [00:26:11].
*   **Pharmacological Relationship:** Both drugs block muscarinic receptors [00:26:42]. Neither drug is described as inhibiting the other's [[drug_metabolism_phases_and_functions | metabolism]] [00:26:34].

This discussion covers key pharmacological concepts and drug properties relevant to medical entrance examinations. While some questions may be challenging, understanding fundamental principles and drug mechanisms can lead to correct answers [00:26:40].

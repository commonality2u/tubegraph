Dr. Rohan, an INIC November 2024 Rank 7 achiever, shares his detailed study strategy, emphasizing the [[utilizing_online_resources_like_marrow_effectively | effective utilization of Marrow resources]], particularly the QBank and Grand Tests, in his journey to secure a top rank.

### Marrow Journey: From Adjunct to Primary Resource

Dr. Rohan first subscribed to Marrow in his second year of MBBS, initially using it as an adjunct to his regular coursework rather than for PG preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. He began taking Marrow more seriously in his third and fourth years, after completing his USMLE Step 1 exam, focusing on integrating it with his MBBS curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. During this period, he watched most of the third and fourth-year subject videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

#### Preferred Faculty and Notes
Dr. Rohan specifically highlighted Dr. Rohan Khandelwal for surgery and Dr. Rakesh for medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. He appreciated Dr. Rakesh's ability to simplify complex topics and teach them in a clinical context, which made general medicine less overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

He primarily used the ready-made notes provided in the Marrow app, as he was not a "big fan" of writing his own notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

#### Correlating Marrow with Textbooks
A distinctive part of Dr. Rohan's strategy was correlating Marrow videos with standard textbooks, a practice less common among students today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Surgery:** After watching Dr. Khandelwal's videos, he read Bailey & Love. He found that the video structure mirrored Bailey's, making the textbook easier to navigate and identify important topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **ENT:** He first watched Dr. M's videos and then read Dingra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

He advised that watching videos before reading textbooks makes the process faster and enhances understanding, especially for undergraduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

#### Bridging Marrow Editions
Dr. Rohan noted that the actual content across older (Edition 5/6) and newer (Edition 8) Marrow editions doesn't differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. He recommended that students who have studied older editions should revise their old notes and only add new, updated points from the newer editions, rather than re-watching all new edition videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

### [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | Effective Use of QBank and Test Series]]

Dr. Rohan identified insufficient [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams | utilization of the Marrow question bank for competitive exams]] as a major error in his May attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Post-May exam, he adopted a disciplined approach to the QBank.

#### QBank Strategy
*   **Daily Target:** He aimed to complete at least 10 Marrow QBank modules (out of 829 total) daily, maintaining this routine from the end of May to the end of October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. This consistent effort was akin to "running your own Marathon," fostering discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Accountability Group:** He formed a group with batchmates to hold each other accountable for meeting their daily module targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This strategy proved highly effective, as evidenced by his friend securing Rank 116 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Habit Formation:** He acknowledged that the daily target initially feels like a "chore" but becomes a habit after about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

#### Bookmark Strategy
Dr. Rohan employed a meticulous bookmarking strategy to facilitate revision and spatial repetition:
*   **Type 1:** Recent NEET and AIIMS questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Type 2:** Incorrectly answered MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **Type 3:** MCQs where he was confused between two options, common in INIC exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

He created 3-4 "custom modules" daily, composed solely of his bookmarks, allowing him to revise old bookmarks while also practicing new MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. This method served as his form of spatial repetition, akin to using flashcards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

#### [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively | Strategies for using Marrow Grand Tests Effectively]] (GTs)
Dr. Rohan viewed Grand Tests as "experiments" to refine his exam strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Experimentation:** In different GTs, he experimented with various approaches, such as attempting all MCQs, leaving doubtful questions, or aiming for 190+ attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** He started giving a GT every week after his May attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Finalizing Strategy:** He finalized his exam strategy about a month before the INIC exam (end of October), deciding to attempt 194 questions in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
*   **Mindset:** He cautioned against taking GT scores too seriously or falling into "post-GT depression." He stressed that GTs are merely tools to assess one's standing and identify areas for improvement, not reflections of final exam marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

### Marrow Pearls
Dr. Rohan found Marrow Pearls to be an excellent tool for a quick overview of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. He utilized them during the final 10 days of his preparation, going through pearls he had bookmarked previously, especially those related to incorrect MCQs or important PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Aspirants
*   **Discipline:** Dr. Rohan's journey highlights the importance of discipline and perseverance, especially as this was his third INIC attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on MCQs:** He emphasized that competitive exams like INIC test one's ability to solve MCQs rather than just factual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.
*   **QBank Overload of Notes:** While rapid revision and notes are good, a strong focus on [[importance_of_using_a_qbank_for_exam_preparation | QBank for exam preparation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. His father further attested to the effectiveness of the [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | Marrow videos and Q Bank]], noting that Dr. Rohan did not attend any external coaching centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>.
*   **Support System:** The mental support from his parents, both doctors, was invaluable during challenging phases of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.

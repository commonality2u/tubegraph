This article discusses recall questions in pediatrics from the [[INICET May 2025 preparation strategies | INICET May 2025 exam]], as presented by Dr. Singarum, a pediatrics faculty member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The exam featured a mix of questions from expected topics (PYQs, PYTS), new questions, and older questions that reappeared, such as Marasmus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The paper included a range of difficulty, from easy to tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Question 1: Tetralogy of Fallot Components

**Case:** A mother brings a child born at home without complications, who shows cyanosis on crying and a noticeable systolic murmur. The diagnosis is Tetralogy of Fallot.
**Question:** Which of the following is seen in this condition?
A. Left ventricle hypertrophy
B. Pulmonary infundibular stenosis
C. Interatrial septal defect
D. Transposition of great vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

**Discussion:**
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) has four classic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
1.  Overriding aorta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
2.  Pulmonary stenosis (specifically, infundibular pulmonary stenosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
3.  Ventricular septal defect (VSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
4.  Right ventricular hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

*   Option A (Left ventricle hypertrophy) is incorrect; TOF causes right ventricular hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Option C (Interatrial septal defect) is incorrect; it's a ventricular septal defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Option D (Transposition of great vessels) is unrelated to TOF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   The systolic murmur in TOF is typically due to pulmonary infundibular stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

**Answer:** B. Pulmonary infundibular stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## Question 2: Breastfeeding Jaundice Mechanism

**Case:** A neonate presents with jaundice due to breastfeeding.
**Question:** This can be due to fatty acid inhibition of which of the following mechanisms?
A. Intracellular binding of protein
B. Hepatic uptake of bilirubin
C. Conjugation of bilirubin
D. Excretion of conjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

**Discussion:**
This question relates to breast milk jaundice, a topic also asked in previous [[INICET 2025 preparation strategies | INICET exams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Breast milk jaundice is typically a late-onset jaundice, usually appearing beyond 3 to 4 weeks after birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Proposed theories for breast milk jaundice:**
    1.  **High free fatty acid concentration:** This is thought to inhibit the conjugation of bilirubin, leading to increased unconjugated bilirubin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    2.  **Presence of beta-glucuronidase activity:** This enzyme deconjugates bilirubin, converting conjugated bilirubin back into unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Both mechanisms result in increased unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Breast milk jaundice is a benign condition, and breastfeeding should generally not be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

**Answer:** C. Conjugation of bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>

## Question 3: Metabolic State of Marasmus

**Question:** Which of the following describes the metabolic state of marasmus?
A. Edema due to severe protein deficiency
B. Severe calorie deficit with normal serum protein
C. Increased insulin levels with reduced lipolysis
D. Positive nitrogen balance and low cortisol level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>

**Discussion:**
Marasmus is a standard topic in pediatrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Marasmus is characterized by **severe calorie deficit with normal serum protein** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Option A (Edema due to severe protein deficiency) describes **Kwashiorkor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Option C (Increased insulin level and reduced lipolysis) is incorrect: in marasmus, insulin levels *decrease* due to chronic starvation, and lipolysis *increases* as the body mobilizes fat stores for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Option D (Positive nitrogen balance and low cortisol level) is incorrect: in marasmus, there's muscle protein breakdown for energy, leading to nitrogen excretion and a *negative nitrogen balance*. Chronic stress also leads to *increased* cortisol levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

**Answer:** B. Severe calorie deficit with normal serum protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>

## Question 4: Developmental Milestone - Sitting Without Support

**Case:** A 9-month-old child is unable to sit with support but can roll over from side to side. The child can say "mama" and "dada" and exhibits stranger anxiety.
**Question:** What is the appropriate next step in the management?
A. Reassure because it's a normal developmental variant.
B. Immediately refer for the assessment of development.
C. Perform cranial MRI.
D. Start physical therapy to help the child to sit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

**Discussion:**
*   **Milestone analysis for a 9-month-old:**
    *   Rolling over: Achieved by 4 months, so normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   Bisyllabic words ("mama," "dada"): Achieved by 9 months, so normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   Stranger anxiety: Achieved by 6 months, so normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Sitting without support: Usually attained by 8 months of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, it is considered delayed only if not attained by **10 months of age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   Since the child is 9 months old and sitting without support is only considered delayed after 10 months, this is within the normal developmental range.

**Answer:** A. Reassure because it's a normal developmental variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Question 5: Signs of Proper Breastfeeding Attachment (Latching)

**Case:** A 4-day-old neonate is being breastfed.
**Question:** Which of the following shows proper attachment?
A. Cheeks and mouth are full.
B. Lower areola more visible than the upper areola.
C. Chin touches the mother's breast.
D. Lower lip is inverted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>

**Discussion:**
Signs of good breastfeeding attachment (latching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:
*   Mouth wide open; cheeks and mouth are full with milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. (Option A is correct)
*   Chin touches the mother's breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. (Option C is correct)
*   Lips should be **everted** (turned outwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. (Option D states "inverted" and is incorrect)
*   Not only the nipple but also the areola should be inside the baby's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The **upper part of the areola may be visible**, but the lower areola should always be inside the baby's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. (Option B states "Lower areola more visible than the upper areola" and is incorrect)

**Answer:** A and C are correct statements. The provided solution combines them into one option, likely B, representing a selection of correct options. This context suggests a multiple-correct options question where A and C were the true options.

## Question 6: Neonatal Respiratory Distress with Chest X-ray

**Case:** A 4-day-old neonate born at 36 weeks gestation presents with respiratory distress, requiring 30% FiO2 to maintain SPO2. The baby is otherwise normal. Chest X-ray shows diffuse white markings from the perihilar region.
**Question:** What is the diagnosis?
A. Transient tachypnea of newborn
B. Respiratory distress syndrome
C. Meconium aspiration syndrome
D. Pneumonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>

**Discussion:**
*   **Chest X-ray findings:** Diffuse white markings, especially from the perihilar region, resembling a "sunburst appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. These represent fluid in the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Transient Tachypnea of Newborn (TTNB):** A benign condition caused by delayed clearance of lung fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
    *   Risk factors include term babies delivered by C-section, twin gestation, precipitous delivery, maternal diabetes/hypertension, and **late prematurity (35-36 weeks gestation)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The case's 36-week gestation fits "late prematurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
    *   Characterized by early onset tachypnea, sometimes retractions/grunting, relieved by **minimal O2 requirements (<40% FiO2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The case's 30% FiO2 fits this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):** Usually seen in babies ≤ 34 weeks gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. X-ray shows a "full white out appearance" of the lung, not just streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This is unlikely given the 36-week gestation and X-ray pattern.

**Answer:** A. Transient tachypnea of newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>

## Question 7: Vomiting in an Infant - Differential Diagnosis

**Case:** A 6-week-old baby presents with failure to thrive and poor feeding. Non-bilious, forceful but not projectile vomiting started 3 weeks after birth. Bowel movements are normal. Per abdominal examination has no significant findings.
**Question:** What is the most probable cause?
A. Cow milk protein allergy
B. GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease)
C. Intestinal obstruction
D. Pyloric stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>

**Discussion:**
*   **Intestinal Obstruction:** Unlikely. Usually presents with bilious vomiting, decreased or absent bowel movements, and abdominal distension, none of which are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Cow Milk Protein Allergy:** Unlikely. Typically associated with bloody stools, excessive irritability, eczema, or family history of allergies, which are not mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Pyloric Stenosis:** Resembles the presentation with late-onset (3 weeks after birth), non-bilious, and forceful vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. However, a key finding in pyloric stenosis is an **epigastric, olive-shaped mass** on abdominal examination, which is explicitly stated as absent ("no significant findings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **GERD:** When a presentation resembles pyloric stenosis but lacks the abdominal mass, GERD becomes the most likely diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

**Answer:** B. GERD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>

## Question 8: Lupus Nephritis Induction Therapy

**Case:** A 4-year-old female with SLE presents with proteinuria and rising creatinine values. Renal biopsy shows typical wire loop lesion.
**Question:** What is the most appropriate induction therapy?
A. Rituximab
B. IV cyclophosphamide with steroid
C. Mycophenolate mofetil only
D. High-dose steroid only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>

**Discussion:**
*   The case describes **Lupus Nephritis**, specifically Class IV (diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis), indicated by the "wire loop lesion," which is a severe form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   For severe lupus nephritis, corticosteroid therapy alone is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Treatment phases:**
    *   **Induction Phase:** Aims to induce remission. The standard therapy for severe forms (like Class IV) is monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide given for six consecutive months, **along with steroids** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
    *   **Maintenance Phase:** Follows induction to prevent relapse. Options include cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil; the latter is considered a better choice currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   Option C (Mycophenolate mofetil only) is used for maintenance, not induction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   Option D (High-dose steroid only) is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   Option A (Rituximab) is an alternative considered if the patient doesn't respond to cyclophosphamide and steroids, not as a first-line induction therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

**Answer:** B. IV cyclophosphamide with steroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>

## Question 9: Contraindicated Vaccine in SKID

**Question:** Which vaccine is contraindicated in a child with SKID?
A. Hepatitis B vaccine
B. Inactivated polio vaccine
C. DTAP
D. MMR vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>

**Discussion:**
*   SKID stands for **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, a severe form of primary immunodeficiency affecting both T and B cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
*   In severe immunodeficiencies, **live vaccines are strictly contraindicated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This is because the vaccine strain itself can undergo uncontrolled proliferation in an immunocompromised child, leading to serious, life-threatening infections like pneumonia or meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Vaccine types:**
    *   Hepatitis B vaccine and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) are **killed vaccines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
    *   DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis) is a **subunit vaccine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
    *   These killed and subunit vaccines can generally be given safely, though the immune response may not be fully effective in a child with SKID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
    *   MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) is a **live attenuated vaccine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

**Answer:** D. MMR vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>

## Question 10: Unusual Diagnosis for Leg Pain and Walking Difficulty

**Case:** A 2-year-old child presents with leg pain, difficulty in walking, and easy fatigability.
**Question:** What is the unusual diagnosis for this child?
A. Ewing sarcoma
B. Metastatic renal clear cell sarcoma
C. Metastatic neuroblastoma
D. Metastatic retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>

**Discussion:**
The question asks for the *unusual* diagnosis. Leg pain and difficulty walking suggest bone involvement; easy fatigability suggests anemia.
*   **Ewing Sarcoma:** A primary bone tumor. While classically seen in the second decade, it can occur in young children and presents with bone pain and walking difficulty, often associated with anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. This is a possible diagnosis.
*   **Metastatic Neuroblastoma:** Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. It commonly metastasizes to bone and bone marrow, leading to presentations like anemia and bone pain with walking difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. This is a very possible diagnosis.
*   **Metastatic Renal Clear Cell Sarcoma:** Nelson textbook indicates that once clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is diagnosed, a bone scan is performed due to a relatively higher chance of bone metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Thus, bone presentation is likely.
*   **Metastatic Retinoblastoma:** Retinoblastoma can spread to bone marrow and lungs via hematogenous or lymphatic spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. However, Nelson textbook specifically states that metastatic disease is **rarely present** in retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Routine bone scans are not required unless indicated by clinical findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Comparing renal clear cell sarcoma and retinoblastoma, bone metastasis is explicitly described as "rarely present" for retinoblastoma, making it the most unusual of the given options.

**Answer:** D. Metastatic retinoblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>

## Question 11: Neurological Symptoms in a 4-year-old

**Case:** A 4-year-old child presents with difficulty walking, a broad-based gait, and inability to perform heel-to-toe walking. The child was clinging to his mother (anxious). On examination, the child is hyperreflexic, and the Babinski sign is positive.
**Question:** What could be the probable diagnosis?
A. Guillain-Barré Syndrome
B. Cerebral Palsy
C. ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis)
D. Spinal cord lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>

**Discussion:**
This is an analytical question based on neurological signs.
*   **Spinal Cord Lesion:** Unlikely. While it can cause walking difficulties, the description doesn't fit perfectly. Hyperreflexia and Babinski sign are not always present or uniformly diagnostic without additional clues like sensory deficits or bowel/bladder involvement, which are not given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis):** Unlikely. The name "encephalomyelitis" suggests encephalopathy, which would include mental status changes or seizures, not mentioned in the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. The presentation doesn't sound acutely triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS):** Unlikely. GBS is a cause of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Key features of GBS are **areflexia** (absence of reflexes) and **ascending paralysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. The case describes **hyperreflexia** and doesn't mention ascending paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Cerebral Palsy (CP):** Most probable. CP often presents with spasticity, leading to difficulties in walking, a broad-based gait, and inability to perform heel-to-toe walking (all manifestations of lower limb spasticity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The presence of **hyperreflexia** and a **positive Babinski sign** are classic signs of upper motor neuron involvement, consistent with spastic CP, possibly diplegia type where both lower limbs are affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

**Answer:** B. Cerebral Palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>

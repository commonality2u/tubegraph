This article discusses the characteristics and symptoms of glucagonoma and somatostatinoma, two types of [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors]] (PNETs), often observed in patients with unusual presentations of diabetes and other systemic symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Glucagonoma

Glucagonoma is a type of [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] that is more likely to cause significant symptoms compared to some other PNETs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Location and Characteristics
*   **Origin**: Glucagonomas primarily arise from the body and tail of the pancreas, where alpha cells are dispersed, with a slightly higher prevalence in the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Lesion Size**: They are typically solitary, large lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Metastasis**: By the time glucagonomas are diagnosed, they have often already metastasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Clinical Manifestations: The 5Ds
Glucagonoma is classically associated with the "5Ds," which are a combination of key symptoms and findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:
1.  **Diabetes Mellitus**: This is often a rapidly worsening and [[presentation_and_diagnosis_of_secondary_diabetes_causes | uncontrolled diabetes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, distinct from typical Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: Patients are prone to thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
3.  **Depression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
4.  **Diarrhea** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
5.  **Dermatitis**: The most significant skin lesion is necrolytic migratory erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Glucagonoma Triad
A classic triad for glucagonoma includes necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, and abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Diarrhea and abdominal pain are often linked to excess glucagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Other Key Symptoms and Findings
*   **Weight Loss**: A prominent feature due to the utilization of amino acids to form glucose, leading to hypoaminoacidemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Hypoaminoacidemia**: This results in patients appearing frail with reduced muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Zinc Deficiency**: Features like cheilitis, glossitis, and depression can be indicative of acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is caused by zinc deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This is likely due to hypoalbuminemia, as albumin carries zinc in circulation, and proteins are consumed for glucose production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Somatostatinoma

Somatostatinoma is another type of [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] with distinct features.

### Location and Triad
*   **Origin**: Somatostatinomas most commonly arise from the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Classic Triad**: The triad for somatostatinoma includes:
    1.  Diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
    2.  Cholelithiasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
    3.  Steatorrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

### Diabetes Severity
Unlike glucagonoma, somatostatinoma typically produces only mild diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This is because somatostatin inhibits glucagon, preventing a severe form of diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Associated Syndromes
*   **Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)**: Somatostatinomas are often associated with Neurofibromatosis 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Distinguishing Features
*   Somatostatinomas do not cause skin lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## General Considerations for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
When screening for secondary causes of diabetes, [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | neuroendocrine tumors]] (NETs) are an important consideration alongside conditions like hemochromatosis, IgG4-related disease, and pancreatic cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Diagnosis
For almost all [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors]], somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is the investigation of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. However, insulinomas and small gastrinomas (especially those associated with [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN1]]) are better detected by endoscopic ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Associated Syndromes
Pancreatic [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | neuroendocrine tumors]] can be associated with several genetic syndromes, including:
*   [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN1]] (due to *MEN1* gene mutation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>
*   [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN4]] (due to *CDKN1B* gene mutation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>
*   Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Tuberous Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>

### [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | Carcinoid Syndrome]]
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (midgut carcinoids) release effectors like histamine and serotonin into the portal circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. These are typically cleared by the liver, so [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] (flushing, bronchospasm, diarrhea) only manifests if there is hepatic metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The most important complication of [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] is right-sided cardiac involvement, leading to right-sided heart failure and commonly tricuspid valve vegetation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Patients may also experience niacin deficiency because tryptophan is diverted to serotonin formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

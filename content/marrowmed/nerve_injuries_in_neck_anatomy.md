Nerve injuries in the neck can lead to a variety of clinical presentations, affecting motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. Understanding the [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | anatomical]] course and distribution of these nerves is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.

## Frey's Syndrome
Frey's Syndrome is a clear case of [[freys_syndrome_and_nerve_injury | nerve injury]] that occurs after parotid surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Patients present with flushing, sweating, and a burning sensation on the affected side of the face during meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
The commonly involved nerve in parotid surgery leading to Frey's Syndrome is the auriculotemporal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This nerve is a secretomotor nerve to the parotid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
During regeneration after injury, the auriculotemporal nerve most commonly fuses with the [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | great auricular nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The great auricular nerve supplies the skin over the parotid region and its sweat glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Less commonly, it can fuse with the buccal nerve or the lesser occipital nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the posterior division of the mandibular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Ansa Cervicalis Injury
The ansa cervicalis is a nerve loop that supplies the strap muscles of the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. It is formed by branches from the hypoglossal nerve and C2/C3 cervical spinal nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
The strap muscles are the midline muscles of the neck located below the hyoid bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. These include the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and omohyoid muscles (superior and inferior bellies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
**Exception:** The only strap muscle *not* supplied by the ansa cervicalis is the thyrohyoid muscle, which is directly supplied by the C1 spinal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Spinal Accessory Nerve Injury
Injury to the spinal accessory nerve can cause winging of the scapula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Other nerves that can cause winging of the scapula include the long thoracic nerve (supplying serratus anterior) and the dorsal scapular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
The spinal accessory nerve is a major content of the posterior triangle of the neck and is superficially placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

### Location of Injury and Clinical Implications:
*   **Injury in the posterior triangle:** If the spinal accessory nerve is injured in the posterior triangle, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is spared because it has already been supplied by the nerve before it enters this triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Only the trapezius muscle will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   Symptoms include difficulty in:
        *   Combing hair (requires overhead abduction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>
        *   Shrugging shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
        *   Retraction of the scapula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>
        *   Overhead abduction (assisted by trapezius and serratus anterior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>
    *   Head turning to the opposite side (sternocleidomastoid function) will be normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Injury in the anterior (carotid) triangle:** If the nerve is injured before reaching the posterior triangle, both the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This will lead to more widespread difficulties, including impaired head turning and tilting, in addition to trapezius deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## Phrenic Nerve Injury
The phrenic nerve is visible running in front of the scalenus anterior muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Root Value:** C3, C4, and C5, with C4 being the major root value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Formation:** It is formed on the lateral border of the scalenus anterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Course:** The right phrenic nerve is shorter and more vertical, passing through the caval opening of the diaphragm along with the inferior vena cava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. The left phrenic nerve is longer and runs obliquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Function:** The phrenic nerve is a **mixed nerve** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
    *   **Motor:** Supplies the diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
    *   **Sensory:** Supplies the diaphragmatic peritoneum, fibrous pericardium, and mediastinal pleura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

## Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury
The recurrent laryngeal nerve is located in the tracheoesophageal groove, medial to the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
*   **Function:** It supplies all laryngeal muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Exception:** The cricothyroid muscle is the *only* laryngeal muscle supplied by the external laryngeal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Therefore, injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve will affect muscles like the posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, transverse arytenoid, and aryepiglotticus, but *not* the cricothyroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## Lingual Nerve Injury
The lingual nerve carries general sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. It is also topographically connected to the submandibular ganglion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The lingual nerve loops around the submandibular (Wharton's) duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Therefore, during incision in the floor of the mouth to remove a stone from the submandibular duct, the lingual nerve is in danger of injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. The hypoglossal nerve, while supplying tongue muscles, is not as closely related to the duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

## Facial Nerve Branches and [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | Implications of Surgery]]
The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland and divides into five terminal branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. Parotid surgery carries a risk of injury to these branches.
*   **Temporal branch:** Supplies the frontalis muscle and upper part of orbicularis oculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Injury leads to difficulty raising eyebrows or wrinkling the forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Zygomatic branch:** Mainly supplies the orbicularis oculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. Injury leads to difficulty closing the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
*   **Buccal branch:** Supplies the buccinator muscle and upper lip muscles (e.g., levator labii superioris, zygomaticus major/minor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. Injury leads to upper lip muscle weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Marginal mandibular branch:** Supplies the lower lip muscles (e.g., depressor anguli oris, depressor labii inferioris, mentalis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>. Injury leads to lower lip muscle weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
*   **Cervical branch:** Supplies the platysma muscle in the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

## Foramen Ovale Compression
Compression through a widened foramen ovale, typically seen in transcranial herniation, affects structures passing through this foramen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. The mnemonic "MALE" helps remember the contents:
*   **M**andibular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   **A**ccessory meningeal artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>
*   **L**esser petrosal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>
*   **E**missary veins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>

### Clinical Implications of Foramen Ovale Compression:
*   **Mandibular nerve injury:** Leads to weakness of muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. It also affects non-masticatory muscles: tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, mylohyoid, and the anterior belly of the digastric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
    *   Weakness of the oral diaphragm (mylohyoid muscle) would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
*   **Lesser petrosal nerve injury:** This nerve is a pre-ganglionic nerve to the otic ganglion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Its post-ganglionic fibers supply the parotid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. Injury would result in loss of secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
*   **Spared function:** Cutaneous innervation of the upper lip would be spared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. This area is supplied by the infraorbital nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. The maxillary nerve exits through the foramen rotundum, not the foramen ovale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

## Superior Orbital Fissure and Annulus of Zinn Compression
The superior orbital fissure is divided into three parts by the common tendinous ring, also known as the Annulus of Zinn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. Compression within the annulus of Zinn affects specific nerves passing through it.
*   **Nerves passing *above* the Annulus of Zinn (LFT):**
    *   Lacrimal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>
    *   Frontal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>
    *   Trochlear nerve (CN IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>
    *   Superior ophthalmic vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>
*   **Nerves passing *inside* the Annulus of Zinn:**
    *   Upper and lower divisions of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>
    *   Abducens nerve (CN VI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>
    *   Nasociliary nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>
*   **Nerves passing *below* the Annulus of Zinn:**
    *   Inferior ophthalmic vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>

### Clinical Implications of Annulus of Zinn Compression:
If there is compression of nerves inside the Annulus of Zinn, the oculomotor (CN III) and abducens (CN VI) nerves will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Spared Function:** The trochlear nerve (CN IV) will be spared because it passes *outside* the Annulus of Zinn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Therefore, the superior oblique muscle, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve, will maintain its motor function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

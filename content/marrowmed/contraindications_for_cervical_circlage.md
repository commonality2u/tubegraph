Several conditions serve as contraindications for applying [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical circlage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

The procedure should generally not be performed if:
*   The membranes are ruptured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   There is chorioamnionitis (infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   There is active bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   Uterine contractions are present, indicating the process of labor has started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While rescue or emergency [[Cervical Circlage Techniques and Indications | Worm's circlage]] can be attempted in such cases, the results are not as favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   The dilation of the cervix is greater than or equal to 3 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   There are gross congenital anomalies in the fetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   There is a current pelvic infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

A relative contraindication for [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cerclage]] is placenta previa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

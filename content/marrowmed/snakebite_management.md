Snakebite is a frequently encountered medical emergency, and understanding its management is crucial for medical professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Questions related to snakebite management are commonly featured in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Types of Snake Venom and Their Effects

Snake venom is primarily composed of various enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>, such as neurolysin, fibrolysin, cardiotoxins, cholinesterase, L-amino acid oxidase, and hyaluronidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. While most enzymes are present in almost all snake venoms, the predominant effect (neurotoxic, hemotoxic, or myotoxic) depends on the concentration of specific enzymes in that particular venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

Three important families of snakes are:
*   **Elapids** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>
    *   **Examples:** King cobra, common cobra, krait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Venom Type:** Predominantly neurotoxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Symptoms:** Patients typically present with neuromuscular paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This paralysis is descending, often starting in the face with symptoms like drooping eyelids and loss of forehead furrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Eventually, patients may develop respiratory failure, which can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Occult Bite:** Krait bites are commonly associated with occult bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Viperids** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>
    *   **Examples:** Russell's viper, saw-scaled viper, pit viper, hump-nosed viper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Venom Type:** Hemotoxic or vasculotoxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Symptoms:** Patients may present with complications like Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), shock, bleeding tendencies, spontaneous bleeding, and renal failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Viper bites are also associated with more extensive local necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Hydrophids (Sea Snakes)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>
    *   **Example:** Sea snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Venom Type:** Myotoxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Symptoms:** Muscle pain, tenderness, swelling, necrosis, and renal failure due to muscle necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Tall T waves in ECG can be seen with sea snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis
*   **20-Minutes Whole Blood Clotting Test:** This test is mainly performed for viper bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## First Aid Management

The "RAGHTT" mnemonic can be used for first aid management of snakebites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>:
*   **R**eassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>
*   **I**mmobilization: Immobilize the affected limb similar to a [[fracture_management_strategies | fractured limb]] or [[basics_of_fracture_management | fractured limb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Pressure Immobilization:** Apply a creep bandage to put pressure on the limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The purpose of this pressure is to occlude lymphatics, as venom spreads through the lymphatic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **G**et to hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>
*   **H**ospital
*   **T**ell the symptoms to the doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>

## Specific Treatment

*   **Polyvalent Anti-Snake Venom (ASV):**
    *   This is the only specific management available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
    *   ASV is prepared from hyperimmunized horse serum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Dose:** 10 vials intravenously (IV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Administration:** ASV should only be given if the patient shows signs of envenomation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. If no signs, only observation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Precautions:** Patients can experience allergic symptoms or anaphylaxis, so close observation is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   **Neostigmine with Atropine:**
    *   This combination can be given for elapid (specifically cobra) bites to reverse neuroparalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Importance of Observation
> It is crucial to monitor the patient for signs of envenomation before administering anti-snake venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## Clinical Features of Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism presents with characteristic features, often summarized as "bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychiatric overtones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Among these, recurrent renal stones are the most common manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. A clinical scenario often involves a patient presenting with symptoms like recurrent urinary stones and a pathological fracture, accompanied by elevated calcium and PTH levels in blood reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Parathyroid Gland Localization
For the management of hyperparathyroidism, accurately localizing the parathyroid gland is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The preferred imaging modality for this purpose is a system EB scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Specifically, a SPEC (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) system EB scan is considered the most effective for localizing the lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This question has been previously featured in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Intraoperative Assessment: Miami Criteria
The [[primary_hyperparathyroidism_and_surgery_criteria | Miami criteria]] are utilized to confirm the successful removal of the affected parathyroid gland during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. This protocol involves measuring parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels before the surgical procedure and again 10 to 15 minutes after the suspected diseased gland has been excised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. A reduction in PTH value by more than 50% indicates that the correct gland has been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. The half-life of parathyroid hormone is approximately 7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

In Anatomy exams, questions regarding [[general_embryology | embryology]], specifically about neural crest derivatives, have appeared in both theoretical and image-based formats. For example, a theory question was asked in November 2024, while an image-based question was presented in 2023, requiring identification of derivatives from an electron microscope image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Derivatives and Mnemonic

A mnemonic, "MORTEL PASS," is used to remember the derivatives of the neural crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:

*   **M** - Melanocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   **O** - Odontoblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   **T** - Tracheal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, stromal cells, or adrenal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **P** - Parafollicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, Pseudounipolar cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   **A** - All ganglions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> (including the adrenal medulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **S** - Schwann cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **S** - Spiral membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

Additional derivatives mentioned include ciliary muscles and ciliary body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Non-Derivatives

It is important to distinguish neural crest derivatives from other embryological origins. For example, the retina is **not** derived from neural crest cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Instead, the retina and optic nerve are continuations or extensions of the diencephalon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, which originates from the neural tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The neural tube itself develops from neuroectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Therefore, the retinal pigment epithelium is also not a neural crest derivative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

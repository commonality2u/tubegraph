Drug withdrawal refers to the set of physical and mental symptoms that occur after reducing or stopping a substance that has been chronically used. Management strategies vary depending on the substance and the severity of withdrawal.

## Alcohol Withdrawal
Severe cases of alcohol withdrawal should be treated with benzodiazepines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Administering [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | Flumazenil]], an antidote to benzodiazepines, in alcohol withdrawal can worsen the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

## Opioid Withdrawal
[[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | Opioid withdrawal]] is rarely fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. In contrast, [[opioid_poisoning_and_its_treatment | opioid poisoning]] can be extremely fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. The triad of [[opioid_poisoning_and_its_treatment | opioid poisoning]] includes:
*   Comatose or unconscious state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   Respiratory depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>
*   Pinpoint pupils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>

Chronic [[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | opioid withdrawal]] can be treated with long-acting drugs such as buprenorphine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of mu receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>, which helps manage craving and withdrawal symptoms while blocking mu receptors to prevent the "high" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. It is useful in managing both [[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | opioid withdrawal]] and [[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | opioid addiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

## Cannabis Withdrawal
[[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | Cannabis withdrawal]] is associated with minimal physical symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. For a long time, it was believed that cannabis only caused psychological dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. While cannabis can cause physical symptoms, they are generally less intense and less frequent compared to withdrawal from other substances like cocaine or alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Related Drug Effects and Toxicity

### Bupropion
Bupropion is a dual antidepressant that increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. It is known to cause the least sexual side effects and least weight gain among antidepressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. However, bupropion can decrease the seizure threshold, requiring caution in patients with a history of seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Bupropion is also used for [[pharmacological_management_of_nicotine_addiction | nicotine addiction]].

### Ketamine
[[etomidate_and_its_effects | Ketamine]] is a psychoactive and anesthetic agent that is useful in [[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | treatment resistant depression]] and for patients with suicidal ideation, providing a rapid antidepressant effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Its onset of action can be within a few hours of intravenous (IV) administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. In psychiatry, a sub-anesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg is used, given as an IV infusion over 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Cannabidiol (CBD)
Cannabidiol is primarily approved by the FDA for resistant seizures, particularly in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. It has also been used in:
*   Chronic pain management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>
*   Neuromuscular spasms and movement disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>
*   Cachexia (e.g., HIV-related, cancer-related, chemotherapy-related) to improve appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>
Cannabidiol is not known to be addictive and has minimal or negligible abuse potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Mephedrone
Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant drug derived from cathinones (also known as "bath salts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It is similar to amphetamines or MDMA, with a high abuse potential and hallucinogenic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Patients using mephedrone may present with violent and aggressive behaviors in emergency rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### Volatile Inhalants
Volatile inhalants are toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. They can cause [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | neurotoxicity]], [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | cardiotoxicity]], [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | hepatotoxicity]], and [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | renal toxicity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Repeated use can lead to neurotoxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

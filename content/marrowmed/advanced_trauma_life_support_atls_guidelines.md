[[advice_for_specific_medical_subjects_and_exams | Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)]] guidelines are a structured approach for the immediate management of trauma patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. These guidelines are crucial for identifying and addressing life-threatening injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

## Primary Survey

The primary survey in ATLS focuses on identifying and managing life-threatening injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. It follows a sequential order, typically remembered by the mnemonic ABCDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>:
*   **A**irway with cervical spine protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>
*   **B**reathing and ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>
*   **C**irculation with hemorrhage control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>
*   **D**isability (neurologic status) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>
*   **E**xposure and environmental control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>

While in real clinical settings, multiple medical personnel may perform these steps simultaneously, for examination purposes, the sequential order of A, B, C, D must be followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.

### Airway Management
Indications for establishing a definitive airway include:
*   Inability to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>
*   Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>
*   Comatose patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>
*   Severe maxillofacial injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>

The preferred method to achieve an airway is orotracheal intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>. If orotracheal intubation fails, emergency airways like needle cricothyroidotomy can be used for 20-30 minutes, providing time to perform a definitive tracheostomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>.

### Breathing Management
For patients with absent breath sounds, such as those with pneumothorax or hemothorax, an intercostal tube should be inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:30]</a>. Oxygen administration is also a part of breathing management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>.

### Circulation Management
Securing intravenous (IV) access is a critical step in circulation management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:30">[02:01:30]</a>.

## Secondary Survey

The secondary survey is a more detailed assessment, performed after the primary survey, to identify all other injuries that are not immediately life-threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>.

## Adjuncts to Primary Survey

Adjuncts are diagnostic tools used to supplement the primary survey. These include:
*   **X-ray Chest:** An AP view is typically performed, as the patient is often supine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:30">[02:49:30]</a>.
*   **FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma):** This ultrasound helps detect fluid (blood) in the abdomen or pericardium, assisting in the assessment of breathing and circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:30">[02:05:30]</a>.
*   **X-ray Pelvis:** An AP view is used to identify pelvic fractures, which can be a source of concealed bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:30">[02:19:30]</a>.
*   **Pulse Oximetry:** Used to monitor oxygen saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:30">[02:35:30]</a>.
*   **Cervical Spine Imaging:** X-rays of the cervical spine can also be an adjunct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:30">[02:47:30]</a>.

**Computed Tomography (CT) scans** are **not** considered an adjunct to the primary survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. CT scans are performed only when the patient is stable, as they are time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:30">[02:56:30]</a>.

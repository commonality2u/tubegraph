Celiac disease, also known as gluten hypersensitivity, is a condition that responds to a gluten-free diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Celiac disease can be suspected based on various abdominal symptoms in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>:
*   Lack of weight gain or failure to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>
*   Abdominal pain on eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>
*   Poor eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>
*   Chronic diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>

A significant clue for diagnosis is improvement in general condition and weight gain after a child is advised a gluten-free diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>.

## Diagnostic Approach
To make a definitive diagnosis of celiac disease, [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | investigations]] are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>.

### Initial Testing
Initial [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody testing]] is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>. This involves estimating IgA levels along with anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23">[05:23]</a>.

### Confirmatory Methods
If antibody levels are elevated (positive), the diagnosis should be confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>. This can be done with further [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody testing]] for anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>, or by performing a biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>. A definite response to a gluten-free diet also helps confirm the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.

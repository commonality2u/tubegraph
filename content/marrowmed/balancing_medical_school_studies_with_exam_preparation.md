Yashaswi, the highest scorer in this year's FMG exam with 257 out of 300, pursued his MBBS in Russia for six years before returning to India for his exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. His journey highlights a strategic approach to [[balancing_medical_study_with_university_life | balancing medical studies with exam preparation]], first during his university years and then during dedicated study for the FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Integrating Exam Preparation During MBBS

Yashaswi's preparation for the FMG exam began gradually during his MBBS years, rather than as an immediate, focused goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Early Adoption of Marrow

He started using Marrow after finishing his fourth year of MBBS, around 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. His strategy involved:
*   **Self-Paced Learning** He watched all the main videos at his "own pace," without rushing, allowing him to build concepts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Immediate QBank Practice** After completing a topic's videos, he would immediately solve the corresponding QBank questions. This approach helped "trigger more signups" in his brain, reinforcing concepts and highlighting important areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. He primarily used the NEET PG QBank, aiming for a high score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits for College Exams** Utilizing Marrow's content during his college days also proved beneficial for his university exams, as many college exam questions mirrored the concepts covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. He recommends that FMG students try to finish all main videos while still in college to aid their college exams and then focus more on questions upon returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
*   **Transition to Rapid Revision** In his final year of MBBS, he started watching rapid revision videos, which helped to "concise all the material" he had studied over the previous two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Dedicated FMG Exam Preparation

After returning to India, Yashaswi entered a phase of intensive, dedicated preparation for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Revision Strategy and Tools
His revision strategy focused on:
*   **Revision Notes** He had watched rapid revision videos prior to coming back, but upon returning, he got the notes printed and focused on reading them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent QBank Practice** He solved more than 85% of the QBank during college and used the "Clean Slate" feature to re-solve them after returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Daily, he aimed to solve over 100 questions using custom modules for PYQs, incorrect questions, and a mixed bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. He emphasized that for an MCQ exam, solving MCQs daily alongside theory is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTS)** He began giving GTS sincerely in the last two years, including all live GTS from the past year. He completed more than 40 to 50 GTS, along with subject and mini-tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. His scores gradually improved, consistently staying above 200 in the last six months of FMG GTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Reviewing GTS** He primarily reviewed only his incorrect answers by creating custom modules from them, aiming to turn "incorrects into corrects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   **Pearls** He used Pearls for confusing topics and minor subjects, finding the images, tables, and charts very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Revisions** His goal was to complete four to five full revisions, which he succeeded in achieving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

### Addressing Weak Subjects
Yashaswi identified Pathology as his strongest subject and Physiology as a weaker one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. His strategy for weak subjects involved:
*   Focusing on important topics recommended by faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
*   Ceasing focus on stronger subjects to dedicate more time to "revising multiple times the weaker subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.

### Exam Day Approach
For the FMG exam, which was noted for being tricky and lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, Yashaswi emphasized:
*   **Conceptual Understanding** While rapid revision videos are helpful, he noted that they "might not suffice for the trickier questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. A deep understanding from main videos is necessary for a score above 200, especially for major subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.
*   **Focused Reading** His advice was to "read the question, focus on important line that examiner is giving" to identify the correct answer even in tricky scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

Beyond academics, Yashaswi's parents highlighted his highly disciplined routine, which allowed for [[balancing_academics_and_personal_life_in_medicine | balancing academics and personal life in medicine]].
*   **Adequate Sleep** He prioritized sleep, getting 7-8 hours nightly, which is crucial for retaining concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. He believed in not compromising on sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   **Focused Study Time** He maintained a timer during study sessions to ensure focused work during his dedicated study hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Manifestation and Goal Setting** From the moment he returned from Russia, Yashaswi set an explicit goal to score 300 in the FMG exam, even creating a visual manifestation (a photograph of a previous topper with his own goal changed) to keep his motivation high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This positive thinking and clear goal-setting played a significant role in his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

Yashaswi's journey exemplifies that there is "no difference between the examinations" and that consistent hard work, self-discipline, and a balanced approach to [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] will lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>.

Bullous disorders are a category of dermatological conditions characterized by blistering of the skin.

## Associated Conditions and Symptoms

*   **Itchy, Blistering Skin Issues with GI Complaints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>
    *   When a [[celiac_sprue | GI disorder]] is involved with bullous disease, [[celiac_sprue | Celiac Sprue]] (also known as [[celiac_sprue | Gluten Sensitive Enteropathy]]) is an important association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.
    *   [[celiac_sprue | Gluten Sensitive Enteropathy]] can be associated with dermatitis herpetiformis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.
    *   **Antibodies**: In this context, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are looked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>.

## Pemphigus Vulgaris

Pemphigus Vulgaris is a bullous disorder that can present with skin lesions and vesicular eruptions in the buccal mucosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.

### Diagnosis

*   **Pathology**: The pathology in pemphigus is intraepidermal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>.
*   **Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF)**:
    *   DIF reveals intraepidermal deposition in a characteristic fishnet pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>.
    *   Specific antibodies deposited are IgG and C3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:24">[03:23:24]</a>.
    *   The site of deposition is intraepidermal intercellular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis (for blistering disorders)

*   Dermatitis herpetiformis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>
*   Bullous pemphigoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>
*   Linear IgA disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>

### Immunofluorescence (IF) Technique

Immunofluorescence is a technique used to visualize antigen-antibody complexes under a UV microscope, using fluorine-tagged antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.

*   **Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF)**:
    *   A single-step procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.
    *   Examines antibodies already bound *in vivo* to antigens in the skin or mucosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:21">[02:23:21]</a>.
    *   **Biopsy Site**: For autoimmune blistering diseases, the biopsy should typically be taken from the perilesional normal skin, as antigen-antibody complexes in lesional skin are often consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.
    *   In subepidermal blistering disorders (like dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA disease), DIF findings are typically seen along the basement membrane zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.

*   **Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF)**:
    *   A two-step procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.
    *   Looks for circulating autoantibodies in the patient's serum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:57">[02:55:57]</a>.
    *   **Utility**: Helps correlate disease severity (e.g., titer levels), predicts prognosis, and monitors therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

## Lumbrical Muscles

Lumbricals are muscles associated with the fingers, not the thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Specifically, there are four lumbricals for the four fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. When traced, any lumbrical will reach its respective digit from the lateral side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

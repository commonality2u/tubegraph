Diabetic retinopathy can lead to several significant complications affecting vision and eye health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Main Complications

Four primary complications of diabetic retinopathy include:
1.  Cystoid macular edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>
2.  Vitreous hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>
3.  [[Retinal layers and anatomy|Retinal detachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>
4.  Rubeosis iridis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

### Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)
Cystoid macular edema is the most common cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Vitreous Hemorrhage
Vitreous hemorrhage is the most common cause of vision loss in proliferative diabetic retinopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This bleeding occurs once neovascularization (proliferation of new blood vessels) is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Retinal Detachment
[[Retinal layers and anatomy|Retinal detachment]] is the most common cause of blindness associated with diabetic retinopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The most common type of [[Retinal layers and anatomy|retinal detachment]] that occurs in diabetic retinopathy is tractional [[Retinal layers and anatomy|retinal detachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Rubeosis Iridis
Rubeosis iridis refers to neovascularization of the iris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This condition can lead to neovascular glaucoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Characteristics of Vision Loss
Generally, vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is gradual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a> and painless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)
FFA is an investigation used to diagnose vascular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a> and macular disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. It involves injecting a fluorescein dye to visualize blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

In the context of diabetic retinopathy:
*   **Microaneurysms** appear as tiny hyperfluorescent dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Neovascularization** (new vessel growth) appears as hyperfluorescent branching structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, indicating a tuft of tortuous vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **Hypofluorescent (dark) areas** can indicate the presence of:
    *   Exudates (lipid deposits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>
    *   Cotton wool spots (deposits of neuronal debris) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>
    These deposits cover blood vessels, masking the fluorescein dye from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

A normal macula appears dark on FFA because it is avascular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. If the macula remains dark in an FFA, it indicates the macula is completely normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Abnormal macular appearance on FFA, such as a "flower petal" appearance in CME <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, or "ink blot" or "smoke stack" appearance with dye leakage in Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, suggests macular involvement.

The half-life of a drug (T½) is a key pharmacokinetic parameter, representing the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the body to be reduced by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This concept is frequently tested in medical examinations such as the [[pharmacology_mcqs_in_inicet_2025 | INICET]] and [[neetpg_2024_pharmacology_question_discussion | NEETPG]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Half-Life Calculation

The half-life of a drug can be calculated using the following formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:

`T½ = (0.693 * Volume of Distribution) / Clearance` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

For quicker calculations during exams, the constant 0.693 can be rounded off to 0.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Example: Digoxin Half-Life

Consider a numerical problem involving Digoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:

*   **Patient weight**: 46 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   **Volume of Distribution (VD)**: 6 L/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   **Clearance**: 4.6 L/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

To calculate the total volume of distribution for the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:
*   Total VD = Patient Weight × VD per kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Total VD = 46 kg × 6 L/kg = 276 L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Now, applying the half-life formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   T½ = (0.7 × 276 L) / 4.6 L/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   T½ ≈ 42 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

The calculated half-life for Digoxin in this scenario is approximately 42 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This type of direct numerical question is considered relatively easy if the formula is known and basic mathematics can be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Dr. Ravi, who secured Rank 3 in the INI CET exam and previously Rank 5 in NEET PG, shared his journey and how educational platforms like [[marrow_for_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] played a crucial role in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He emphasized that his success was an "accidental rank" due to a decision to attempt the INI CET exam on the last day of registration, with minimal dedicated study time leading up to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, his strong foundational knowledge and a no-pressure mindset, having already secured a good rank in NEET PG, contributed significantly to his unexpected achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Starting the Journey with [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]]

Dr. Ravi began his PG preparation from his third year of MBBS, opting for [[Use of Marrow for medical studies | Marrow]] Plan C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. His initial approach was to cover third-year subjects and a portion of final-year subjects using [[use_of_marrow_videos_for_medical_education | Marrow videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This strategy helped alleviate the burden of completing all nine subjects for PG preparation in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He aimed to complete all third and final-year syllabus videos by the end of his final year, anticipating insufficient time during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. For notes, he used a mixed approach, making some notes himself (e.g., surgery, medicine) and utilizing PDF notes for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## MCQ Practice and Strategy

Dr. Ravi primarily focused on MCQ practice during his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. At the start of his internship, he reset all previously completed modules on the [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]] app to begin solving them again from module one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. During this phase, he also incorporated first and second-year subjects for MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. By the end of his internship, he had completed approximately 80% of all MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

He noted a significant difference between solving MCQs during pre-final/final year versus internship:
*   **Pre-final/Final Year**: He could dedicate more time to reading explanations and noting down important points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Internship**: With limited time, he selectively read explanations, prioritizing revising from his notes if he answered an MCQ incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

To maintain consistency in MCQ practice during a demanding internship, he set a daily challenge to solve a minimum of four or five modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His approach involved reading a topic and then immediately solving the corresponding module on [[Utilizing educational resources like Marrow videos and Q Bank | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This method offered two benefits:
1.  **Comprehensive Review**: Solving MCQs provided a thorough review of the topic he had just read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
2.  **Retention**: It helped "hammer the topic in your brain," aiding retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Strategy and Analysis

Dr. Ravi started appearing for Grand Tests (GTs) in his first month of internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. His frequency varied from one GT every two to three weeks, depending on his internship postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

His GT analysis strategy involved using filters on the [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] app:
1.  **Incorrect Questions**: Reviewed first to identify conceptual gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Skipped Questions**: Analyzed to understand why they were difficult or unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
3.  **Guessed Correct Questions**: Reviewed to ensure he understood the full concept, not just lucky guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
He would only go through correct questions if time permitted, as he already understood their concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. He made sure to revise the GT material on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Overcoming Stagnated GT Scores

Dr. Ravi faced phases where his GT scores stagnated, first at around 150 correct answers, and later at 165 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. He realized that he had been postponing certain subjects, such as Community Medicine and Forensic Medicine & Toxicology (FMT), waiting for updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. To overcome this, he prioritized studying these weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He utilized [[Utilizing educational resources like Marrow videos and Q Bank | Marrow]]'s subject-wise review feature in the GT analysis to identify his weakest areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He then used the QBank's schema to focus on frequently asked topics within those subjects, which helped improve his scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## Revision Strategy and "20th Notebook"

For NEET PG, Dr. Ravi achieved three to four full revisions of the 19 subjects in the last three months, taking only 20-25 days for each complete revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. His key to quick revisions was planning from day one of his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

He created a dedicated "20th notebook" where he wrote down factual information or concepts he knew he would easily forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. He deliberately excluded common-sense information he already remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This meticulous approach allowed him to condense subjects significantly; for example, he could revise surgery in just 60 pages, taking 8 to 9 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This "20th notebook" served as a quick revision tool, especially in the week leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Leveraging [[Utilizing online resources like Marrow effectively | Marrow]] Pearls

[[Use and benefits of educational platforms like Marrow | Marrow]] Pearls were particularly helpful during Dr. Ravi's internship, especially during demanding 12-hour or 24-hour emergency room shifts or while in the ward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. He used them for quick subject revision, focusing on the important, highlighted points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. He described [[Use of Marrow for medical studies | Marrow]] Pearls as "life-saving" during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Appreciation for [[Role of digital tools and apps in medical education | Marrow]]'s User Interface

Dr. Ravi's favorite aspect of the [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]] app is its User Interface (UI), which he found to be simple yet highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. He appreciated the ease of accessing videos and Grand Tests within the app's layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. His message to the developers was to "keep it up" with the app's simplicity and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Future Aspirants

Dr. Ravi shared valuable advice for medical PG aspirants:
*   **Revision is Key**: Emphasizing that revision is the most critical factor in the final examination, especially since more than 80% of medicine is factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Plan Revision Early**: Students should plan their revision strategy from day one of their preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. It's impossible to revise all 19 subjects from main notes just a month before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Concise Notes**: Create your own concise notes or use pre-made notes that suit your learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests are Irreplaceable**: Regularly taking Grand Tests is crucial for proper preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Focus on Main Subjects First**: It's important to read the main subjects thoroughly before filtering information for revision, rather than directly jumping to revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

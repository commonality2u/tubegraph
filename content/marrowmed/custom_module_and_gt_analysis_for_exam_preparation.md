## Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand Tests (GTs) are crucial for exam readiness and should be started early in the preparation process, ideally as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. They are essential for preparing from the perspective of the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a> and developing the necessary exam skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>.

### Importance of Grand Tests

*   **Develops Exam Skills**: GTs provide the necessary practice to answer questions effectively under exam conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>, helping students overcome confusion between options and improve their ability to apply theoretical knowledge to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>.
*   **Overcomes Fear of Testing**: Regularly appearing for GTs helps eliminate the fear or "phobia" associated with tests and potentially low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. The focus should be on learning how to answer questions rather than worrying about the score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:27">[02:29:27]</a>.
*   **Strategy Fine-Tuning**: GTs allow students to experiment with different approaches, such as aggressive (attempting 180-190 questions) or conservative (marking only correct ones), to find what works best for them on the actual exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[02:31:16]</a>. This includes understanding one's own guessing game effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>.
*   **Assessment of Preparation**: GTs provide an objective assessment of preparation level and highlight areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:10">[02:51:10]</a>.

### Frequency of Grand Tests

Daily GTs are not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:17">[02:14:17]</a>. The ideal frequency is once a week, or a maximum of twice a week or twice in 10 days, depending on the stage of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:34">[02:13:34]</a>. This allows sufficient time for revision of notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a> and proper review of the GT itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:59">[02:52:59]</a>.

### Grand Test Schedule

Key Grand Tests and Mock Exams are available, including the National NEET PG Mock Exam and INI style GTs, and INI CET Mock Exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:10">[02:32:10]</a>. Mock exams are free and open to all, encouraging wider participation to create a more competitive environment for better self-assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:24">[02:32:24]</a>.

## Reviewing Grand Test Performance

Effective review of GTs is crucial and should not consume excessive time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>.

### Categorizing Questions for Review

Questions encountered in a GT can be categorized into three types for efficient review:
1.  **Questions answered correctly with sound reasoning**: No need to review these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>. Skip and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">[02:37:54]</a>.
2.  **Questions not known at all (factual or conceptual)**:
    *   **Factual, not previously asked, low success rate (15-20% correct)**: Read once and ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>.
    *   **Factual, majority got correct (60-70% correct), but you got wrong**: Bookmark and add to your notes for future review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>.
3.  **Conceptual questions or those answered correctly by chance/guessing**: Read the explanation and bookmark it, or add to notes for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:29">[02:42:29]</a>.

This focused approach helps complete the review process in 2 to 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:52">[02:42:52]</a>.

### Improving GT Scores Over Time

To improve GT scores, a balanced approach is needed:
*   **Address Weak Areas**: Utilize the GT analysis report (provided by Marrow) to identify subjects that consistently bring down your score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:10">[02:51:10]</a>. Revise these weak subjects or specific difficult topics within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>.
*   **Correct Thought Process**: The GT discussion videos address common errors in thought processes that lead to mistakes, even in taught concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:05">[02:31:05]</a>. Engaging with these videos can refine how you approach questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>.
*   **Refine Strategy**: Experiment with the number of questions to attempt, which ones to leave, and how to guess. The 'guess tracker' tool can help analyze guessing accuracy and refine your strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>.
*   **Balance Knowledge Maintenance and Addition**: Continuously revise information already learned (knowledge maintenance) and add new information from areas not yet covered or where mistakes are frequently made (knowledge addition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:12">[02:51:12]</a>. A stagnant score often means only maintaining existing knowledge without adding new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:48">[02:51:48]</a>.

## Custom Modules

Custom modules are a flexible tool for targeted practice and revision.

### New Update to Custom Modules

A recent update to custom modules allows students to simulate exam conditions more accurately:
*   If a 40-question custom module is chosen in exam mode, students will receive 42 minutes to solve it, mirroring the actual exam format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:43">[02:39:43]</a>.

### Recommended Tags for Custom Modules

The choice of tags depends on the student's preparation stage and target rank:
*   **Must-Do Tags**: Recent NEET, INI clinical questions, conceptual questions, recent updates, and image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:26">[02:39:26]</a>.
*   **Additional Tags (if time permits)**: Factual and number-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>.
*   **For Top Rankers (under 500/1000)**: All difficulty levels (hard, medium, easy) should be covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:56">[02:58:56]</a>.
*   **For Decent Rankers**: Focus on medium and easy difficulty questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>.
*   **High-Yield Specifics**: Investigation of choice, drug of choice, and common/recent updates are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:15">[02:59:15]</a>. For short subjects, eponymous terms are also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

### Strategy for Using Custom Modules

*   **Target Weak Areas**: Create custom modules for subjects or specific topics where you struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:20">[02:58:20]</a> (e.g., staging of cancers, specific instruments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:54">[02:57:54]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Questions**: Focus on questions you have bookmarked, especially those gotten wrong in GTs or frequently tested in recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:18">[02:58:18]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Custom modules offer the freedom to design questions based on individual preparation needs, such as focusing solely on instrument-based questions across all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>.

## Interplay with Overall Exam Strategy

### Integration with MCQ Discussion Videos

*   **For those using Revision Videos**: Watch the revision videos, then immediately proceed to the MCQ discussion videos to apply theory and get teacher inputs on thinking for the right answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **For those using Regular Videos and QBank**: Use the MCQ discussion videos as a subject-wise test curated by faculty. Attempt questions, and if correct with sound reasoning, skip explanations. If wrong or guessed, listen to the faculty's detailed explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>. This interactive format helps reinforce concepts and identify areas of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.
*   **GT Discussion Videos**: These are a subset of MCQ discussion videos, focusing on difficult questions from GTs 1-5 where a majority of students made errors. They provide reasoning for complex questions and help students understand why they are making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>.

### Time Management and Revision

*   **Daily MCQs**: Minimum of 100 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Allocate approximately 3.5 to 4 hours for 100 questions, including review of explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Notes vs. MCQs**: A time distribution of 50/50 or 60/40 between revising notes and doing MCQs is recommended at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Revision**: In the last 80 days, revision is the most important aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Dynamic "20th Notebook"**: Instead of creating a physical notebook, use WhatsApp or Telegram groups (one per subject) to quickly save screenshots or images of challenging concepts, difficult stagings, or frequently confused facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. Delete information once mastered to maintain a filtered collection of weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. This acts as a dynamic revision tool for the last few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.
*   **Limit New Information**: In the last 45 days before the exam, avoid adding new information to notes unless it's a previously asked question that was missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>. Information is infinite; focus on what has been historically tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:12">[02:55:12]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Maintain daily consistency in studying, even when unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>. This means continuing to study even when tired, bored, or facing distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:06">[03:32:06]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations**: Tailor your preparation strategy to your specific goals and avoid comparing yourself to other students, as their strategies may not be relevant to your needs or current progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:37">[03:47:37]</a>.

The investigation of choice for [[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | renal calculi]] (or ureteral calculi) is primarily a non-contrast CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Acute Renal Colic and Initial Investigation
Patients presenting with [[diagnosis_and_imaging_in_acute_renal_colic | acute renal colic]] often describe a clinical history of acute lumbar pain radiating from the loin to the groin, accompanied by burning and frequent micturition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

For initial assessment, an ultrasound (USG) is commonly performed in hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. An X-ray KUB (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder) is typically preferred only if ultrasound is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Ultrasound is considered the investigation of choice for detecting hydronephrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, as fluid is easily visualized by ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, ultrasound has limitations for direct visualization of calculi due to bowel gases, as air is an "enemy of ultrasound," which can obscure tiny ureteric calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Advanced Imaging for Renal Calculi
The most common type of [[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | renal calculi]] is calcium oxalate calculus, which is well visualized on CT scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

For determining the composition of calculi, a dual energy CT scan can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Radiolucent Calculi
Certain calculi are radiolucent and may not be seen on X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>:
*   Uric acid calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>
*   Indinavir calculi (medicine composition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>
*   Pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>

Among these, indinavir calculi and pure matrix calculi may also not be identified even on CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Radiological Signs and Appearances
### Staghorn Calculi
These are [[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | renal calculi]] that appear like the horn of a stag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. They are typically struvite calculi, composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, and often fill the pelvicalyceal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. They are commonly associated with urease-producing microbes such as *Proteus*, *Klebsiella*, or *Pseudomonas* infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Jackstone Vesical Calculi
These calculi, often found in the urinary bladder, can appear pointed or speculated, resembling a "jack stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. They are composed of monohydrate calcium oxalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

### Soft Tissue Rim Sign
On CT scan, an impacted ureteric calculus may show a soft tissue rim around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This rim represents the thickened, edematous ureteric wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This sign helps distinguish an impacted ureteric calculus from phleboliths (calcifications along pelvic vein walls), which typically show comet tail artifacts on CT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Hydronephrosis on USG
If a [[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | renal calculus]] becomes obstructive, it can lead to hydronephrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. On ultrasound, hydronephrosis appears as dilated calyces and renal pelvis, filled with anechoic fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

## Differentiation from Other Calculi
### Gallbladder Calculi (GB Calculi)
The most common composition of [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | gallbladder calculi]] is mixed calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>, which often have poor calcium content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Due to this, they may not be easily identified on CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. Therefore, the investigation of choice for [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | gallbladder calculi]] is ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

### Common Bile Duct (CBD) Calculi
Tracing the CBD in its entirety via ultrasound can be challenging, especially the terminal portion near the duodenum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. For this reason, the investigation of choice for CBD calculi is Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>, where calculi appear as filling defects within the hyperintense bile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

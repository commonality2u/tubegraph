## Purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
Beta blockers are specifically designated for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) to decrease mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. They are useful in CHF patients with reduced ejection fraction and without any exacerbations for a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Approved Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
There are four specific beta blockers approved for decreasing mortality in chronic CHF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>:
*   Bisoprolol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Carvedilol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
*   Metoprolol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Nebivolol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

Nebivolol is a third-generation beta blocker, while bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol are second-generation drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. These four drugs are the only ones that can decrease mortality in chronic CHF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Chronic CHF is a commonly discussed disorder, and understanding its management is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

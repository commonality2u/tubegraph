Dr. Akshhat Koshik, who achieved an impressive rank of eight in the INI CET May 2025 exam, attributes his success not to early exam-specific preparation, but to a focused effort on [[importance_of_foundational_knowledge_in_medicine | building a strong clinical knowledge base]] throughout his MBBS journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes learning to be a competent doctor first, which naturally aids in competitive exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Early Learning Philosophy: Focus on Being a Good Doctor

From the second year of his MBBS at AIIMS Delhi, Dr. Akshhat chose not to approach his studies with the intense stress often associated with PG exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Instead, he prioritized absorbing knowledge and understanding concepts deeply, viewing it as a "low energy task" rather than a high-pressure one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. His main goal was to optimize his clinical understanding throughout his four and a half years of MBBS before internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

He began using Marrow videos from his second year, initially watching only one to three videos per day to allow time for the knowledge to sink in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This gradual approach facilitated better absorption of information from videos, college lectures, and patient interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Integrating Theory with Clinical Experience

Dr. Akshhat highlights the symbiotic relationship between theoretical learning and clinical postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He found that Marrow videos significantly enhanced his understanding during clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Proactive Learning and Deeper Understanding
His curiosity drove him to look up any unfamiliar terms mentioned by faculties, even if they weren't in the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. This proactive approach led to deep understanding. For instance, while studying cardiology, he Googled different types of pulses, which helped him answer an INI CET exam question on Frank-Starling law and pulse types, a topic not specifically taught for the exam but integrated from physiology and medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This illustrates how [[importance_of_building_strong_basics_in_undergraduate_medicine | strong foundational knowledge]] can directly translate to success in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Personalized Note-Taking for Effective Revision
While he relied on hard copy notes due to his handwriting, he personalized them by adding extra information, mnemonic devices, or simplified explanations in his own language, including slangs, right onto the printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This method saved him from extensive writing and made the notes highly effective for revision, as the personalized content became photographically memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. He emphasizes using the same source for revision repeatedly to build this photographic memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## Internship: Clinical Revision, Not Exam Prep

During his internship, Dr. Akshhat largely abstained from dedicated PG exam studying, making sure to enjoy his time and take breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. He only took one Grand Test (GT) during 11 months of internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. His robust clinical base meant that real-life patient interactions served as a continuous "clinical revision" of his already ingrained knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>. For example, diagnosing and treating a hypothyroid child in his rural internship cemented his understanding of that disease without needing to explicitly study it from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

> "If you're in the OPD, focus on the OPD. If you have decided to take a break, take the break. But if you have decided to do something, then do it or just give yourself a chance to not do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>
> â€” Dr. Akshhat Koshik

## Final Preparation: Targeted and Confident

His strong foundation allowed him to approach the crucial last few months (January to May) before the exam with a "targeted consistent approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. He primarily focused on:
*   **Previous Year Questions (PQs)**: Solving all 8-9 years of NEET PG and INI CET PQs, recognizing that 130-140 questions in the exam are often repackaged versions of previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
*   [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | Utilizing Custom Modules]]: He extensively used custom modules on the go, even while walking or in a cab, to practice [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | solving MCQs]] within a time crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. He categorized study methods into high, middle, and low energy tasks, allowing him to choose low-energy activities like watching delta revision or MCQ videos when exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: He gave eight GTs from February onwards, dedicating more time to reviewing all 200 questions of each GT than to giving the test itself, ensuring he understood the underlying concepts of even correctly answered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

His long-term approach meant he could remain calm before and during the exam, a crucial factor in performing his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.

## Advice for Juniors

Dr. Akshhat's core advice for aspiring doctors is to [[effective_study_strategies_for_firstyear_mbbs_students | start early]] to allow for deep learning and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. He emphasizes that "the journey is yours and make it yours and completely own it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. There is no single "correct way" to prepare; finding an optimized balance that works for you is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Ultimately, deep knowledge, once ingrained, cannot be taken away and serves as a powerful foundation for both practice and exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.

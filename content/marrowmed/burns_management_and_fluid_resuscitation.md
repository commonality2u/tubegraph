## Burns Assessment and Classification

Burns assessment often utilizes the [[burns_assessment_and_calculation | Wallace rule of nine]] to estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. It is crucial to remember that first-degree burns, such as singing of eyebrows, are not included in the calculation of the [[burns_assessment_and_calculation | Wallace rule of nine]] or in the fluid calculation for formulas like Parkland's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

### Rule of Nine Application
For an adult patient:
*   Each upper limb accounts for 9% TBSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
*   The anterior thorax (upper) accounts for 9% TBSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

For example, a patient with bilateral upper limb burn and upper anterior thorax burn would have an estimated 27-30% TBSA burn (9% + 9% + 9%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. It is generally advised to focus on the [[burns_assessment_and_calculation | Wallace rule of nine]] and not the more complicated Lundon router classification for exam purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Fluid Resuscitation in Burns

### Colloid Use
Colloids, such as albumin, are used in burns management, but *only* after the first 12 hours following the injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Using colloids or albumin within the initial 12 hours can be counterproductive and may cause more dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. This is because massive fluid shifts lead to proteins leaking out of the cells due to "leaky vessels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. If albumin is administered during this early phase, it can leak out and cause increased edema and third-space loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

The Muir and Barclay formula is a commonly used colloid-based fluid resuscitation formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. The formula is calculated as 0.5 multiplied by the body percentage area burnt, multiplied by the patient's weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>. One portion of this calculated fluid is given every four hours for the first 12 hours, and then every six hours for the next 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

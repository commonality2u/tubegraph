Dr. Ashwini Kumar, in a recall session for the INICET May 2025 anatomy paper, highlighted key areas and trends for future INICET exams. While the May 2025 exam showed some variation, traditionally important topics remain central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## General Trends and Preparation Advice
The INICET May 2025 anatomy paper demonstrated a slight variation in the emphasis of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
However, it is crucial not to be biased by the trends of a single paper, as previous patterns often reappear in subsequent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For instance, while neuroanatomy and embryology were not heavily featured in this particular exam, they have historically been "heavily loaded" topics in INICET and may return with significant weight in future exams like the November INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:11">[01:1:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:2:23">[01:2:23]</a>.

The paper frequently includes image-based questions that test the identification of gross anatomical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Many questions are integrated, overlapping with other subjects such as surgery, ENT, physiology, and histology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

> "Do not get biased by looking at this one paper because you know you there are there are hundreds of example earlier also when you will see that when there generally the topic which are heavily loaded in the INIC which usually are the embryology and the neuro anatomy and headneck though it was there and this time it was not there to be seen much u but again November INICT coming up that again can surprise you and you can again see the loads and loads of question in that part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

> "The questions are asked in a very integrated manner they they it's the core anatomy questions are few... but then majority of the questions are overlapping with other surgical subjects as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>

### Key Preparation Strategies for INICET
*   **Prioritize core anatomy topics**: [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | Head and Neck]], [[detailed_pathology_topics_for_inict_and_neet | Neuroanatomy]], and Embryology should be high-priority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on compartments**: Understand the muscles within each compartment of the upper and lower limbs and their innervation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Master nerve supply and injuries**: This remains a primary target in upper and lower limb anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.
*   **Study the gluteal region**: Detailed understanding of gluteal muscles, nerves, and their actions (e.g., Trendelenburg test) is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
*   **Familiarize with sectional anatomy**: Especially for the thorax, understanding the mediastinal structures from front views and then visualizing horizontal sections is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.
*   **Review [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | Previous Year Questions]] and Previous Year Topics**: Look around the topics that have been asked, not just the exact questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

## Specific Anatomical Areas and Topics

### Limbs
*   **Ulnar Nerve**: Questions about its deep branch and specific muscle innervation in the hand are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:2:27">[00:2:27]</a>. For example, knowing which muscles are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve versus the superficial branch or the main nerve in the forearm is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Peroneal Nerve**: Knowledge of muscles supplied by the superficial peroneal nerve (e.g., peroneus longus and brevis) and understanding the distinction from the deep peroneal nerve (e.g., peroneus tertius, extensors) is frequently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The common peroneal nerve injury is also a common topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Gluteal Region**: Questions on gluteus maximus (origin, insertion, and action, especially extension and abduction at the hip) are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | Trendelenburg test]] and the actions of gluteus medius and minimus (internal rotators, abductors) are also frequently asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Pelvic Diaphragm**: Identification of the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani) in coronal sections has been tested previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

### Head and Neck
*   **Muscles of Mastication**: The lateral pterygoid muscle is a particularly favored topic, with questions frequently asked about its action, attachment, association with the articular disc, or role in anterior dislocation of the TMJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. Depression (opening of mouth) and protrusion are key bilateral actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Unilateral action causes jaw deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Cranial Nerves**:
    *   **Olfaction**: Understanding the involvement of cranial nerves in olfaction, including those that detect pungent or irritating odors (Trigeminal nerve) and the enhancing role of taste nerves (Facial, Glossopharyngeal, Vagus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. Purely motor nerves like the Hypoglossal nerve are typically not involved in sensory functions like olfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
    *   **Pyroform Fossa**: Identification of the nerve responsible for irritation when a foreign body (e.g., fishbone) is lodged in the pyroform fossa (internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. Injury to this nerve leads to sensory loss above the vocal cords and loss of cough reflex, risking aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   **Dural Innervation**: The innervation of the dura mater is important because it is the only innervated structure in the cranial cavity, making it responsible for referred pain in headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Pain from inflammation in the posterior cranial fossa, supplied by C2 and C3 cervical nerves (directly or via Vagus and Hypoglossal nerves), refers to the back of the head and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Cleft Lip Surgery**: The orbicularis oris muscle is the primary muscle requiring repair in cleft lip surgery, important for both aesthetic and functional reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

### Thorax
*   **Transverse Sections of Thorax**: The INICET specifically focuses on transverse sections of the thorax, requiring candidates to identify mediastinal structures at different vertebral levels (e.g., T6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

### Histology and Integration
*   **Respiratory System Histology**: Identification of structures like the respiratory bronchiole based on features like cuboidal epithelium and out-pockets (alveoli) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. Distinguishing from terminal bronchioles (continuous smooth muscle, wavy lumen) or bronchi (hyaline cartilage, pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Pancreatic Histology**: Identification of the islets of Langerhans, the endocrine region of the pancreas, and understanding the paracrine signaling between its cells (e.g., beta cells inhibiting alpha cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

### Abdomen
*   **Hepatocystic Triangle (Triangle of Calot)**: Knowledge of its boundaries (inferior border of liver, common hepatic duct, cystic duct) and contents (cystic artery) is a recurring question, often integrated with surgical contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Pelvic Structures**: Identification of structures surrounding the bladder, such as the vas deferens, ureter ("water under the bridge"), seminal vesicle, and prostate gland in sectional views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

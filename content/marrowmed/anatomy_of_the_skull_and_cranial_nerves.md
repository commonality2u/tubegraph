## Skull Base Foramina and Fissures

The skull base features various openings, such as foramina, through which structures like nerves and vessels pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Knowledge of these openings and the structures they transmit is crucial, as tumors compressing these structures can lead to specific clinical features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Superior Orbital Fissure
The Superior Orbital Fissure is located between the lesser wing and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is situated at the junction of the roof and the lateral wall of the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The Superior Orbital Fissure is divided into three compartments by the common tendinous ring, which provides a common origin for the four rectus muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   **Superolateral Compartment**: Structures passing through this compartment include the lacrimal nerve, frontal nerve, and trochlear nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The superior ophthalmic vein also passes through the superolateral aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Intermediate Compartment (Common Tendinous Ring)**: Structures passing through here include the superior division of the oculomotor nerve, the nasociliary nerve, the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve, and the abducent nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Inferomedial Compartment**: The inferior ophthalmic vein passes through this compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), abducent (VI), and ophthalmic (V1) nerves are related to and pass through the Superior Orbital Fissure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These same four nerves are also related to the cavernous sinus before entering the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Cranial Nerves and Sensory Pathways

[[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | Cranial nerves]] are crucial for sensory and motor functions of the head and neck.

### Oculomotor Nerve (III), Trochlear Nerve (IV), and Abducent Nerve (VI)
These three [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] supply the extraocular muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. All extraocular muscles are supplied by the oculomotor nerve (III) except for the superior oblique, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve (IV), and the lateral rectus, which is supplied by the abducent nerve (VI) (mnemonic: SO4, LR6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Trigeminal Nerve (V)
The trigeminal nerve is primarily a sensory nerve to the face, dividing into three main divisions:
*   **Ophthalmic Nerve (V1)**: A sensory nerve that carries sensations from the forehead, scalp, upper eyelid, and the tip and dorsum of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Maxillary Nerve (V2)**: Carries sensory fibers from the upper lip, the side of the nose, and the cheek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It also carries sensation from the nasopharynx and nasal cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Mandibular Nerve (V3)**: Carries sensory fibers from the chin and the adjoining area of the auricle and temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It is responsible for sensation from the chin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The entire face receives sensory supply from the trigeminal nerve, with one important exception: the skin over the angle of the mandible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Sensory fibers from this area (also known as the shaving area) are carried by the great auricular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX) and Vagus Nerve (X)
These nerves are involved in the gag reflex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. When the posterior one-third of the tongue is touched, the afferent (sensory) fibers are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and the efferent (motor) fibers, leading to the contraction of constrictor muscles and palatal muscles, are carried by the vagus nerve (X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Thus, [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | cranial nerves]] IX and X are involved in the gag reflex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Clinical Implications

### [[clinical_implications_of_cranial_nerve_injuries | Cranial Nerve Injuries]]
Compression of the ophthalmic nerve can lead to a loss of sensation in the anterior scalp and the dorsum of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

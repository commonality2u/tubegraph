Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart condition characterized by four distinct components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. Understanding these components is crucial for diagnosis.

## Key Components
The four components of Tetralogy of Fallot are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>:
1.  **Overriding Aorta** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>
2.  **Pulmonary Stenosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>: Specifically, it is the infundibular pulmonary stenosis that is the correct version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:20">[01:47:20]</a>. The noticeable systolic murmur observed in this condition is due to this pulmonary infundibular stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>.
3.  **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>: Not an interatrial septal defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>: Left ventricular hypertrophy is not seen; instead, right ventricular hypertrophy occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
A child with Tetralogy of Fallot might present with cyanosis on crying and a noticeable systolic murmur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Transposition of great vessels is not associated with Tetralogy of Fallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Dr. Rohan's journey to securing an impressive Rank 7 in the INIC November 2024 exam highlights the significant [[the_importance_of_support_systems_in_exam_success | role of support systems]] in exam preparation, both from peers and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. His experience demonstrates how consistent encouragement and accountability can lead to success.

## Peer Accountability and Discipline

After his May INIC attempt, Dr. Rohan identified a major error in his [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | preparation strategies]]: insufficient use of the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. To rectify this, he devised a rigorous plan to complete the entire Marrow QBank within four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This ambitious goal was significantly aided by his peers.

This group of like-minded students formed their own "mini marathon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. By setting a high target and holding each other accountable daily, they fostered [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | discipline]] and regularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The positive impact of this peer support is evident in their results; Dr. Rohan's friend, Sidharth Ravi, also secured a notable rank of 116 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Family's Mental and Emotional Support

Beyond academic resources, Dr. Rohan emphasized the crucial role of his family, particularly his parents, who are both doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. While their medical background didn't directly influence his understanding of the subject matter, their [[balancing_emotions_and_mindset_during_exam_preparation | mental support]] was immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

> "In terms of the mental support they give, that has been a huge [factor]... there are some days where you, you know, just don't feel like doing anything or you feel like giving up. Those are the days where, you know, they'll tell that it's okay, you just need to go through this phase and you know, like we are there with you. So I think that that goes a long way in settling down the nerves. They have helped me a lot sir." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>

This highlights how parental encouragement and presence during challenging phases of [[balancing_study_and_personal_wellbeing_during_exam_preparation | exam preparation]] can be pivotal, helping students overcome feelings of demotivation or despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. His father also acknowledged the role of educational platforms like Marrow in providing comprehensive resources, which acted as a primary source of [[role_of_online_platforms_in_exam_preparation | online platform support]] for Dr. Rohan, negating the need for traditional coaching centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

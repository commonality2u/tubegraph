Dr. Kriti Singh, who achieved a remarkable score of 248 out of 300 in her January 2025 FMG exam on her very first attempt, predominantly relied on [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] as her primary study resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. She subscribed to [[Marrow subscription and its impact on exam preparation | Marrow]] in 2021 during her fourth year of medical school and consistently utilized its features, including main videos, QBank, and Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>.

## Initial Engagement with Marrow

Dr. Singh began her [[Use of Marrow for medical studies | Marrow]] studies with foundational subjects like pathology, aiming to build concepts from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>. Despite a hectic university schedule involving classes, postings, and assignments, she managed to dedicate significant time to [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow]]. Weekends were crucial for academic productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>, and she watched two to three videos daily even during weekdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:09">[04:17:09]</a>.

### Note-Taking and QBank Approach
Initially, Dr. Singh created handwritten notes for all subjects, with OBGY notes alone amounting to approximately a thousand pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:04">[04:37:04]</a>. In her sixth year, she transitioned to using digital notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:04">[04:59:04]</a>. Her initial focus was on understanding concepts and revising notes rather than solving MCQs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:04">[05:21:04]</a>. She started solving QBanks extensively in her sixth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:04">[05:32:04]</a>. This approach of building content first and then moving to MCQs is recognized as a valid preparation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:04">[06:00:04]</a>.

## Preparation Before and After Landing in India

A key recommendation from Dr. Singh, and emphasized by the faculty, is to complete at least 10 to 12 subjects before arriving in India for final preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:04">[06:23:04]</a>. Dr. Singh herself completed all 19 subjects using [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow main videos]] while still in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:04">[08:09:04]</a>, even watching main videos for subjects like OBGY and Surgery twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:04">[08:27:04]</a>. This consistency, even with university assignments and attendance requirements, highlights the feasibility of early preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:04">[08:35:04]</a>.

Upon arriving in India in August, her strategy shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:04">[10:31:04]</a>. From August to October, she focused on watching [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow revision videos]] and solving QBanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:04">[10:38:04]</a>. For most subjects, she relied solely on revision video notes for subsequent reviews, moving away from the main video notes to condense her study material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:04">[09:30:04]</a>.

### Revision Strategy
Starting in November, Dr. Singh planned and successfully executed four full revisions of her notes before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:04">[10:08:04]</a>. Importantly, in the last two months leading up to the exam, she did not solve any new MCQs or QBanks, focusing primarily on revision and Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:04">[10:58:04]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Mock Exams

Dr. Singh began taking [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow GTs]] weekly starting August 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:04">[11:23:04]</a>. Her scores consistently improved, and she observed that the actual FMG exam questions were easier than those in [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow GTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:04">[06:59:04]</a>. She was confident of scoring over 200 marks after the exam, though not expecting her eventual score of 248 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:04">[07:20:04]</a>. Her mock exam score of 243 was highly reflective of her actual exam performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:04">[12:19:04]</a>. In total, she took 20 to 24 GTs before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:04">[12:55:04]</a>.

To review GTs, she maintained a dedicated "GT notebook," where she would record topics corresponding to incorrect answers. She then reviewed these topics from her main notes, focusing on strengthening her weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:04">[13:09:04]</a>.

## QBank and Recall Videos

Dr. Singh completed 597 QBank modules, primarily focusing on the NEET PG modules for major subjects like OBGY, Surgery, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:04">[14:03:04]</a>. While she didn't solve previous year NEET PG or INI-CET questions directly, she watched all the recall videos available on [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]]. She found this method highly effective as faculties not only provided correct answers but also comprehensively reviewed the entire topic, preparing her for related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:04">[15:17:04]</a>. She noted that watching recall videos was particularly beneficial during the last 10 days of preparation or on days when she didn't feel like reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:04">[16:55:04]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow Pearls

Dr. Singh also made use of [[Utilizing educational apps like Marrow for medical studies | Marrow Pearls]] for quick reviews. She would access them on her mobile device while commuting on public transport in Georgia, making productive use of travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:04">[17:30:04]</a>.

## Marrow's Key Features and General Advice

Dr. Singh considers [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow's QBank]] to be its "gold standard" feature, asserting that mastering it and [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow GTs]] enables easy exam cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:04">[18:00:04]</a>. She appreciated all [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow faculties]] for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:04">[18:39:04]</a>.

Her advice to juniors is twofold:
1.  **Start Early**: Begin preparation well in advance, debunking the common misconception that one can start only after reaching India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:04">[19:21:04]</a>.
2.  **Be Consistent**: Consistency throughout the preparation period is non-negotiable for success in any exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:04">[19:34:04]</a>.

She stressed the importance of **concept-based learning** over rote memorization, as the FMG exam is evolving to become more integrated and clinical-based. Strong concepts are vital to solve these evolving questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:04">[20:16:04]</a>.

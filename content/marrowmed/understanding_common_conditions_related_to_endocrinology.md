The field of [[Endocrinology and nephrology in exams | endocrinology and metabolism]] is consistently a vital part of medical examinations, with calcium metabolism being particularly pivotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Clarity in understanding basic facts and practical applications from ward work is crucial for success in these exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Calcium Metabolism and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
Calcium metabolism is extraordinarily important for exams, appearing in various forms, including image-based questions and those related to syndromes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

-   **Clinical Presentation**: A common scenario involves a 25-year-old presenting with recurrent urinary stones and a pathological fracture, showing high calcium and high PTH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
-   **Localization**: For localizing hypercalcemia-associated lesions related to the parathyroid gland, a technetium mibi scan or SPECT system is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. SPECT is considered a superior option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. However, for parathyroid hyperplasia related to [[Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia MEN syndromes | MEN syndromes]], localization is not typically required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
-   **PTH Characteristics**: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has a very short half-life of 2 to 4 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Normal ranges for PTH can be deceptive; what appears normal on a lab report might be considered problematic by a treating doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
-   **Related Conditions**: Questions may also arise concerning hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, pseudohypoparathyroidism, or poly-glandular autoimmune syndromes like APS (Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome) with candidiasis and hypocalcemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

## Renal Stones (Nephrolithiasis)
Understanding the risk factors for recurrent nephrolithiasis is a common exam topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

-   **Key Risk Factors**:
    -   Hyperoxaluria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>
    -   Hypercalciuria: The most common type is idiopathic hypercalciuria, defined as more than 4 mg/kg in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
    -   Hyperuricosuria: More than 7 mg/kg in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
    -   Hypocitraturia: Less than 11 mg/kg in 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. These values can be remembered by the rule of 4 + 7 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
-   **Association with RTA**: Hypocitraturia and hyperuricosuria are primary reasons for stones in patients with renal tubular acidosis type 1, where alkaline urine and calcium phosphate stones are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

## Pituitary and Adrenal Adenomas
Incidentally detected tumors of endocrine glands, such as the pituitary or adrenal, are very important in endocrinology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

-   **Pituitary**: Non-functioning pituitary tumors are more common than functioning ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. Gonadotropin-secreting tumors (e.g., alpha subunit of FSH) are among the common types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
-   **Adrenal**: Incidentally detected adrenal tumors (adrenal "incidentalomas") are crucial to evaluate. Benign adrenal masses are typically lipid-rich, with a density less than 10 Hounsfield Units (HU) on CT, measure less than 4 cm in size, and show good contrast washout (absolute washout >60%, relative washout >40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
-   **Malignancy Risk**: A tumor larger than 4 cm, with a density greater than 10 HU, or poor contrast washout (absolute <60%, relative <40%) suggests a higher risk of [[Association of certain clinical conditions with imaging findings | adrenal cortical carcinoma]] or pheochromocytoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. MRI can help identify pheochromocytomas with signs like the "light bulb sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

## Hyponatremia and ADH
Hyponatremia, regardless of volume status (hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic), is generally caused by an excess of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

-   **Exceptions**: Exceptions where ADH is not the primary cause include psychogenic polydipsia (excessive water intake) or post-operative dilutional hyponatremia, or defects in diluting capacity (e.g., due to diuretics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
-   **Stimuli for ADH**: Increased ADH secretion in conditions like hypovolemic hyponatremia due to severe diarrhea is driven by non-osmotic stimuli related to fluid loss, involving baroreceptor-mediated mechanisms, sympathetic nervous system activation, and RAS (Renin-Angiotensin System) activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
-   **ADH Action**: ADH primarily reabsorbs free water, leading to concentrated urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. It increases water permeability from the collecting duct and promotes urea reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. Increased sodium reabsorption from the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is *not* an action of ADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.

## [[Metabolic disorders in biochemistry for NEET PG exam | Metabolic Disorders]]
### Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1/2)
IGF-1 and IGF-2 molecules are structurally similar to pro-insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

### Diabetic Kidney Disease
[[Presentation and diagnosis of secondary diabetes causes | Diabetic kidney disease]] involves specific glomerular lesions. The Armani lesion, however, is related to the tubule and is not a typical glomerular lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

### Re-feeding Syndrome
Re-feeding syndrome is a high-yield topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. It is triggered by a high-carbohydrate meal in a depleted person, leading to high insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:48]</a>. The most important feature is phosphate depletion (hypophosphatemia), as phosphorus is driven into the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.

### Thyroid Disorders
-   **Follicular Thyroid Cancer**: Lions are associated with follicular thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
-   **Toxicosis**: Iodine intake causing signs of toxicosis is known as the Jod-Basedow phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. This concept is distinct from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.

## Specific Case: [[Understanding neuroendocrine tumors and pancreatic conditions | Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor]]
A 25-year-old male with recurrent urinary stones and a pathological fracture, high calcium, and high PTH could potentially have a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor as part of a [[Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia MEN syndromes | MEN syndrome]] causing hyperparathyroidism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. While the main focus was on calcium metabolism, this hints at the broader context of neuroendocrine conditions.

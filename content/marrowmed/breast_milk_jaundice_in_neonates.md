Breast milk jaundice is a commonly discussed topic in pediatrics, appearing frequently in exams. It is generally considered a benign and self-resolving condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, meaning treatment is often not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Characteristics
Breast milk jaundice is a condition typically observed in exclusively breastfed babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. It is characterized by total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels exceeding 10 mg/dL after 3 to 4 weeks of birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This condition is seen in approximately 3% to 4% of exclusively breastfed infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It is a transient and benign form of neonatal jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Mechanism
[[breast_milk_jaundice_mechanisms | The underlying reason for breast milk jaundice]] involves certain substances present in breast milk that deconjugate bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. One such substance is beta-glucuronidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This enzyme converts conjugated bilirubin back into unconjugated bilirubin, leading to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the body and contributing to jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Management
Breastfeeding should rarely be stopped in cases of breast milk jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The condition is usually self-resolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> and will typically settle on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Most affected children do not require phototherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

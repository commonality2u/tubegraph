Dr. Hamza, who secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 9 in the INI CET November exam and an AIR of 185 in the NEET PG exam, attributes his success in part to his strategic utilization of Q banks and test series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, particularly the Marrow platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes the critical role of [[importance_of_using_a_qbank_for_exam_preparation | MCQ practice]] in improving one's rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

## Marrow Q Bank Effectiveness

### Quality and Explanations
Dr. Hamza found the quality of questions in the Marrow Q bank to be "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. He highlighted several key features that aided his preparation:
*   **Concise and Crisp Explanations**: The explanations were "very concise but a very crisp and a very good explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Images**: The Q bank included "certain images" of "very good quality" which encouraged him to solve more questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **"Pearls" for Broad Perspective**: Explanations often provided "certain pearls in the end" that offered a "very broad perspective of everything that you should know about that particular topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Strategic Question Solving
Having joined Marrow just two months before the exam, Dr. Hamza prioritized his approach to question-solving:
*   **Initial Focus on PYQs**: His first priority was solving Previous Year Questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Question Target**: He aimed to complete "at least 200 questions per day" to stay on track and improve his [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | McQ skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Module Approach**: Each day, he would focus on one subject, solving "100 questions pyqs and 100 question I can do from first module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. He preferred focusing on "one subject at a time in the custom module" to ensure every single subject was covered thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Bookmark Strategy
Dr. Hamza developed a nuanced bookmarking strategy to make the most of the explanations:
*   He would quickly read through explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   He recommended bookmarking not only questions answered incorrectly but also those answered correctly if they contained information that might be forgotten or extra valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. For example, he bookmarked an Ob-Gyn question about a Sims speculum because its explanation included images and details of other instruments he couldn't identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Developing MCQ Skills
A common challenge in exam preparation is narrowing down options to the correct answer, especially when two options seem plausible. Dr. Hamza explains that this is a skill that "comes with the question practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Even with "out of the box" questions, practice helps in ruling out incorrect options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. He stresses that this skill "will develop over the time" and requires consistent daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | Reviewing questions]] and Grand Tests (GTs) is crucial to learn the correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

### Correlation with Actual Exam
Dr. Hamza found that the ranks obtained in Marrow GTs "very closely correlate" with the actual exam ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This correlation provides a realistic sense of how one might perform in the main exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Attempt Strategy
When taking GTs, Dr. Hamza always attempted all 200 questions, seeing them as opportunities to "take as many chances as you want to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. In the real exam, however, he was more selective, attempting 196 questions and only leaving four questions that were "completely out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. The number of questions attempted depends on the "level of your preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

Preparing for the [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]] requires dedication, strategic planning, and consistent effort. Yashaswi, who achieved the highest score of 257 out of 300 in this year's [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]], shares his [[preparation_strategies_for_fmge | strategies for preparing for FMGE]] using Marrow.

## Setting Goals and Maintaining Motivation

Yashaswi's journey began with setting a clear goal: to score 300 out of 300 in the [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]], mirroring his past NEET UG score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This goal was a constant source of motivation, and he even created a manifestation photograph that he kept in front of his study table, seeing it daily as a reminder of his aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This positive thinking and unwavering goal-setting were crucial to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Effective Use of Marrow

Yashaswi started using Marrow's Plan C after finishing his fourth year of MBBS, around 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. His approach to utilizing Marrow involved:

### Video Lectures
*   **Pace:** Watching all main videos at his own pace without rushing, focusing on building strong concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Revision:** In his final year, he began watching Rapid Revision videos to concisely review all the material studied over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. However, for a score above 200, conceptual questions require knowledge from main videos, not just revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.
*   **Pearls:** He utilized Marrow's Pearls for confusing topics and minor subjects, finding the images, tables, and charts very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.
*   **College Exams:** Studying with Marrow during college helped reinforce concepts, which also aided him in his college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. It's recommended for FMG students to finish all videos while in college to benefit their college exams and then focus on questions once back in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

### QBank Strategies
*   **Choice of QBank:** Yashaswi exclusively used the NEET PG QBank from start to finish, aiming for a high score of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Immediate Practice:** He solved QBank questions immediately after completing a topic to reinforce concepts and identify areas requiring more focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Feature:** He effectively utilized Marrow's three bookmarking features:
    *   **Red Mark:** For questions with less than 30-50% correct answers, to understand the questions for future attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Mark:** For questions with extensive explanations, to gain theoretical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Blue Mark:** For previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Completion Rate:** By the end of his college days, he had completed over 85% of the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. He then used the "Clean Slate" feature to reset and solve them again after returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Practice:** In the last six months leading up to the exam, he solved more than 100 questions daily, including custom modules of PYQs, incorrect questions from the QBank, and a mix bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. He emphasized that the [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | FMGE exam]] is an MCQ exam, so daily MCQ solving is crucial alongside theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTS) and Mocks

Yashaswi recommends giving tests and GTS, and not shying away from them even if scores are low initially. The key is to analyze weak subjects and improve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

*   **Early Baseline GT:** He gave a baseline GT early in his fourth year to gauge his standing, scoring 133 and skipping many questions due to unfamiliarity with the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This motivated him to prepare sincerely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** He started giving GTS sincerely in the last two years, including all live GTS and over 40-50 total GTS, along with all subject and mini tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
*   **Performance Progression:** His scores gradually improved from 177-188 to 204 in October of the previous year, then to 212, 230, and consistently above 200 in all live [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | FMGE GTS]] in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.
*   **Review Strategy:** He only reviewed incorrect questions from GTS, creating custom modules to convert his incorrect answers into correct ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

## Routine and Discipline

Yashaswi's parents attested to his disciplined routine after returning from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. He prioritized consistent study throughout the day but never compromised on sleep, ensuring 7-8 hours of rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. He believed in focusing completely during study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

## Revision Strategy (Last Six Months)

In the final six months before the [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]], Yashaswi's [[effective_fmge_preparation_strategies | effective FMGE preparation strategies]] focused heavily on revision:

*   **Revision Videos and Notes:** He watched Rapid Revision videos once and then got the notes printed out to read them. He did not watch any more videos during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   **Core Strategy:** His main strategy was to focus on revision notes, solve the QBank, and give GTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Revisions:** He aimed for and succeeded in completing four to five revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

## Tackling Weak Subjects and Tricky Exams

Yashaswi's strongest subject fluctuated, but Pathology consistently stood out due to excellent videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. His weaker subject was PY, which "hammered" his brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

*   **Weak Subject Approach:** He focused on important topics within weaker subjects, believing they could become stronger with consistent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. He stopped over-focusing on stronger subjects and instead revised weaker ones multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   **Tricky Exam Handling:** He noted that the recent [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam]] was tricky and lengthy, with questions ranging from superficial to very deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. He emphasized that main videos are essential for conceptual questions, as revision videos alone might not suffice for a high score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. His [[ent_exam_questions_and_strategies | tip for exam takers]] is to focus on reading the question carefully and identifying the important line the examiner provides to get the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

## Advice for Future Aspirants

Yashaswi's [[advice for future FMGE exam takers | advice for future FMGE exam takers]] is to not underestimate themselves. He encourages diligence and focusing on the process, as hard work will lead to success, regardless of initial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. He plans to apply the same dedication to his NEET PG exam preparation, aiming for 100% and a specialization in Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.

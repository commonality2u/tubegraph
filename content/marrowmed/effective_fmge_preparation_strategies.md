Dr. Rajeswari from Kakara District, Andhra Pradesh, secured an impressive score of 246 in the FMGE January 2025 examination after completing her undergraduate studies in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Her success highlights several [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | effective preparation strategies]] for the exam.

## Early and Consistent Preparation

Dr. Rajeswari began her [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation]] for the FMGE exam in her fifth year of undergraduation, taking a Marrow subscription with a two-year duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This early start allowed her to maintain a strong grasp on the material closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. She chose Marrow because of its reputation for NEET PG and INICET [[preparation strategies for FMGE | preparation]], believing that preparing at a NEET PG level would ensure good scores in FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The quality of questions in FMGE is becoming similar to NEET PG, often featuring clinical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow Resources

### Video Lectures and Note-Taking
Dr. Rajeswari dedicated four to five hours daily to watching Marrow videos, usually at 1.5x or 1.8x speed for familiar subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. She meticulously prepared her own notes from these videos, including diagrams for subjects like anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

For shorter subjects, she utilized revision videos during her final year due to time constraints, also making notes from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If she encountered points in revision videos that she didn't fully understand, she would refer back to the regular videos for a complete understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This approach emphasized understanding the concept rather than just watching videos or doing question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Question Bank Integration
Immediately after watching videos, she would tackle the corresponding modules in the question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Any new information found in the question bank was added to her notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. She aimed to complete almost all question bank topics, focusing on difficult ones later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This immediate practice helped her understand and revise the content better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Dr. Rajeswari started taking Grand Tests in October 2024 and achieved good scores, which mirrored her performance in the main exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. She emphasized overcoming the fear of low scores in GTs, as they provide an "actual exam feel" and help identify weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. After each GT, she utilized the analytics to identify weak subjects and revised them, sometimes even revising strong subjects if tricky questions made them appear weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Custom Modules
In her last three to four months of [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]], Dr. Rajeswari heavily relied on Marrow's custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. She would do about four custom modules a day, each with 50 questions, totaling around 200 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This feature, allowing for random questions across all subjects, built her confidence and kept her in touch with various question types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## [[advice_for_future_fmge_exam_takers | Advice for Future FMGE Exam Takers]]

Dr. Rajeswari offers key recommendations for aspiring FMGE candidates:
*   **Integrate Video Lectures and Modules**: Watch videos and immediately do the corresponding question bank modules to clear conceptual doubts and identify mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Utilize Custom Modules**: Even if all 19 subjects aren't completed, use custom modules for subjects already finished to gain integrated correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Grand Tests**: Low scores initially are normal; consistent effort will gradually increase scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Start GTs early to get accustomed to the exam scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Consistency is Key**: Be consistent with video lectures, question banks, and tests. Use GT analytics to identify and improve on weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

She also praised the Marrow faculty for simplifying complex topics, making them easily understandable in a single attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Dr. Rajeswari plans to continue her [[strategies for preparing for FMGE and INICET exams | preparation during internship]] for NEET PG and INICET exams, leveraging the knowledge base she has already built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

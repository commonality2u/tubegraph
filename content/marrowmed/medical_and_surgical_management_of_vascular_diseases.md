Vascular diseases can manifest as either [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | chronic arterial occlusion]], which is a gradual process, or [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | acute arterial occlusion]], which occurs suddenly due to an embolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | Chronic arterial occlusion]] is typically caused by a thrombus that gradually increases in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. As the thrombus grows, collaterals may develop, supplying some area below the block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations

### Intermittent Claudication
Intermittent claudication is characterized by cramping pain felt after walking a certain distance, known as the claudication distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This pain can progress to rest pain or gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The pain is usually felt one level lower than the arterial block because collaterals supply the area below the obstruction, causing muscles in that region to hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Intermittent claudication needs to be differentiated from other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:
*   **Vascular Claudication:** Pain occurs after walking a certain distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Neurogenic Claudication:** Pain varies with posture, is relieved by bending forwards, and aggravated by standing straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It is caused by lumbar canal stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Maximum pain is felt on the first step, and the pain is located in the affected joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Fontaine Classification
The Fontaine classification is used for claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>:
*   **Class 1:** Pain on walking, but pain reduces as the patient continues to walk, possibly due to substance P being washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Class 2:** Patient experiences pain on walking but continues to walk despite the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Class 3:** Pain forces the patient to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Class 4:** Patient develops rest pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Aortoiliac Obstruction (Leriche Syndrome)
Aortoiliac obstruction, also known as Leriche syndrome, is characterized by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   Buttock claudication, which is often the earliest feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Claudication can also occur in the thigh or calves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Absent femoral and distal pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   A bruit (murmur) over the iliac region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Impotence in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Diagnostic Tools

### Duplex or Doppler Scan
The investigation of choice for aortoiliac obstruction is a duplex or Doppler scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. A duplex scan combines Doppler with B-mode ultrasound, providing anatomical information about the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)
ABPI is calculated as the maximum systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the maximum systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Normal value:** 0.9 to 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Value less than 0.9:** Can indicate intermittent claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Value less than 0.4:** Indicates chronic limb-threatening ischemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

In healthy individuals, ABPI increases post-exercise due to increased blood flow to the lower limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, in patients with an arterial block, post-exercise ABPI values will fall, which helps differentiate them from healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. An ABPI less than 0.5 doubles the likelihood of faster deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A gradually decreasing ABPI signifies imminent limb loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. ABPI also indicates cardiac mortality risk: a 0.1 decrease in ABPI below 0.9 increases cardiac mortality by 10% for every 0.1% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is characterized by rest pain with or without ulceration or gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI)
In patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, ABPI can be falsely high (more than 1.4) due to calcified vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Digital arteries are rarely affected by sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Therefore, TBPI, in correlation with ABPI, is more reliable for identifying vascular disease in diabetic patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. In diabetics, a falsely high ABPI (greater than 1.4) combined with a TBPI less than 0.6 denotes a significant arterial lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)
Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) provides dynamic inflow and imaging information, offering good anatomical detail of the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. However, it is an invasive procedure involving dye injection, with risks of bleeding, thrombosis, aneurysm, and renal dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. DSA is typically performed when an intervention is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Causes of Chronic Arterial Occlusion

Two main causes of [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | chronic arterial occlusion]] are Buerger's disease and atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)
Also known as Thromboangiitis Obliterans (TAO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, Buerger's disease:
*   Typically affects males in their third decade of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Primarily affects the lower limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   The main risk factor is smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Involves the artery, vein, and nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Exhibits distal-to-proximal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   Involves small to medium-sized vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   Angiography may show "screw collaterals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Diagnosis can be confirmed by muscle biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Often presents with gradual desiccation and a clear line of demarcation in cases of gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis:
*   Starts in the fifth decade of life with equal incidence in males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Also affects the lower limbs more commonly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Risk factors include smoking, Type A personality, alcohol, and hyperlipidemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   Only involves the artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Exhibits proximal-to-distal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   Involves large to medium-sized vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

> [!caution] Differentiating Buerger's Disease and Atherosclerosis
> Smoking history alone should not lead to a blind diagnosis of Buerger's disease; age is a crucial factor. For example, a 65-year-old patient with smoking history and claudication is more likely to have atherosclerosis than Buerger's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Management

### Management of Buerger's Disease
The management of Buerger's disease includes:
*   **Smoking cessation:** This is a crucial intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Pentoxifylline:** An approved medication for Buerger's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Conservative amputations:** Only the involved portion needs to be amputated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Lumbar sympathectomy:** Can be performed for rest pain to reduce pain by causing cutaneous vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. It is contraindicated in claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. If bilateral lumbar sympathectomy is planned, the L1 ganglion should be saved on at least one side to prevent impotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
Bypass graftings are generally not useful in Buerger's disease because the distal small vessels are often blocked, making it difficult to send blood effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Management of Atherosclerosis
The management of atherosclerosis primarily involves angioplasty and bypass grafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

#### Angioplasty
Angioplasty is often the first-line intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It is successful for femoropopliteal obstructions but less useful for below-knee obstructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
Possible [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | complications related to surgery and postoperative care]] of angioplasty include failure, hematoma, bleeding, and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Angioplasty involves placing a stent to restore blood flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

#### Bypass Grafting
Bypass grafting is considered the best surgical option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Above Inguinal Grafts:** For obstructions like aortoiliac obstruction (Leriche syndrome), an aortobifemoral graft (from the aorta to both femoral vessels) is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The best graft material for above-inguinal bypass is Dacron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Infrainguinal Grafts:**
    *   The best overall graft for infrainguinal bypass is the reverse saphenous vein graft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
    *   The best synthetic graft for infrainguinal bypass is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
    *   When harvesting the great saphenous vein for a reverse saphenous vein graft, the saphenous nerve can be injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

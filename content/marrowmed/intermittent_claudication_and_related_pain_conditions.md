Intermittent claudication is a symptom commonly associated with [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | chronic arterial occlusion]], which is a gradual blockage of an artery due to a thrombus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As the thrombus grows, collateral circulation can develop, supplying some area below the block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Intermittent claudication is characterized by cramping pain felt after walking a certain distance, known as the claudication distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The pain typically occurs one level lower than the arterial block because collateral vessels supply the area just below the blockage, but the muscles further down eventually experience ischemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This condition can progress to rest pain and gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Differentiating Claudication Types

It is crucial to differentiate between vascular claudication and other conditions that cause leg pain, such as neurogenic claudication and osteoarthritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Vascular Claudication:** Pain occurs after walking a specific distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Neurogenic Claudication:** Pain varies with posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, is relieved by bending forwards, and aggravated by standing straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This is typically due to Lumbar Canal Stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Maximum pain is felt on the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, affecting the joint itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Rutherford-Boeh Classification for Claudication

The Rutherford-Boeh classification describes the progression of claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>:
*   **Class One:** Patient experiences pain on walking, but the pain reduces as they continue to walk. This is attributed to substance P, the pain-causing agent, getting washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Class Two:** Patient has pain on walking but continues to walk despite the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Class Three:** Pain forces the patient to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Class Four:** Patient develops rest pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Specific Clinical Conditions

### Leriche Syndrome (Aortoiliac Obstruction)

This condition involves an obstruction at the aortoiliac level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Key features include:
*   Buttock claudication, which is the earliest feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Claudication can also be in the thigh or calves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Absent femoral and distal pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   A bruit (swishing sound) over the iliac region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Impotence in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   The investigation of choice is a duplex or Doppler scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The pain location relative to the block varies by obstruction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:
*   **Aortoiliac:** Thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   **Femoropopliteal:** Calf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   **Distal Obstruction:** Ankle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

## Diagnostic Tools

### [[ankle_brachial_pressure_index_and_its_clinical_importance | Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)]]

ABPI is a crucial diagnostic tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It is calculated as the maximum systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the maximum systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Normal Value:** 0.9 to 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.9:** Indicates intermittent claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.4:** Suggests [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | chronic limb-threatening ischemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, characterized by rest pain with or without ulceration or gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Post-Exercise ABPI:** In normal individuals, ABPI increases after exercise due to increased blood flow to the lower limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. However, in patients with a block, post-exercise ABPI values will fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Prognosis:** Patients with ABPI less than 0.5 are twice as likely to deteriorate faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A gradually decreasing ABPI indicates imminent limb loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Cardiac Mortality Risk:** A 0.1 decrease in ABPI below 0.9 increases cardiac mortality risk by 10% for every 0.1 drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI)

TBPI is particularly useful in patients with diabetes mellitus or [[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | chronic kidney disease]] who may have falsely high ABPI (more than 1.4) due to calcified vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   Digital arteries are rarely affected by sclerosis, making TBPI a more reliable indicator of [[medical_and_surgical_management_of_vascular_diseases | vascular disease]] in diabetics when correlated with ABPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   In diabetics, a falsely high ABPI (greater than 1.4) combined with a TBPI less than 0.6 denotes a significant arterial lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)

DSA provides dynamic inflow and imaging information, offering detailed anatomy of the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   It involves dye injection and carries risks such as bleeding, thrombosis, aneurysm, and renal dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   DSA is typically performed when an intervention is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Causes of Chronic Arterial Occlusion

The two main causes of chronic arterial occlusion are Buerger's disease and atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)

*   **Prevalence:** Occurs in the third decade of life, primarily affecting males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Risk Factor:** Main risk factor is smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. (Note: Smoking is also a risk factor for atherosclerosis, so age must be considered in diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.)
*   **Affected Tissues:** Involves the artery, vein, and nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Spread:** Exhibits distal-to-proximal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, involving small to medium-sized vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, particularly in the [[arterial_and_nerve_supply_of_the_leg | lower limbs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Angiography Findings:** Characterized by "screw collaterals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** Can be confirmed by muscle biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Management:**
    *   Smoking cessation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
    *   Pentoxifylline is an approved medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   Conservative amputations are performed only on the involved portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   [[lumbar_puncture_procedures_and_related_complications | Lumbar sympathectomy]] can be done for rest pain to cause cutaneous vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, but is contraindicated in claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. If bilateral lumbar sympathectomy is planned, the L1 ganglion should be saved on at least one side to prevent impotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   Bypass graftings are generally not useful because the distal vessels are already blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Atherosclerosis

*   **Prevalence:** Starts in the fifth decade of life, with equal incidence in males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Risk Factors:** Smoking, Type A personality, alcohol, and hyperlipidemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Affected Tissues:** Primarily involves the artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Spread:** Starts in large, proximal vessels and then progresses to smaller vessels (proximal-to-distal spread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, affecting the [[arterial_and_nerve_supply_of_the_leg | lower limbs]] more commonly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Angioplasty:** Has become the first-line intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. It is successful for popliteal and femoral regions but less useful below the knee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Potential complications include failure, hematoma, bleeding, and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
    *   **Bypass Grafting:** Considered the best treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
        *   **Above Inguinal Grafts (e.g., for Leriche Syndrome):** Dacron is the best graft material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
        *   **Infrainguinal Grafts:**
            *   Best overall graft: Reverse saphenous vein graft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
            *   Best synthetic graft: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
            *   During harvesting of the great saphenous vein, the saphenous nerve can be injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The midbrain is a crucial part of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] that can be examined from both its ventral and dorsal aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Ventral Aspect of the Midbrain

On the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | ventral aspect]] of the midbrain, several key structures and nerve emergences are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Cerebral Peduncle
The cerebral peduncle is a prominent part of the midbrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Function**: It contains [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | descending tracts]] originating from the cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Nomenclature**: It is also known as the *crus cerebri* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The name "cerebral peduncle" refers to its function of giving passage to these descending tracts of the cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Interpeduncular Fossa
Between the two cerebral peduncles lies a space known as the interpeduncular fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Contents**:
    *   Mammillary bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Infundibulum of the pituitary gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Cranial Nerve Emergence**: The third [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] (oculomotor nerve) emerges from the interpeduncular fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is the only nerve seen emerging from *inside* the peduncle itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Dorsal Aspect of the Midbrain

The [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]], including the midbrain, is visible after the cerebellum is removed, exposing the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Corpora Quadrigemina
In the midbrain section of the dorsal aspect, four rounded eminences collectively known as the corpora quadrigemina are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These consist of:
*   **Superior Colliculi**: Located above the inferior colliculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. They are involved in the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | visual pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The superior colliculi are connected to the lateral geniculate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Inferior Colliculi**: Located below the superior colliculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. They are a component of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The inferior colliculi are connected to the medial geniculate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Geniculate Bodies
Located posterior to the thalamus, the medial and lateral geniculate bodies are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. They are part of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory and visual pathways]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Medial Geniculate Body**: Associated with the auditory pathway ("music") and connected to the inferior colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Lateral Geniculate Body**: Associated with the visual pathway ("light") and connected to the superior colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Cranial Nerve Emergence
The fourth [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] (trochlear nerve) is unique as it is the *only* cranial nerve that emerges from the dorsal aspect of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It is also the thinnest cranial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

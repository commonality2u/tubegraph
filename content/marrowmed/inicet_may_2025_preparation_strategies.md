Dr. Bhavik Chrani achieved an impressive All India Rank (AIR) 10 in the INI CET May 2025 exam, marking his first attempt at this challenging examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A student from Ajmer, Rajasthan, who completed his MBBS from Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College, Ajmer (2019 batch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, Dr. Bhavik shares his [[journey_and_strategy_for_inicet_preparation | preparation journey and strategy]], emphasizing the role of Marrow in his success.

## Early Start and Marrow Integration

Dr. Bhavik began using Marrow from his second professional year, initially being referred by a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. He started by watching the main videos, finding the Pathology lectures by Dr. Ela Mam particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He advises juniors to start their [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | preparation]] as early as possible, even in the first professional year, to gain an edge and become familiar with their study patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

By the end of his third professional year, he had completed almost all Marrow main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The fourth professional year was primarily dedicated to watching revision videos, MCQ discussion videos, and taking subject-wise and grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. He noted that although he didn't receive much clinical exposure in college, Marrow's videos provided a very clinical approach, which helped him understand what to look for in questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Core Study Components

### Video Lectures
Dr. Bhavik relied on Marrow's main videos, revision videos (Edition 5, 6, 6.5, 8), and MCQ discussion videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He found that ENT and Surgery videos were particularly helpful for clear explanations and repetition, which aided memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Question Banks
Initially, during his third professional year, Dr. Bhavik's approach to the question bank was "patchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. He realized the importance of solving questions only towards the end of his third professional year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In his fourth professional year, he reset the question bank and completed it in a systematic, subject-wise manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He emphasized solving questions alongside watching main videos and taking regular subject-wise tests monthly or fortnightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTS) and Mini Tests
Dr. Bhavik started giving Grand Tests (GTS) towards the end of his third professional year and became consistent in his fourth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. He initially took them monthly, then twice a month, and finally every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. He diligently reviewed all GTS, focusing on incorrect and skipped questions first, then quickly glancing over correct ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This meant he was effectively revising all 19 subjects every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

He solved all available subject tests, mini tests, and previous year GTS (even from 2017-2018), believing that topics remain the same despite changes in exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. For the latest pattern, he relied on the new GTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Test-Taking Strategies

### Approach to Questions
Initially, Dr. Bhavik would leave many questions unanswered, but he became more aggressive towards the end of his [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation]], realizing his thinking was often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In the INI CET exam, he marked 195 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Handling Tricky Questions
For tricky questions, he advised skipping them initially, marking for review, and revisiting them later to gain a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. His main strength was his ability to rule out options quickly, often by just looking at the last line of the question, which boosted his speed and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### Using Analytics
He found Marrow's GT analytics and graphs helpful initially to identify weaker subjects, such as Obstetrics and Gynecology (ObsGyne), which he then paid more attention to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Revision Approach

Despite making notes from main videos, revision videos, and MCQ discussion videos, Dr. Bhavik admitted he never actually read them for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. His primary method of revision was through "questions, questions, and questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Dealing with Marrow Editions
During his [[strategies_for_preparing_for_fmge_and_inicet_exams | preparation]], Marrow underwent three edition changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Dr. Bhavik watched the main videos once and then relied on the revision videos and MCQ discussion videos of the newer editions to stay updated, avoiding the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) of re-watching all main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

## Consistency and Mindset

Dr. Bhavik participated in Marrow marathons, which he found great for building consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. He stressed that consistency is the most difficult but crucial aspect of the journey, noting that sporadic intense study is wasteful without continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

He maintained calm due to his innate nature and the confidence gained from thorough [[ini_cet_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. His rank in the last Marrow GT (around 60-70) was close to his actual rank, which also instilled confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Advice for Juniors

Dr. Bhavik advises juniors to:
*   **Start early**: This allows more time to find one's optimal study process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Make mistakes in question banks**: It's better to make errors during practice than in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Don't fear new questions**: If using custom modules for [[pharmacology_mcqs_in_inicet_2025 | pharmacology MCQs in INICET 2025]] or [[strategies_for_neetpg_2025_preparation | NEETPG 2025 preparation]], continue with them even if new questions appear, as it prepares for difficult actual exam scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

Overall, Dr. Bhavik's success underscores the importance of consistent effort, comprehensive use of available resources like Marrow's videos and tests, and strategic test-taking skills for excelling in the [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | INICET exam]].

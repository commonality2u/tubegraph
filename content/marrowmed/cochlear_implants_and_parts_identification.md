A [[cochlear_implant_indications | cochlear implant]] is a device used to help patients with hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Its components can often be identified on imaging such as X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Components of a Cochlear Implant
A [[cochlear_implant_indications | cochlear implant]] system consists of both external and internal devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### External Device
The external device includes:
*   **Microphone:** Picks up sound from the surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Speech Processor:** Converts the picked-up sound into a digital signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Transmitter Coil:** Sends the digital signal across the skin to the internal device via radio frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Internal Device
The internal device consists of:
*   **Receiver Stimulator:** Located just below the skin, it converts the digital signal into electrical impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Electrodes:** These receive the electrical impulses from the receiver stimulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The receiver stimulator and transmitter coil are held in place by magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Intra Electrodes:** These are passed from the mastoid into the [[middle_ear_conditions_and_audiological_tests | middle ear]] through the facial recess, and then from the [[middle_ear_conditions_and_audiological_tests | middle ear]] through the round window, they are placed in the Scala Tympani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
    *   **Ground Electrode (Reference Electrode):** This electrode stays outside the cochlea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Its primary functions are power regulation and regulating the intensity of stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Identifying Components on Imaging
An X-ray of a patient with a bilateral [[cochlear_implant_indications | cochlear implant]] can show various parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. A wire-like structure seen on such an image, which is part of the electrode system but remains external, is identified as the ground electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

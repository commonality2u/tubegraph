This article discusses various imaging signs observed in the Central Nervous System (CNS) that are characteristic of specific neurological conditions, as presented in a radiology discussion from the INIT May 2025 exam.

## Ring Enhancing Lesions in the Brain
[[ring_enhancing_lesions_in_the_brain_and_their_differential_diagnosis | Ring enhancing lesions in the brain and their differential diagnosis]] are characterized by a peripheral enhancing rim of viable tissue and a non-enhancing central portion of non-viable tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. A comprehensive, clinically integrated approach is crucial for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Tuberculomas
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Patients present with signs of infection such as fever, headache, and seizures. There is often a known history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and signs of meningitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** On imaging, diffuse basal enhancing exudates are observed, along with multiple conglomerated ring-enhancing lesions in the brain parenchyma, which are characteristic of tuberculomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

### Neurocysticercosis
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Patients typically present with headache and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** A key imaging sign is a ring-enhancing lesion containing an eccentric dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Cyst with a Dot Sign:** This sign is highly peculiar to neurocysticercosis, where the eccentric dot represents the scolex of the parasite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Escobar Staging of Neurocysticercosis:**
    *   **Vesicular Stage (Acute):** No edema, inflammation, or enhancement, as the body has not yet reacted to the newly formed cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Colloidal Vesicular Stage (Early Subacute):** Characterized by maximum edema, inflammation, and enhancement due to the diffusion of parasitic antigens into the brain parenchyma, eliciting a strong immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Granular Nodular Stage (Late Subacute):** Shows a decreasing trend of edema, inflammation, and enhancement as the immune system acts on the parasitic antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Nodular Calcified Stage (Chronic):** The parasite is killed and phagocytosed, leaving a tiny calcified residue. There is no edema, inflammation, or contrast enhancement at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
*   **Myiocysticercosis:** When cysticercosis affects muscles, it can lead to elongated calcifications visible on X-ray, known as **rice grain calcification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

### Brain Abscess
*   **Clinical Presentation:** A young or middle-aged patient presents with fever, headache, and altered sensorium, typically with an adjacent source of infection (e.g., paranasal sinusitis, chronic ear infections/CSOM) from which the infection spread to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** Ring-enhancing lesions (e.g., in the frontal or temporal lobe depending on the source). A key feature on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is **restricted diffusion**, where the lesion appears bright or hyperintense, indicating the presence of pus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

### Toxoplasmosis
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Seen in HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts, indicating an opportunistic infection. Patients may present with fever, malaise, and headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** Ring-enhancing lesions are typically found within the basal ganglia or at the gray-white matter junctions. They often show a **target sign** or **concentric target sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:21]</a>. Toxoplasmosis is the commonest opportunistic infection affecting the brain in HIV-positive patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

### Glioblastoma (High-Grade Glioma)
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Middle-aged or elderly patients present with seizures and focal deficits, typically without signs of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** Shows an irregular ring-enhancing lesion with a thick peripheral rim of enhancement and central necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Hallmark:** Central area of necrosis is the radiological and histopathological hallmark of a high-grade glioma or glioblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Butterfly Glioma:** Can cross the midline via the corpus callosum, resulting in a butterfly appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

### Metastasis
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Elderly patients with a known primary malignancy (cancer) presenting with seizures and focal deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** Ring-enhancing lesions in the brain are suggestive of the primary tumor spreading to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

## Miscellaneous CNS Imaging Signs

### Hallervorden-Spatz Disease (Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration - PKAN)
*   **Clinical Presentation:** A child (e.g., 12-year-old boy) presenting with rigidity and cognitive impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>.
*   **Imaging Findings:** T2-weighted MRI shows a characteristic **eye of the tiger sign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Eye of the Tiger Sign:** Dark (hypointense) appearing globus pallidus due to iron deposition, with a central bright (hyperintense) area caused by gliosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
    *   This condition is also known as pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

### Arnold-Chiari Malformations
*   **Arnold-Chiari Type 1 Malformation:**
    *   **Imaging Findings:** Characterized by a peg-shaped, elongated cerebellar tonsil herniating down into the cervical spinal canal. This often leads to the formation of a syrinx (syrinx) within the cervical spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Arnold-Chiari Type 2 Malformation:**
    *   **Imaging Findings:** A complex malformation involving a small posterior fossa, a vertical cascade or peg-shaped tapering cerebellar tonsil herniating downwards, dysgenesis or abnormality of the corpus callosum, and ventricular system abnormalities (e.g., dilation, teardrop-shaped ventricles, known as colpocephaly). It is typically associated with open spina bifida in the lumbosacral region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.

### Dandy-Walker Malformation
*   **Imaging Findings:** An abnormality of the posterior fossa characterized by an enlarged fourth ventricle posteriorly, communicating with a large cystic space in the posterior fossa. There is also an upward displacement of the torcula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

### Joubert Syndrome
*   **Imaging Findings:** Presents with a distinctive **molar tooth appearance** of the brainstem and superior cerebellar peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. This appearance is due to an abnormality involving the cerebellar vermis and elongation of the superior cerebellar peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>.

### Schizencephaly
*   **Imaging Findings:** Characterized by a cleft in the brain parenchyma that extends from the surface of the brain directly to the ventricles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>. It can be a "closed-lip" (clefts are close) or "open-lipped" (clefts are widely separated) schizencephaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

### Other Notable CNS Imaging Associations
*   **Wilson's Disease:** Often gives rise to the **face of panda appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:00">[26:34:00]</a>.
*   **Huntington's Chorea:** Characterized by **box car-shaped ventricles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.
*   **Krabbe Disease:** Primarily involves the thalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>.

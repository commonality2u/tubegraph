Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the bones of children, typically appearing in the second decade of life and being more common in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It commonly affects the femoral diaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Patients with Ewing's sarcoma often present with symptoms mimicking an infection, such as fever and pain, and may have a raised ESR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Fever is considered a poor prognostic factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. When a biopsy or aspiration is performed, the contents can appear similar to pus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Radiological Findings

Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by an aggressive periosteal reaction due to its rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Common periosteal reactions include:
*   Lamellated or "onion peel" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   Sunray or Sunburst appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   Codman's triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>

While onion peel is typically associated with Ewing's sarcoma, and Sunburst/Codman's triangle with osteosarcoma, these findings are not pathognomonic or exclusive to one tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Diagnostic Features

The definitive diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma is made through biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
Histopathological findings include:
*   Small round blue cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
*   Pseudorosettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>
*   PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) positive and diastase digestible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
*   CD99 IHC (Immunohistochemistry) positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   Genetic translocation of 11;22 (EWS-FLI1 gene fusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>

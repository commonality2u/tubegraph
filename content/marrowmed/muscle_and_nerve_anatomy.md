## General Embryology and Neural Derivatives

Neural crest derivatives can be remembered using the mnemonic "MORTEL PASS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. These include:
*   Melanocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Odontoblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
*   Trigeminal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
*   Endoneurium cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   Adrenal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>
*   Laryngeal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
*   Parafollicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
*   Pseudounipolar cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   All ganglions (including adrenal medulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   Schwann cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Spiral membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

Additionally, ciliary muscles and the ciliary body are also derived from neural crests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

It is important to note that the retina is not derived from neural crests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The retina and optic nerve are continuations or extensions of the diencephalon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, which itself is derived from the neural tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, originating from neuroectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Histology of Muscles

### Cardiac Muscle
Cardiac muscle can be identified by specific features:
*   Branched myocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>
*   Centrally placed, single nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>
*   Presence of intercalated disks, which are specialized structures between neighboring cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These disks allow for synchronized contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Cranial Nerves and Related Structures

Cranial nerves are critical in [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | functional anatomy relating to cranial nerves and sensory pathways]].
*   The optic canal transmits the optic nerve (second cranial nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   The superior orbital fissure, located between the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid, transmits the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, as well as the ophthalmic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   The oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve) can be identified in some anatomical views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   The sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) has the longest intradural course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> and pierces the dura, passing inside the cavernous sinus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. It also passes inside Dorello's canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   The internal auditory meatus transmits the seventh (facial) and eighth cranial nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   The jugular foramen, located at the junction of the temporal and occipital bones, transmits the ninth (glossopharyngeal), tenth (vagus), and eleventh (accessory) cranial nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. [[Anatomy of the skull and cranial nerves | Jugular foramen syndrome]] (Vernet's syndrome or Lejet syndrome) affects these three nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   The twelfth cranial nerve (hypoglossal nerve) does not pass through the jugular foramen; instead, it passes through the hypoglossal canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Muscles of the Head and Neck

*   **Orbicularis oris:** This muscle is involved in pouting and is also known as the kissing muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   **Zygomaticus major:** This is considered a "laughing muscle" as it helps express a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Buccinator:** This muscle is essential for blowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a> and prevents food accumulation between the cheek and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Damage to the buccinator, such as in facial nerve palsy, can lead to food getting stuck in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

## [[Muscles and nerve innervation of the hand and forearm | Muscles and Nerve Innervation of the Hand and Forearm]]

The [[posterior_interosseous_nerve_injury_and_radial_nerve_anatomy | posterior interosseous nerve injury and radial nerve anatomy]] are important considerations for [[Muscle and nerve innervation in limbs | muscle and nerve innervation in limbs]].
*   The [[posterior_interosseous_nerve_injury_and_radial_nerve_anatomy | posterior interosseous nerve]] innervates all muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, with three exceptions:
    *   Anconeus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>
    *   Brachioradialis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>
    *   Extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>
*   These three muscles are directly supplied by the radial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

### Specific Muscle Actions and Innervation:
*   **Anconeus muscle:** Assists the triceps in elbow extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Brachioradialis:** Although part of the posterior compartment, its alignment causes it to cross the elbow in the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. It is a weak flexor of the elbow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a> and is sometimes referred to as a "shunt muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. It is supplied by the radial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL):** Performs wrist extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

### Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN) Palsy
*   In PIN palsy, extension of the elbow is normal due to the triceps and anconeus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   Wrist extension is also normal due to the ECRL muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, meaning wrist drop is *not* seen in PIN palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   The characteristic deformity in PIN palsy is "finger drop" (loss of extension of the digits), not wrist drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. This affects the [[anatomy_of_digits_and_lumbricals | anatomy of digits and lumbricals]].
*   Supination is performed by the biceps (supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve) and the supinator muscle (supplied by the [[posterior_interosseous_nerve_injury_and_radial_nerve_anatomy | posterior interosseous nerve]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Therefore, supination is largely intact in PIN palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   The [[posterior_interosseous_nerve_injury_and_radial_nerve_anatomy | posterior interosseous nerve]] is a purely motor nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, so there is no sensory loss in PIN palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## Muscles of the Gluteal Region (Lower Limb)

*   The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles are responsible for raising the hip bone of the suspended leg during walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   These muscles are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   Weakness or paralysis of these muscles (due to injury to the muscles or superior gluteal nerve) leads to a positive Trendelenburg sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. This is critical for [[arterial_and_nerve_supply_of_the_leg | arterial and nerve supply of the leg]].

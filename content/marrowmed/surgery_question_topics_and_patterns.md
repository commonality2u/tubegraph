From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The NEET PG 2024 surgery exam featured an equal number of surgery questions in both Session One and Session Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Session Two was generally considered more challenging due to lengthier questions, trickier options, and a greater number of images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Questions were topic-matched between the sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Overall Exam Trends
*   **Surprising Emphasis on Urology**: There was an unexpectedly high number of Urology questions, particularly in Session One, compared to previous exams where Urology typically had only one or two questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Reduced Focus on General Surgery and Trauma**: Both sessions had fewer questions from [[general_surgery_mcq_preparation | general surgery]] and Trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Conceptual and Systemic Focus**: The exam shifted towards more conceptual questions and systemic surgery, requiring an understanding of concepts rather than mere factual recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Shortcuts were not helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Keywords and Clues**: Many questions included sufficient keywords and clues within the stem, allowing candidates to deduce the answer even if uncertain about the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## Frequently Asked Topics

### GI and Hernia
*   **Umbilical Hernia**: A case presenting with an irreducible, inflamed umbilical swelling, requiring management via herniography (suturing the defect) rather than mesh repair due to infection/strangulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>.

Operating on the primary tumor in metastatic breast cancer generally does not improve survival, except in specific oligometastatic cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

### Head and Neck Surgery
*   **Oral Cancer Adjuvant Therapy**: High-risk features for adjuvant radiotherapy include extranodal extension, involved margins, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, multiple involved lymph nodes, and T3/T4 disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. Extranodal extension is considered a major indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cleft Lip and Palate**: The earliest age for cleft lip repair (Miller repair) is 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>. For cleft soft palate, it's typically by 5 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>, and for hard palate, 12 to 15 months (V-Y or von Langenbeck repair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

*   **Oral Ulcerative Lesion**: For chronic tobacco chewers with an ulcerative nodular lesion (e.g., in buccal mucosa), a deep incisional or wedge/edge biopsy (from the edge, not center) is the definitive investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:11:54:00">[3:11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Solitary Thyroid Nodule**: Initial investigation is always thyroid function tests (TFTs) and ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:12:38:00">[3:12:38:00]</a>. If TSH is low, a thyroid scan is done before FNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:13:09:00">[3:13:09:00]</a>.

### Urology
*   **DJ Stent Placement**: Requires a cystoscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:31:12:00">[3:31:12:00]</a>.

Endoscopy shows a "golf hole" ureteric orifice leading to reflux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:38:08:00">[3:38:08:00]</a>. Can lead to "putty kidney" (calcified, non-functioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:39:27:00">[3:39:27:00]</a>.
*   **Kidney Stone Types**: Recurrent renal colic, UTI, and specific crystal appearances in urine analysis are important.
    *   **Cystine stones**: Hexagonal crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:40:09:00">[3:40:09:00]</a>, very hard, radiopaque, difficult to break by ESWL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:40:23:00">[3:40:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Struvite/Triple Phosphate**: Coffin lid appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:40:55:00">[3:40:55:00]</a>, seen with alkaline urine (Proteus infection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:41:06:00">[3:41:06:00]</a>, radiopaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:41:11:00">[3:41:11:00]</a>.

    *   **Primary Tumor**: Partial penectomy for small, distal lesions with >2cm stump and 0.5cm margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:44:00:00">[3:44:00:00]</a>. Total penectomy for large, proximal T3 tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:44:28:00">[3:44:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Lymph Node Management**: Lymph nodes go to inguinal lymph nodes first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:44:53:00">[3:44:53:00]</a>. Most common cause of death is vessel erosion due to involved lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:45:01:00">[3:45:01:00]</a>. If lymph nodes are not enlarged, dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (dual marker) or superficial inguinal clearance is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:45:34:00">[3:45:34:00]</a>. If involved, ilioinguinal lymph node clearance or radiotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:46:23:00">[3:46:23:00]</a>.

Risk factors include Bell Clapper testes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:17:11:00">[3:17:11:00]</a>. Differentiating signs: Prehn's sign (pain reduces in epididymitis, increases in torsion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:18:01:00">[3:18:01:00]</a>, Deming sign (testis lies at a higher level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:18:09:00">[3:18:09:00]</a>, Angel sign (transversely placed testis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:18:37:00">[3:18:37:00]</a>. Salvage rate decreases significantly with delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:18:57:00">[3:18:57:00]</a>. Prophylactic orchidopexy on the contralateral side is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:19:21:00">[3:19:21:00]</a>.
*   **Urethral Stricture**: Acute retention of urine, confirmed by retrograde urethrogram (RGU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:19:43:00">[3:19:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Short incomplete stricture**: Visual internal urethrotomy (VIU/OIU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:20:31:00">[3:20:31:00]</a>.

### General Surgery & Critical Care
*   **Pressure Sores (Bed Sores)**: Always expect images to be Stage Four, showing muscle or bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:12:00">[3:47:12:00]</a>. Most common sites: ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:26:00">[3:47:26:00]</a>. New staging includes:
    *   Stage 1: Non-blanchable erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:44:00">[3:47:44:00]</a>.
    *   Stage 2: Partial thickness skin loss with exposed dermis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:48:00">[3:47:48:00]</a>.
    *   Stage 3: Full thickness skin loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:51:00">[3:47:51:00]</a>.
    *   Stage 4: Full thickness and tissue loss (muscle/bone visible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:47:54:00">[3:47:54:00]</a>.
    *   Prevention involves frequent position changes (10 mins every 2 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:49:16:00">[3:49:16:00]</a> and air/water mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:49:27:00">[3:49:27:00]</a>.
*   **Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) Dressing**: Uses negative pressure (-110 to -125 mmHg) to promote wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:50:46:00">[3:50:46:00]</a>. Uses include chronic non-healing wounds, venous ulcers (debrided), and burns without eschar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:51:11:00">[3:51:11:00]</a>.
*   **Leg Ulcers**:
    *   **Venous ulcers**: Medial malleolus ("gaiter area") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:54:24:00">[3:54:24:00]</a>, shallow with sloping edges, pale granulation tissue, pigmented margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:54:36:00">[3:54:36:00]</a>. Managed with Bisgaard's regime (limb elevation, elastic compression stockings, regular dressings, pentoxifylline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:54:51:00">[3:54:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Arterial ulcers**: Dorsum or lateral side, feeble/absent pulsations, loss of hair/muscle mass, punched-out edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:55:25:00">[3:55:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Neuropathic ulcers**: Typically on the sole (e.g., behind ball of great toe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:56:07:00">[3:56:07:00]</a>, seen in diabetes, decreased sensation, punched-out edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:56:22:00">[3:56:22:00]</a>.

*   **Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Complications**: Most common overall complication is hyperglycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:53:56:00">[3:53:56:00]</a>. Catheter-induced sepsis is the most common central line problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:53:40:00">[3:53:40:00]</a>. Other complications include cholestasis (monitor LFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:54:16:00">[3:54:16:00]</a> and refeeding syndrome (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, with hypophosphatemia as the driver abnormality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:54:44:00">[3:54:44:00]</a>.
*   **Flail Chest**: Defined by fracture of two or more consecutive ribs at two or more sites (ATLS guideline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:56:09:00">[3:56:09:00]</a>. Presents with paradoxical chest wall movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:56:03:00">[3:56:03:00]</a>. The leading cause of death is pulmonary contusion, not the paradoxical movement itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:57:39:00">[3:57:39:00]</a>. Initial management involves oxygen and adequate analgesia (e.g., thoracic epidural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:57:53:00">[3:57:53:00]</a>. If insufficient, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (internal splinting) or surgical fixation may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:58:15:00">[3:58:15:00]</a>.

### Miscellaneous
*   **Skin Graft Survival**: Three phases of graft survival:
    1.  Imbibition (initial absorption of nutrients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:59:46:00">[3:59:46:00]</a>.
    2.  Inosculation (small buds transfer nutrients, Day 2-4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:00:06:00">[3:00:06:00]</a>.
    3.  Neovascularization (new vessel formation, after Day 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:00:31:00">[3:00:31:00]</a>. For postoperative day three, inosculation is the correct mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:00:26:00">[3:00:26:00]</a>.

*   **Aortic Dissection (Stanford Type B)**: Involves only the descending thoracic aorta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:07:56:00">[3:07:56:00]</a>. Initial management involves controlling blood pressure with short-acting beta-blockers like esmolol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:08:40:00">[3:08:40:00]</a> and intensive monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:09:23:00">[3:09:23:00]</a>. Graft repair is done only if there is progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:09:07:00">[3:09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Pheochromocytoma**: Presents with headache, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and increased vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:13:41:00">[3:13:41:00]</a>. The "Rule of 10s" (10% bilateral, 10% malignant, 10% in children, 10% extra-adrenal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:14:33:00">[3:14:33:00]</a>. Associated with MEN 2 syndrome (due to RET proto-oncogene mutation on chromosome 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:15:00:00">[3:15:00:00]</a>.

*   **Nissen Fundoplication**: A complete 360-degree wrap performed for gastroesophageal reflux disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:28:23:00">[3:28:23:00]</a>. The most common complication is gas bloat syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:28:34:00">[3:28:34:00]</a>. Partial wraps include Dor (180° anterior), Toupet (180-270° posterior), and Belsey Mark (270° anterior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:28:53:00">[3:28:53:00]</a>.

### Study Strategy for Future Exams
*   **Develop Strong Concepts**: The shift towards conceptual questions emphasizes the need to understand underlying principles rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:29:17:00">[3:29:17:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Main Videos**: For major subjects, watch main videos to build concepts before focusing on revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:29:52:00">[3:29:52:00]</a>.
*   **Highlight Keywords**: Use a consistent color scheme to highlight keywords in notes to easily recall crucial information for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:39:08:00">[3:39:08:00]</a>.
*   **Review Previous Year Topics**: Topics from previous exams often reappear, though the specific question or angle may differ, as seen with penile cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-3:42:17:00">[3:42:17:00]</a>.

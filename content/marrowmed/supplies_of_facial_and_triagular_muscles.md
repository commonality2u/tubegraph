This article explores the nerve supply and functions of various muscles of the face and those involved in mastication, along with other related muscles in the head and neck. It also touches upon clinical implications of nerve injuries in these regions.

## [[Facial nerve branches and implications of surgery | Facial Nerve Branches and Their Innervation]]

The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland and divides into two main divisions: temporofacial and cervicofacial [01:09:43]. These divisions further branch out to supply various facial muscles.

*   **Temporal Branch**
    *   Mainly supplies the frontalis muscle [01:11:12].
    *   Also supplies the upper part of the orbicularis oculi [01:11:18].
    *   Its action includes raising the eyebrows and wrinkling the forehead, associated with actions like surprise [01:11:24].
    *   Injury can lead to difficulty raising eyebrows [01:11:34].
*   **Zygomatic Branch**
    *   Mainly supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle [01:11:42].
    *   Responsible for the closure of the eye [01:11:50].
    *   Injury can lead to difficulty closing the eye [01:11:52].
*   **Buccal Branch**
    *   Supplies the buccinator muscle [01:12:01].
    *   Supplies the upper lip muscles, including muscles like levator labii superioris, levator anguli oris, and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi [01:12:06].
    *   Also supplies the zygomaticus major and minor muscles [01:12:32].
    *   Injury during parotid surgery can lead to upper lip muscle weakness [01:12:43].
*   **Marginal Mandibular Branch**
    *   Supplies the lower lip muscles [01:12:53].
    *   This includes muscles like depressor anguli oris, depressor labii inferioris, and mentalis [01:12:57].
    *   Injury during parotid surgery can cause lower lip muscle weakness [01:13:17].
*   **Cervical Branch**
    *   Supplies the platysma muscle in the neck [01:13:07].

## [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | Muscles of Mastication and Their Innervation]]

The muscles of mastication are primarily involved in movements of the mandible, such as elevation, depression, protrusion, and retraction. These muscles are innervated by the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | mandibular nerve]], which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve [00:52:44].

### Medial Pterygoid Muscle
*   **Location**: Present on the inner surface of the mandible, in close relation to the palatine tonsil (tonsillar bed) [00:50:57].
*   **Origin**: From the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate [00:05:42].
*   **Insertion**: On the medial surface towards the angle of the mandible [00:05:49].
*   **Actions**:
    *   Elevation of the mandible [00:06:07].
    *   Protrusion of the mandible (helps in protrusion) [00:06:17].
    *   Side-to-side movement (grinding movement) through unilateral action, which deviates the jaw towards the other side [00:06:24].

### Lateral Pterygoid Muscle
*   **Location**: Runs horizontally backward, with two heads (upper and lower) [00:44:26].
*   **Origin**: From the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate [00:44:57].
*   **Insertion**: Converges backward to insert onto the neck of the mandible and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) [00:44:43].
*   **Relationship to Maxillary Artery**: The maxillary artery is divided into three parts by this muscle [00:45:10]. The second part of the maxillary artery runs between its two heads [00:45:25].
*   **Actions**:
    *   Protrusion of the mandible (major muscle for protrusion) [00:46:22].
    *   Depression of the mandible (the only muscle of mastication for depression/jaw opening) [00:46:31].

## [[Muscle and nerve innervation in limbs | Muscles of the Neck Triangles and Associated Innervation]]

The neck is divided into anterior and posterior triangles by the sternocleidomastoid muscle [00:20:17].

### Strap Muscles
*   **Definition**: Midline muscles of the neck located below the hyoid bone [00:15:38]. They are primarily found in the muscular triangle of the neck [00:39:30].
*   **Muscles**:
    *   Sternohyoid muscle (from sternum to hyoid bone) [00:16:28].
    *   Sternothyroid muscle [00:16:31].
    *   Thyrohyoid muscle [00:16:37].
    *   Omohyoid muscle (superior and inferior bellies) [00:16:40].
*   **Innervation**:
    *   Most strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid) are supplied by the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | ansa cervicalis]] (formed by roots from hypoglossal nerve and C2-C3 spinal nerves) [00:15:23].
    *   **Exception**: The thyrohyoid muscle is the only strap muscle directly supplied by the C1 nerve [00:17:26].
*   **Triangle Content**: The muscular triangle contains the omohyoid (superior belly), sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles [00:39:51]. The mylohyoid muscle, which forms the floor of the digastric triangle (submandibular triangle), is not a content of the muscular triangle [00:40:18].

### Spinal Accessory Nerve (Cranial Nerve XI)
*   **Course**: Passes deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then enters the posterior triangle of the neck, supplying the trapezius muscle [00:20:50]. It is superficially placed in the posterior triangle [00:21:05].
*   **Innervation**:
    *   **Sternocleidomastoid**: Supplied by the spinal accessory nerve *before* it enters the posterior triangle [00:21:10].
    *   **Trapezius**: Supplied by the spinal accessory nerve *within* the posterior triangle [00:20:54].
*   **Clinical Implications of Injury**:
    *   **Injury in Posterior Triangle**: The sternocleidomastoid muscle is spared (as it's already innervated), while the trapezius muscle is affected [00:21:38].
        *   **Symptoms**: Difficulty in shrugging shoulders, difficulty in overhead abduction (e.g., combing hair), difficulty in retraction of scapula, and potential winging of the scapula [00:22:18]. Turning the head to the opposite side (sternocleidomastoid function) remains normal [00:21:54].
    *   **Injury in Anterior (Carotid) Triangle**: Both sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles would be affected [00:24:04]. This would result in additional difficulties such as turning the face to the opposite side and tilting the head to the same side (sternocleidomastoid features) [00:24:21].

### Phrenic Nerve
*   **Root Value**: C3, C4, C5 (C4 being the major root) [00:26:41].
*   **Course**: Formed on the lateral border of the scalenus anterior muscle and then descends in front of it [00:26:55].
    *   The right phrenic nerve is shorter and descends vertically, exiting with the inferior vena cava through the caval opening of the diaphragm [00:27:26].
    *   The left phrenic nerve is longer and descends obliquely along the left border of the heart, piercing the muscular part of the diaphragm [00:27:35].
*   **Nature**: It is a mixed nerve [00:28:07].
*   **Innervation**:
    *   **Motor**: Supplies the diaphragm [00:28:01].
    *   **Sensory**: Supplies the diaphragmatic peritoneum, fibrous pericardium, and mediastinal pleura [00:28:12].

## [[Important anatomical structures for surgical procedures | Surgical Implications]]

### Parotid Surgery
*   **Frey's Syndrome**: A complication of parotid surgery characterized by flushing, sweating, and burning sensation on the face during meals [00:00:25].
    *   This is due to injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, which is commonly injured during parotid surgery [00:01:27].
    *   During regeneration, parasympathetic secretomotor fibers of the auriculotemporal nerve (normally supplying the parotid gland) mistakenly fuse with sympathetic fibers of the great auricular nerve (supplying sweat glands in the parotid region) [00:01:47].
    *   The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the posterior division of the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | mandibular nerve]] [00:02:30].

### Submandibular Duct (Wharton's Duct)
*   **Anatomical Relation**: The [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | lingual nerve]] loops around the submandibular duct [01:07:22].
*   **Clinical Relevance**: During incision in the floor of the mouth to remove a stone from the submandibular duct, the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | lingual nerve]] is in danger of being injured [01:07:29].

### Foramen Ovale Lesion
*   **Structures Passing Through Foramen Ovale ("MALE")**:
    *   **M**: [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | Mandibular nerve]] [00:52:25].
    *   **A**: Accessory meningeal artery [00:53:36].
    *   **L**: [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | Lesser petrosal nerve]] (preganglionic parasympathetic to otic ganglion, involved in parotid gland secretion) [00:53:49].
    *   **E**: Emissary vein [00:54:49].
*   **Clinical Implications of Mandibular Nerve Injury**:
    *   Weakness of masticatory muscles [00:52:41].
    *   Weakness of other muscles supplied by the mandibular nerve: tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, mylohyoid, and anterior belly of digastric [00:52:53]. Mylohyoid forms part of the oral diaphragm, so its weakness would affect it [00:55:09].
    *   Loss of secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland (due to lesser petrosal nerve involvement) [00:55:28].
*   **Spared Function**: Upper lip cutaneous innervation (by infraorbital nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve from foramen rotundum) would be spared, as the maxillary nerve does not pass through the foramen ovale [00:55:34].

### Annulus of Zinn (Common Tendinous Ring)
*   **Definition**: A common tendinous ring that divides the superior orbital fissure into three parts: upper, lower, and middle (inside the annulus) [00:57:05].
*   **Nerves Passing Outside the Annulus (Upper Part of Superior Orbital Fissure - "LFT")**:
    *   Lacrimal nerve (branch of ophthalmic nerve) [00:57:53].
    *   Frontal nerve (branch of ophthalmic nerve) [00:58:06].
    *   [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | Trochlear nerve]] (Cranial Nerve IV) [00:58:09].
*   **Nerves Passing Inside the Annulus**:
    *   Upper and lower divisions of the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | oculomotor nerve]] (Cranial Nerve III) [00:58:47].
    *   [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | Abducens nerve]] (Cranial Nerve VI) [00:59:03].
    *   Nasociliary nerve (branch of ophthalmic nerve) [00:59:06].
*   **Clinical Implications of Compression Inside Annulus**:
    *   **Affected Muscles**: Muscles supplied by [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | oculomotor nerve]] (e.g., medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus) and [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | abducens nerve]] (lateral rectus) would be affected [01:00:42].
    *   **Spared Muscle**: The superior oblique muscle, supplied by the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | trochlear nerve]], would be spared because the [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | trochlear nerve]] runs *outside* the annulus of Zinn [01:00:49].

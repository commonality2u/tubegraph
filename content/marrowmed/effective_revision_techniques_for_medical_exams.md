Dr. Tes Dagan, a Radiology Resident at PGI Chandigarh and a former undergraduate student from KEM Mumbai, achieved Rank 8 in the INCT November 2024 exam on his second attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He shares his approach to [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | PG preparation]] and [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | valuable insights]] for success in competitive medical exams.

## Foundational Preparation
Dr. Dagan emphasizes the significance of strong basics from undergraduate studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. He was a studious student from his first year, initially studying from standard textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A solid foundation in first and second-year subjects can significantly cover third and fourth-year material, reducing extra effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Leveraging Marrow Resources

### Role of Main Videos
Dr. Dagan started using Marrow from his third year for third and fourth-year subjects, later integrating content for first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. He used videos for third and fourth-year subjects from scratch, relying on them as his primary knowledge source without additional textbooks for final year exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For first and second-year subjects, where his basics were already strong, he only watched videos for specific topics he wasn't sure about or consistently answered incorrectly in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Certain Marrow videos were particularly impactful:
*   ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

### QBank Strategy
The QBank served as Dr. Dagan's primary preparation resource, more so than the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His approach involved systematically going through every question from the first module to the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

> "What I would do was just go from the starting module first question to the last module last question. I used to make notes or take photos and make folders and I would just revise them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

He found that the QBank effectively covers an entire standard textbook in a question format, including tables and pearls in the explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. These "folders" of QBank material were then revised multiple times, serving as his main source of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This method helps in developing an "art" to solving MCQs, allowing candidates to practice ruling out options and recognize that the answer is usually something known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Test Series (Grand Tests and Subject Tests)
Dr. Dagan started taking Grand Tests (GTs) at the beginning of his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. He also took subject tests as they became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He generally avoided mini-tests due to their negative impact on his anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

His primary focus was on reviewing the tests:
*   Subject tests: Only incorrect answers were reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   Grand tests: Reviewed religiously and entirely, dedicating one full day for the review of each GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

GTs were crucial for benchmarking performance and gaining confidence from consistent good ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. More importantly, GTs helped in identifying weaker subjects, which guided his [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | revision priorities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He advises identifying weaker subjects early in the final year so that internship can be used to focus on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### [[Importance of notetaking and revision techniques in medical studies | Effective Note-Taking]]
Dr. Dagan is not a proponent of handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He relied on:
*   In-video notes provided by Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Printed notes during his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   Most significantly, folders created from the QBank questions and explanations served as his primary notes during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   He transitioned to online reading and PDFs during MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Additional information from Qbanks, GTs, or older GTs was added to these folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Custom Modules
Dr. Dagan was not an "avid user" of custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, he sometimes used them with friends during internship to break the monotony of reading notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. They would create mixed bags of 50-100 questions for general practice and solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## [[Role of Revision in Pathology Exams | Revision Strategy]]

> [!info] Revision is key for retention.

Dr. Dagan's [[effective_revision_tactics_for_medical_exams | revision approach]] focused heavily on revisiting his QBank folders multiple times before exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. For some subjects, he also used revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

For his May attempt, he aimed for two full revisions but managed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In the last month leading up to the exam, he primarily focused on giving tests (around six Grand Tests) rather than extensive revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

> "One good revision along with lot of tests one full revision is enough I think mean in the last okay one full revision and lot of practice test right yeah yeah that's enough the last month." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>

## General Advice for Aspirants
Dr. Dagan offers the following advice for aspiring medical students preparing for exams:
*   **Set Early Targets**: Decide on your desired branch and target early in your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Monitor Performance**: Use GT ranks to gauge your standing and adjust your [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | preparation]] accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Consistency is Key**: Being consistent throughout the preparation period is vital, rather than attempting to cram everything at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Prepare in Advance**: Staying well-prepared in advance and practicing regularly is more beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

His journey underscores the importance of using the right resources, maintaining consistency, and smart practice for achieving success in competitive medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

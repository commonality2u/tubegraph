Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is a critical condition, and its diagnosis is based on specific criteria, primarily applied to children aged 6 months to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Diagnostic Criteria for SAM

The following are included under the diagnostic criteria for SAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) less than 11.5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Presence of bipedal edema (pedal edema on both legs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Weight-for-height below minus three standard deviations (< -3 SD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Important Considerations
*   Only **one** of these criteria needs to be present to make a diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Low height-for-age is indicative of chronic malnutrition, not acute malnutrition, and is therefore not included in the diagnostic criteria for SAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Primary Failure of Treatment in SAM

Primary failure of treatment occurs in the initial stabilization phase of SAM management. It is indicated by the following criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>:
*   Failure to regain appetite by day 4 of treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Failure to start losing edema by day 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Edema still being present (complete absence of edema not achieved) by day 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Failure to gain more than 5 grams per kilogram per day (g/kg/day) by day 10, indicating a failure to enter the rehabilitation phase (Phase Two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Day Zero marks the beginning of treatment, with subsequent days numbered thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Cause of Treatment Failure
The most common reason for a primary failure to respond to SAM treatment is an underlying untreated or unrecognized infection, which should be thoroughly investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

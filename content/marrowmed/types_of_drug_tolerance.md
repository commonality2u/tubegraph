Drug tolerance refers to a phenomenon where the body's response to a drug decreases over time, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Various types of tolerance can develop, influencing drug efficacy and patient management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Acute Tolerance
Acute tolerance is characterized by rapid tolerance development with repeated drug use on a single occasion, such as during a binge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: A patient may suddenly develop tolerance and fail to produce an adequate effect even with high doses of a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Since the patient does not respond to the usual dose, they may increase their intake, which can lead to [[drug_interactions_and_toxicities | toxicity]] or overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Acute tolerance can be observed with substances like alcohol and cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and cannabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Reverse Tolerance
Reverse tolerance is the opposite of typical tolerance, where the response to a drug increases with repeated exposure to the same dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: For example, with cannabis, the drug can be stored in body tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This storage means that less cannabis is needed on subsequent exposures to achieve the same effect because the body already has stored tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Example**: Cannabis is known to exhibit reverse tolerance in some individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Cross Tolerance
Cross tolerance occurs when repeated use of a drug in one category confers tolerance to another drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: If tolerance develops to drug A, it will automatically develop to drug B, particularly if they act on similar pathways or receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Example**: Alcohol acts as a GABA-A receptor modulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Continuous consumption of alcohol leads to tolerance, requiring increased amounts to produce the same effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. If a patient who has developed tolerance to alcohol is prescribed a [[mechanism_of_action_of_specific_pharmaceutical_agents | benzodiazepine]] (e.g., [[mechanism_of_action_of_specific_pharmaceutical_agents | diazepam]]), which is also a GABA-A agonist, they will also exhibit tolerance to the [[mechanism_of_action_of_specific_pharmaceutical_agents | benzodiazepine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. In such cases, higher doses of the second drug might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Dr. Pushwand, who achieved Rank 9 in the NEET PG exam, shares his [[Study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams | study and preparation strategy]] for competitive medical exams, primarily using Marrow as his source of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Core Study Approach

Dr. Pushwand's [[Effective study strategies for medical exams | effective study strategy]] centered around a targeted approach rather than a marathon-style completion of all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

*   **Video Consumption** Instead of watching videos from beginning to end for a subject, he watched videos on specific topics when he needed information or to understand a particular concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Integration with Practical Knowledge** He emphasized clubbing practical knowledge gained from wards or postings with the video content to learn clinically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This approach helped him avoid rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Notes** Dr. Pushwand did not use printed notes; instead, he primarily used handwritten notes or annotated existing notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## MCQ Practice

Recognizing that medical exams are MCQ-based, Dr. Pushwand integrated question practice early in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **Importance of MCQs** He initially thought to master concepts before starting MCQs but soon realized that MCQ practice was equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Daily Target** He aimed to practice at least 50 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Targeted Practice**
    *   **Initial Phase** He focused on topics he had studied 4 days to a week prior to facilitate active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Later Phase** After completing one full reading, he transitioned to random customized modules covering all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules as "Mini GTs"** He found the 50-question customized modules to be effective "mini GTs" (Grand Tests), providing a good idea of his progress without the time commitment of a full GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Feature** He frequently used the bookmark feature for questions but stressed the importance of regularly updating and screening these bookmarks to remove questions he had mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Magic Module** He found Marrow's "magic module" feature particularly useful, although he discovered it later in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand Tests played a crucial role in his [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | preparation strategy]].

*   **Frequency** He initially gave one GT every two weeks, then increased to one GT per week in the last few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Pre-Exam Period** He stopped giving GTs in the last 10 days before the exam, opting instead to focus solely on revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He believed giving GTs too close to the exam could be counterproductive if scores were not good, impacting confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Reviewing GTs** This was a critical component of his [[Effective revision techniques for medical exams | effective revision techniques]].
    *   He used Marrow's filter option to identify incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   He specifically marked questions where he guessed correctly or where he didn't know the concept but derived the answer from options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   His review focused primarily on these "guessed" and incorrect questions, rather than reviewing the entire GT, which he found time-consuming and futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The "guess tracker" feature was very helpful for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Revision Strategy

[[Importance of consistent revision for medical exams | Consistent revision]] was a key element of his [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques for medical exams]].

*   **Planned Revision** He aimed for one solid revision of his important notes, including [[Role of Main Videos and Rapid Revision in Medical Exams | rapid revision]] materials, in the last 1 to 1.5 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Annotated Notes** He used annotated "rapid revision" notes provided by a friend, which he further annotated with important MCQs and new points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Focus on Weak Areas** While he couldn't complete a thorough revision of everything, he focused on important topics where he felt he was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Principle of Important Topics** He adhered to the 80/20 principle, understanding that 80% of questions would likely come from 20% of the topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, guiding his revision focus.

## Time Management During the Exam

Effective time management was crucial during the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

*   **GT Simulation** He made GTs as close to the real exam experience as possible, maintaining discipline like not using a phone or browsing the internet during the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Pacing** He aimed to complete each section of 50 questions with at least seven minutes remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Question Approach**
    *   For questions he didn't know, he limited his thinking time to no more than one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   For lengthy questions, he would read the last line and options first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. If he thought he knew the answer, he would then read the entire question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Mark for Review** Due to changes in rules where "mark for review" questions would not be counted if not submitted, he would always select an answer. If he needed to review it later, he would note it on a paper, ensuring it was submitted even if he ran out of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

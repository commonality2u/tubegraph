The Trendelenburg sign is a crucial concept in understanding the biomechanics of the hip, particularly concerning gait and the function of hip abductor muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This concept, often tested in examinations, involves the dynamic interaction between the supporting and suspended limbs during walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Biomechanics of the Hip and the Trendelenburg Unit

The "Trendelenburg unit" is fundamental to a patient's ability to walk correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Its proper function relies on several components:
*   A proper neck-shaft angle of the femur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   Powerful abductor muscles of the hip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Intact nerve supply to these abductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

During walking, the gait consists of a stance phase and a swing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The limb supporting the body is in the stance phase, while the limb that is suspended and moving forward is in the swing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Key Muscles and Nerve Supply
The primary powerful abductors of the hip are the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. These muscles are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

When standing on one limb (the stance phase limb), the abductor muscles of that supporting leg are responsible for lifting the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This upward lift of the pelvis on the swing side is crucial for proper limb clearance during the swing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Trendelenburg Sign (Gait/Limp)

The Trendelenburg test assesses the abduction capability of the hip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Causes of a Positive Trendelenburg Sign
A positive Trendelenburg sign, resulting in a characteristic gait or limp, occurs due to a failure of the abductor unit of the hip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This can happen if there is:
*   Damage to the superior gluteal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   Injury or weakness to the gluteus medius or minimus muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
When the abductor unit fails on the supporting side, the opposite side of the pelvis (the suspended or "sound" side) will sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. To compensate, the patient will lunge or shift their body weight towards the pathological side (the side with the weakened abductors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This compensatory movement is known as the Trendelenburg gait or limp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Clinical Significance
The Trendelenburg concept is frequently tested with images and theoretical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. It's important to differentiate it from other conditions, as an intertrochanteric fracture (a type of [[proximal_femur_fractures_and_treatment_strategies | proximal femur fracture]]), if it heals in coxa vara (a deformity of the neck-shaft angle), can also lead to a Trendelenburg limp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | Radiological signs]] like coxa vara can indicate a risk of developing this gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

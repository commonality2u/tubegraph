The World Health Organization (WHO) has specific recommendations for the investigation of [[history_of_pulmonary_tuberculosis|spinal tuberculosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. These guidelines prioritize efficient and less invasive diagnostic methods.

## WHO Recommended Investigation

The WHO recommends the Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), also known as Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAT) or GeneXpert test, as the initial approved test for tuberculosis diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This recommendation is aggressively promoted by the WHO because it is less invasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

The GeneXpert test is an automated diagnostic tool that identifies *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. It also detects resistance to rifampicin, a crucial drug in tuberculosis treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. This test simultaneously detects the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex and rifampicin resistance in less than two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Gold Standard vs. WHO Recommendation

While the gold standard investigation for diagnosing [[history_of_pulmonary_tuberculosis|spinal tuberculosis]] is culture of tissue collected from the infection site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, this method involves:
*   MRI of the spine to isolate the lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   CT-guided biopsy of the tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   Sending the tissue for culture and sensitivity testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

The culture method is time-consuming, invasive, and expensive, making it unsuitable as a primary diagnostic test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for growth, and conventional drug resistance testing further adds to the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

The WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis, updated in 2024, explicitly state that for adults and children with signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, Expert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) should be used for detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This nucleic acid amplification test allows for a quick diagnosis of tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

### Radiological Findings in Bone Infections
While [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis|radiological signs]] are helpful, they are often non-specific for definitive diagnosis:
*   **Codman's triangle** and **sunray/sunburst appearance** can occur in various conditions like osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Onion peel appearance** is typically seen in Ewing sarcoma but is non-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Thick or solid periosteal reaction** (involucrum) is characteristic of osteomyelitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

In the context of bone infections like osteomyelitis, a sclerotic bone fragment surrounded by lucencies in the medulla, known as a sequestrum surrounded by involucrum, indicates chronic [[diagnosing_and_managing_bone_infections|osteomyelitis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The most common cause of osteomyelitis is *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Other common causes include *E. coli*, *Streptococcus*, and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. *Klebsiella* is considered an unlikely cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

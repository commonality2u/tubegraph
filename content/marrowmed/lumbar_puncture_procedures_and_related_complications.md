Lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure regularly performed, particularly during spinal anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Indications for Lumbar Puncture

While CT scan is considered the best investigation for diagnosing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, a lumbar puncture is urgently indicated if a CT scan is negative in a suspected case of SAH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Even if the CT scan appears normal, an LP is wise if SAH is still suspected, especially with classical symptoms like a severe thunderclap headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

The reason for this indication is that in SAH, blood accumulation leads to the degradation of blood products into bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This bilirubin circulates through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in a yellow stain called xanthochromia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Xanthochromia indicates the presence of degraded red blood cells in the CSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Safety and Procedure Notes

Lumbar puncture requires utmost precautions and should be treated as a surgical procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Proper care includes:
*   Providing strict aseptic precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   Using chlorhexidine for cleaning the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   Making the area sterile by removing drapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   Wearing masks, caps, and gloves, and washing hands as if performing a surgical procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

Regarding platelet count, a lumbar puncture is safely performed when the patient's platelet count is one lakh (100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Related Complications

### [[post_dural_puncture_headache_and_its_prevalence | Post Dural Puncture Headache]] (PDPH)

[[post_dural_puncture_headache_and_its_prevalence | Post dural puncture headache]] is common in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, particularly young adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, and is not common in older age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It is frequently observed after a cesarean section in young females who experience severe headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

### Meningitis

Meningitis after lumbar puncture is an unusual side effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This complication is largely avoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The incidence of meningitis post-LP has dramatically decreased due to increased awareness that it is a surgical procedure requiring utmost precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

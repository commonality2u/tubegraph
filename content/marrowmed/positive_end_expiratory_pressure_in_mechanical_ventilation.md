Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a key component in mechanical ventilation, designed to maintain positive pressure in the airways at the end of expiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Physiological Basis

Normally, inspiration is an active process where alveoli enlarge, while expiration is a passive process where lung walls come closer due to elastic recoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Although alveoli naturally try to collapse, surfactant in the lungs prevents complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

However, in certain disease conditions, such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), lung compliance is severely affected, leading to alveolar collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Once alveoli collapse, it becomes extremely difficult to open them, which impairs oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Prone positioning, often used in ARDS patients during mechanical ventilation, is relevant here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Mechanism and Purpose of PEEP

PEEP applies a positive pressure at the end of exhalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This positive pressure prevents the alveoli from collapsing, thereby improving the patient's oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The primary significance of PEEP is to prevent alveolar collapse and atelectasis of the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

> "Positive and expiratory pressure that means this expiratory pressure at the time of exhalation when the alveoli are coming closer to each other it will give some positive pressure the moment they are putting positive pressure in this alveoli the alveoli will not collapse and once the alveoli are not collapsing it will try to improve the oxygenation of the patient." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>

PEEP is particularly beneficial in conditions where oxygenation is the main concern, such as ARDS, rather than carbon dioxide problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Carbon dioxide has a high diffusion capacity and will easily escape even with slight alveolar opening, unlike oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## Effects of PEEP

While PEEP significantly improves oxygenation, it can have systemic effects:
*   **Decreased Venous Return:** Positive intrathoracic pressure, which occurs with PEEP, decreases the siphoning effect that normally pulls blood into the heart during negative pressure breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This leads to a decrease in venous return, and consequently, a reduction in preload and cardiac output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Barotrauma:** Excessive positive pressure can lead to barotrauma, especially in fragile lungs like those of pediatric patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Manual resuscitators (like Ambu bags, also known as self-inflating manual resuscitators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>) often include a "pop-off valve" or "pressure relief valve" to prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. This valve typically opens at 30-40 cm of water pressure in pediatric bags, and can open up to 60 cm of water in adult bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. Normal airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation is typically 10-20 cm of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

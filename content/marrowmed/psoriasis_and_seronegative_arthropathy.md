Psoriasis is categorized as a [[papulosquamous_disorders | papulosquamous disorder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Psoriatic arthropathy is identified as an example of seronegative arthropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The term "seronegative arthropathy" signifies the absence of specific autoantibodies in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Distinguishing Features of Psoriatic Arthropathy

While diarrhea does not distinguish psoriatic arthropathy from other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, key features that help differentiate it include:
*   **Dactylitis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   **Enthesitis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **Nail dystrophy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>

### Clinical Manifestations

*   **Dactylitis**: Characterized by uniform inflammation and swelling of a digit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Enthesitis**: Defined as inflammation occurring at the attachment sites of a tendon, ligament, or fascia to the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Nail Dystrophy**: Typical nail changes in psoriasis include:
    *   Nail pitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
    *   Subungual hyperkeratosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
    *   Distal onycholysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

## CASPAR Criteria for Psoriatic Arthropathy

The CASPAR (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) criteria are used for classifying psoriatic arthropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. To meet the CASPAR criteria, there must be an established inflammatory articular disease (an entry or major criterion) along with a score of three points from the minor criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Major Criterion
*   Established inflammatory articular disease, which can manifest as peripheral arthritis (joint involvement), axial arthritis (spine involvement), or enthesitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Minor Criteria (A score of 3 is required)
*   **Evidence of Psoriasis**:
    *   Current psoriasis: 2 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    *   Personal history of psoriasis: 1 point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   Family history of psoriasis: 1 point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   **Typical Nail Psoriatic Dystrophy**: 1 point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Dactylitis**: 1 point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   **Negative Test for Rheumatoid Factor**: 1 point, indicating its status as a seronegative arthropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Radiographic Evidence of Juxta-articular New Bone Formation**: 1 point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

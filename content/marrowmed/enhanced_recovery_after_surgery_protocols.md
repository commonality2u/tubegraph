Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) refers to a collection of protocols implemented before, during, and after surgery to facilitate faster patient recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These protocols are considered very important for surgical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Key Principles and Components

ERAS protocols aim to reduce the surgical stress response, optimize physiological function, and promote early discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Pre-operative Phase
*   **Patient Counseling**: Patients should be thoroughly counseled regarding the ERAS pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bowel Preparation**: Mechanical bowel preparation is generally avoided as it can worsen fluid and electrolyte imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Fasting Guidelines**: Solids can be consumed up to 6 hours before surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, and carbohydrate-rich clear liquids can be given up to 2 hours prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Intra-operative Phase
*   **Surgical Technique**: Minimally invasive techniques are preferred to enable faster recovery and reduce pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Anesthesia**: Long-acting local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, should be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Temperature Management**: Maintaining patient warmth is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Fluid Management**: Maintenance intravenous (IV) fluids are administered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) Prevention**: At least two classes of antiemetic drugs should be used to prevent nausea and vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Post-operative Phase
*   **Pain Management**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used. Opioids are reserved for breakthrough pain only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Diet Progression**: A regular diet should be initiated promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Fluid Discontinuation**: Intravenous fluids are typically discontinued within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Early Ambulation**: Patients should be encouraged to ambulate within 24 hours of surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Drainage**: ERAS protocols recommend inserting fewer drains to facilitate easier patient discharge and self-management at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It is incorrect to insert drains specifically for output monitoring if early discharge is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   [[nutritional_support_in_surgical_patients | Nutritional support]] strategies like improving nutrient intake for at least two weeks before surgery can improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   Bathing with antiseptic soap solution before surgery helps reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   Smoking cessation is most beneficial if done at least 6 to 8 weeks prior to surgery, with 4 weeks alone being insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or dizziness, often accompanied by other symptoms. Differentiating between various causes of vertigo is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

## Common Symptoms Associated with Vertigo

Vomiting and nausea are common symptoms that can accompany any severe vertigo, whether it is due to a peripheral or central vestibular pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This is because the vestibular system has interconnections with the reticular formation and the autonomic nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Stimulation of the autonomic nervous system due to severe vertigo can lead to symptoms like vomiting, nausea, palpitations, and sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Specific Conditions and Their Vertigo Characteristics

### Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)

*   **Typical Presentation**: BPPV presents with episodic vertigo triggered by posture changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Case Example**: A 52-year-old male experiencing vomiting and rotational vertigo upon turning in bed in the morning is highly indicative of BPPV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Meniere's Disease

*   **Vertigo Characteristics**: Vertigo in Meniere's disease is continuous, lasting from 20 minutes to 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. It does not typically occur due to posture changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Associated Symptoms**: Vomiting can be present in Meniere's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### [[vestibular_neuritis_and_head_impulse_test | Vestibular Neuritis]]

*   **Vertigo Characteristics**: [[vestibular_neuritis_and_head_impulse_test | Vestibular neuritis]], an inflammation of the vestibular nerve, causes continuous vertigo that typically lasts at least three to seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Vertigo is not induced by posture change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Associated Symptoms**: The vertigo in [[vestibular_neuritis_and_head_impulse_test | vestibular neuritis]] is very severe and often accompanied by vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Labyrinthitis

*   **Vertigo Characteristics**: Labyrinthitis, an inflammation of the labyrinth, results in continuous vertigo that persists for a few days, potentially extending to weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. It does not typically occur due to posture change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Associated Symptoms**: Vomiting can be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

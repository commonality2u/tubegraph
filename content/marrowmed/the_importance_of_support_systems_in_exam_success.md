## The Crucial Role of Support Systems

Dr. Dhan Kandelval emphasized that success in such exams is not solely an individual endeavor, but rather "requires an entire set of family, friends along with the individual effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Dr. Shloka herself affirmed this, stating, "I couldn't have achieved this alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Family as a Pillar of Strength

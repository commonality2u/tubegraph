The introduction of the section-wise format in [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | Grand Tests]] (GTs) has altered the approach to solving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It changes "the game of solving GTs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, requiring a period of adaptation to become proficient.

To effectively navigate this new format and subsequently [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | improve your score]], it is estimated to take five to ten [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | GTs]] just to understand its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the transcript does not explicitly list benefits *of* the section-wise format itself, it implies that mastering this specific format is crucial for subsequent score improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the [[importance_of_giving_gts_early | importance of starting GTs early]] due to the new format, rather than waiting for syllabus completion, as a syllabus is rarely truly finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Starting early, even without full syllabus coverage, can help develop:
*   **Enhanced Guessing Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Divergent Thinking** to arrive at the correct option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Inter-subject Application** to fill knowledge gaps in specific subject questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

Therefore, it is advised to engage with [[effective_utilization_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | GTs]] as early as possible to become accustomed to the section-wise format and develop these critical problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

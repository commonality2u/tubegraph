Dr. Pushwand, who achieved rank nine in the INICET exam, shares insights into his preparation strategies, particularly focusing on effective [[time_management_and_testtaking_techniques | time management]] during exams and mock tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Simulating Exam Conditions
To prepare for the actual exam, Dr. Pushwand emphasized making Grand Tests (GTs) as realistic as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This involved:
*   Being strict with time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   Avoiding distractions like phones or browsing the internet during the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Habituating oneself to the exam environment, including the frustration of sitting for three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Efficient Question Approach
During the exam, Dr. Pushwand employed specific [[problemsolving_strategies_in_exams | strategies]] to manage his time effectively:
*   **Time per question** If he didn't know the answer to a question, he would not spend more than one minute thinking about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Lengthy questions** For longer questions, he would always read the last line first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. If he thought he knew the answer, he would then read the entire question and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Mark for review** Due to rule changes where "mark for review" questions might not be counted if time runs out, he avoided using this feature for final answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Instead, he would commit to an answer but note it on paper, reviewing it only if time permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This ensures the answer is submitted even if he couldn't revisit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Review Strategy
Reviewing GTs efficiently is crucial for [[time_management_and_testtaking_techniques | time management]] and effective learning:
*   **Targeted review** Dr. Pushwand utilized Marrow's filter option to focus on incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **"Guess" marking** He specifically marked questions where he guessed correctly or arrived at the answer without fully knowing the concept, often by process of elimination from options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Optimizing review time** He stopped reviewing the entire GT, as it was too time-consuming (taking an extra 3 hours) and futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Instead, he focused on the "guessed" questions and the incorrect ones, as these were the most essential areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The "guess tracker" feature was particularly useful for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Practice and Revision
*   **Daily MCQ practice** After realizing the importance of MCQs, he aimed for at least 50 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Initially, these were from topics studied a few days or a week prior for active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Later, he used random customized modules covering all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The 50-question custom module acted like a "mini GT," providing daily mock test experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Bookmark management** He frequently used bookmarks for questions but realized the need to update and screen them, removing questions he had mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Grand test frequency** He started giving GTs once every two weeks, then weekly in the last few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, he stopped giving any GTs in the final 10 days before the exam, opting to focus on revision instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This was to avoid potential confidence drops from poor scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Last-minute revision** His revision plan involved a solid review of important notes, which he annotated from a friend's notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He focused on important topics and those where he felt lacking, aligning with the "80% of questions from 20% of topics" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He recognized that the exam often repeats concepts in different ways or in depth, rather than covering diverse new topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

This article summarizes key biochemistry concepts, particularly focusing on [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | metabolic disorders]] and [[enzyme_deficiencies_and_their_biochemical_implications | enzyme deficiencies]], as discussed in a May 2025 biochemistry recall session. The session highlighted the moderate to difficult nature of the exam, with a significant portion of questions (around 15 total) coming from biochemistry [00:00:20]. Genetics, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and proteins were frequently covered topics, alongside one question on acid-base balance [00:00:30]. Only one direct repeat question from previous years was observed, concerning Kori's disease, but 9 to 10 questions were from previous year topics [00:00:47]. New questions included topics like "Eye of the Tiger sign," "gene pool," "surface plasmon resonance," and "strain typing" [00:01:07].

## Sphingolipidosis

Sphingolipidosis are [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | metabolic disorders]] characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids due to [[enzyme_deficiencies_and_their_biochemical_implications | enzyme deficiencies]] [00:01:49]. A key diagnostic clue for some sphingolipidosis is the presence of a cherry red spot [00:01:55].

### Diagnostic Approach to Sphingolipidosis

An algorithm to diagnose sphingolipidosis based on clinical findings involves:
*   **Cherry Red Spot:**
    *   **Present:** Next, check for visceromegaly [00:02:42].
        *   **Visceromegaly Absent:** [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Tay-Sachs disease]] (GM2 gangliosidosis) or metachromatic leukodystrophy [00:02:55]. Krabbe's disease may sometimes present with a cherry red spot, but visceromegaly is absent [00:03:12].
        *   **Visceromegaly Present:** Niemann-Pick disease or GM1 gangliosidosis [00:03:18].
    *   **Absent:** Confined to [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Gaucher's disease]] and Fabry's disease [00:03:32].
        *   **Massive Visceromegaly Present:** [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Gaucher's disease]] [00:03:58].
        *   **Other clues (e.g., maltese cross appearance, angiofibromas):** Fabry's disease [00:04:08].
*   **Mental Retardation:** If mental retardation is absent, it points towards [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Gaucher's disease]] and Fabry's disease [00:04:44].

### Case Example: 4-year-old child with Developmental Regression, Hepatosplenomegaly, and Cherry Red Spot

This presentation, specifically with a cherry red spot and hepatosplenomegaly, points to Niemann-Pick disease or GM1 gangliosidosis [00:05:05].
*   **Hexosaminidase A deficiency** is associated with [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Tay-Sachs disease]], which does not have visceromegaly [00:05:38].
*   **Sphingomyelinase deficiency** is associated with Niemann-Pick disease, which fits the clinical picture [00:05:51].
*   **Arylsulfatase A deficiency** causes metachromatic leukodystrophy, which also lacks visceromegaly [00:05:57].
*   **Glucocerebrosidase deficiency** causes [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Gaucher's disease]], which presents with visceromegaly but typically *lacks* a cherry red spot [00:06:04].

Therefore, the deficient enzyme is sphingomyelinase, indicating Niemann-Pick disease [00:05:51].

## Glycogen Storage Disorder: Kori's Disease

A neonate presenting with liver disease, muscle weakness at 4 months, severe fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, ketosis, acidosis, and increased ALT/AST, particularly with a normal rise in blood glucose after an IV glucagon challenge following a carbohydrate meal, points towards [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Kori's disease]] [00:09:00].

### Distinguishing Kori's Disease from Von Gierke's Disease

*   **Shared Features:** Fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly are common to many [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | glycogen storage disorders]] [00:10:28].
*   **Features favoring Kori's Disease:** Increased liver enzymes [00:10:38].
*   **Features sometimes misleading to Von Gierke's (Type 1):** Ketosis is a biochemical hallmark of Type 1 Von Gierke's disease, though it may or may not be present in Type 3 (Kori's) [00:10:00]. If "normal glycogen" is mentioned, it might lean towards Von Gierke's, whereas "abnormal glycogen" points to Kori's [00:11:10].
*   **IV Glucagon Challenge:** This is the most crucial diagnostic test [00:11:53].
    *   **In Von Gierke's disease (Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency):** Administering glucagon will *not* lead to a rise in blood glucose because the final enzyme (glucose-6-phosphatase) is deficient, preventing glucose release [00:13:02].
    *   **In Kori's disease (Debranching enzyme deficiency):** Glucagon *will* cause a rise in blood glucose. Although the debranching enzyme (alpha-1,4/1,4 glucan transferase) is defective, glycogen phosphorylase can still release glucose-1-phosphate from the non-branched portions of glycogen until the branching points are reached. This glucose-1-phosphate can then be converted to glucose [00:13:18].

Therefore, the normal rise in blood glucose after an IV glucagon challenge indicates a debranching [[enzyme_deficiencies_and_their_biochemical_implications | enzyme deficiency]], characteristic of [[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | Kori's disease]] [00:13:45]. This was identified as a direct repeat question from previous exams [00:13:51].

## Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency

In G6PD deficiency, there is a decreased level of NADPH, which promotes hemolysis [00:22:20]. This leads to hemolytic jaundice [00:22:38].
*   **Bilirubin Findings:** Indirect bilirubin is increased, while direct bilirubin remains normal [00:22:48].
*   **Urine Urobilinogen:** Excess hemolysis leads to increased urobilinogen production, so urine urobilinogen is increased (positive Ehrlich's test) [00:22:57].

## Enzymes and Metabolism in Weight Gain

For an obese individual on a high carbohydrate diet, several [[enzyme_deficiencies and their biochemical implications | enzymes]] and processes are prominent in weight gain [00:16:33].
*   **High Carbohydrate Intake:** Leads to excess glucose [00:16:55].
*   **Glycolysis and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase:** Glucose undergoes glycolysis to pyruvate. Excess glucose is channeled through pyruvate dehydrogenase into acetyl coenzyme A, an irreversible step, preventing conversion back to glucose [00:17:05]. If provided as an option, pyruvate dehydrogenase would be a strong candidate for the "most prominent enzyme" due to this critical diversion [00:21:22].
*   **Citrate Transport:** Acetyl coenzyme A, formed in the mitochondria, is transported to the cytoplasm as citrate via the tricarboxylic acid transporter to facilitate fatty acid synthesis [00:17:36].
*   **Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC):** In the cytoplasm, acetyl coenzyme A is converted to malonyl coenzyme A by acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. ACC is the *rate-limiting enzyme* of fatty acid synthesis [00:18:38]. If a single-best answer was required, ACC would be the primary choice if pyruvate dehydrogenase was not available [00:20:47].
*   **Malonyl CoA:** This molecule plays a dual role:
    1.  It is a substrate for fatty acid synthesis, leading to storage as triacylglycerol [00:18:27].
    2.  It inhibits Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the gateway enzyme for beta-oxidation (fatty acid oxidation), thus preventing fat breakdown [00:19:05].

Therefore, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, malonyl coenzyme A (product), and tricarboxylic acid transporter all play significant roles in weight gain from a high carbohydrate diet [00:19:26]. Mitochondrial carnitine (likely referring to CPT1, which is inhibited) is not directly responsible for weight gain [00:19:33].

## Cancer Cell Metabolism: The Warburg Effect

Cancer cells consume significantly more glucose than normal cells [00:26:47]. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect.
*   **Aerobic Glycolysis:** Cancer cells convert glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen and intact mitochondria [00:27:00].
*   **ATP Deficiency:** This reliance on aerobic glycolysis yields only two ATPs per glucose molecule, leading to an increased demand for glucose to meet energy needs [00:27:20].
*   **Metabolic Reprogramming:** The exact reason for this shift is "metabolic reprogramming," involving the presence of a specific isoform of pyruvate kinase called PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), instead of the usual PKM1 found in most adult tissues [00:28:48].

Thus, the increased lactate production, even in the presence of oxygen, is the primary process responsible for the high glucose consumption by cancer cells [00:27:56].

## Other Relevant Biochemical Concepts

### Gene Pool
The "gene pool" refers to the combination of all genes, including all alleles, present in a reproducing population or species [00:07:41]. This broad scope is essential to guarantee genetic diversity, unlike a gene pool from a family, individual, or tissue, which would have less diversity [00:07:01].

### Molecular Biology Techniques
*   **Southern Blotting (N.R.S.D.W.P.):** This technique is used for DNA hybridization. The acronym "N.R.S.D.W.P." is a mnemonic related to Northern, Southern, Western, and Eastern blotting [00:08:43]. Specifically, "S" is for Southern blotting, "N" for Northern, "W" for Western, and "P" for Protein [00:08:48].
*   **Genetic Testing for Cancer (BRCA1/2):** For detecting mutations like point mutations or small mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, the best genetic test is next-generation sequencing, including whole exome sequencing [00:29:20].
    *   **qPCR (Quantitative PCR/Real-time PCR):** Used when mutations affect gene length or dosage (e.g., trinucleotide repeat expansions, large gene deletions) [00:31:01].
    *   **RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR):** Detects RNA levels and is used for gene expression studies, not DNA mutation detection [00:32:02].
    *   **Whole Exome Sequencing:** A cost-effective alternative to whole genome sequencing that only sequences the coding regions (exons) of the genome to identify mutations [00:33:02].

### Glycine Titration Curve and Isoelectric Point (pI)
The pH at which a compound exists as a zwitterion or ampholyte is its isoelectric point (pI) [00:24:01]. For simple amino acids like glycine, pI is calculated as the average of its two ionization constants (PK1 and PK2) [00:24:15]. For glycine with PK1 = 2.4 and PK2 = 9.8, the pI is (2.4 + 9.8) / 2 = 6.1 [00:24:41]. For amino acids with three ionizable groups (e.g., aspartic acid), pI is the average of the ionization constants of the isoionic species (e.g., PK2 and PK3 for aspartic acid, excluding the positively charged alpha-amino group) [00:25:48].

### Cyanide and Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Both cyanide and carbon monoxide act as inhibitors of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the electron transport chain [00:26:31].

### Insulin-Dependent Glucose Transporters
In uncontrolled diabetes, there is decreased glucose uptake in cells that rely on insulin-dependent glucose transporters [00:35:07]. These transporters are primarily found in the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue [00:35:31]. Therefore, skeletal muscle would show decreased glucose uptake [00:35:47].

### Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Strain Identification
Identifying different mutated strains of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* involves techniques that analyze DNA sequences [00:36:02]. These methods include:
*   **Chromosome Mutation Analysis:** A general term for techniques detecting changes in chromosomal DNA [00:37:00].
*   **RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism):** An older but still popular technique that identifies strains based on unique restriction sites recognized by restriction enzymes [00:37:05].
*   **Spoligotyping:** Targets unique spacer sequences located on either side of direct repeats within the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genome [00:37:46].
*   **MIRU-VNTR (Multiple Interspersed Repetitive Unit - Variable Number Tandem Repeat) Typing:** A more advanced technique that directly types variable number tandem repeats, offering higher discriminatory quality than spoligotyping [00:38:31].
*   **Next Generation Sequencing (e.g., Whole Genome Sequencing):** Considered the definitive method for genotyping bacterial strains, providing comprehensive genetic information [00:39:17].

### Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a technique used to study molecular interactions in real-time and without the need for labels [00:41:10]. It is used to detect the association and dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes by measuring changes in a surface plasmon resonance angle when these complexes form [00:41:51]. SPR is considered a gold standard method for detecting antibody affinity [00:43:45]. Unlike ELISA, SPR is a label-free technique and provides real-time measurements [00:44:53].

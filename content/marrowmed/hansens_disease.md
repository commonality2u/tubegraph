[[Hansen's Disease]] is a chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae*, primarily affecting the skin and peripheral nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Nerve involvement is a crucial characteristic of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Common presentations include:
*   Slight loss of sensation along the ulnar nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   Solitary nodules on the forearm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   Skin lesions, which can vary depending on the type of [[Hansen's Disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Types of Hansen's Disease
### Tuberculoid Leprosy
In tuberculoid leprosy, the patient's cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Histopathology**: Shows a densely packed granuloma, also known as a tuberculoid granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This includes few giant cells and many lymphocytes, indicating robust patient immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Lepromin Test**: The [[Lepromin test]] will be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### Lepromatous Leprosy
In contrast, [[lepromatous leprosy]] would typically show a diffuse collection of foamy macrophages without a well-defined granuloma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The cell-mediated immunity is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, leading to a negative [[Lepromin test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Diagnostic Investigations
### Lepromin Test
The [[Lepromin test]] is an intradermal Type IV hypersensitivity reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. It is directly proportional to a patient's cell-mediated immunity (CMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. A high CMI results in a positive [[Lepromin test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, while a low CMI results in a negative [[Lepromin test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Histopathology
Biopsies reveal characteristic patterns. For instance, tuberculoid leprosy presents with densely packed granulomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Complications: Trophic Ulcer
A common complication of [[Hansen's Disease]] is the trophic ulcer, also known as a neuropathic ulcer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Description**: A well-demarcated, non-tender ulcer on the foot with hyperkeratotic borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. The hyperkeratotic borders provide mechanical protection but can impede blood circulation and delay wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Pathophysiology**: These ulcers result from peripheral neuropathy, which leads to a loss of protective pain sensation in the affected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. The inability to detect minor trauma results in repeated unnoticed injuries, predisposing the patient to trophic ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Definition**: A trophic ulcer is a chronic ulcer of an anesthetic foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

### Management of Trophic Ulcer
Key principles for managing trophic ulcers include:
1.  **Rest and Leg Elevation**: To reduce swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
2.  **Offloading Devices**: Such as non-weight-bearing splints, to shift pressure away from the ulcerated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
3.  **Appropriate Footwear**: Use microcellular rubber footwear for better pressure distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
4.  **Adequate Food Care**: Essential for wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

## National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP)
The National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP) uses specific emblems and mascots to promote awareness and community participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

### NLEP Emblem
The NLEP emblem symbolizes hope and positive action towards the eradication of [[leprosy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Lotus**: Signifies beauty and purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Partially Affected Thumb**: Represents that [[leprosy]] can be cured and that a patient can be a useful member of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Rising Sun**: Symbolizes hope and optimism for the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Sapna Mascot
Sapna is the mascot for NLEP, representing a local girl child designed to spread awareness about the [[leprosy]] program in the community and promote community participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. Her key tag is "so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

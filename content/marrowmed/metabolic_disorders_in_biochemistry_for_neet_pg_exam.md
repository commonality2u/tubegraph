## Overview of Biochemistry Questions in NEET PG 2024

The biochemistry questions in the NEET PG 2024 exam were predominantly scenario-based structured MCQs of moderate length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Direct repeats from previous years were almost nil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. All questions focused on [[key_subject_areas_and_highyield_topics_for_neet_pg_medicine_section | high-yielding topics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For biochemistry, the main high-yielding areas are [[metabolic_disorders_and_enzymes | metabolic disorders]] (especially those associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism) and vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Although the topics might seem easy, the questions were often tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Both Session 1 and Session 2 of the exam had comparable difficulty levels, with only one or two very difficult questions per session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Key Metabolic Disorders Examined

### Homocystinuria

A patient with ectopia lentis and no megaloblastic anemia, found to have low methionine levels, is indicative of Homocystinuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

#### Classic Homocystinuria
*   **Defect**: Cystathionine beta synthase enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Vitamin Requirement**: B6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Biochemical Findings**: Reduced cysteine levels, normal methionine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Anemia**: Megaloblastic anemia is **not** seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Cysteine supplementation and high dose of B6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

#### Non-Classic Homocystinuria
*   **General Finding**: Low methionine level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Cysteine levels are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Causes**:
    1.  **Defect in N5-methyl-THF formation**: Due to Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

This is usually the cause of toxic symptoms like poor oral intake and lethargy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
    2.  UDP-glucose 4-epimerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
    3.  Galactokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Galactokinase deficiency typically presents with cataract as the sole manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

### Wilson's Disease

Symptoms such as choreoid movements, dysarthria, and dystonia, combined with the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring (present in 99% of cases), point to Wilson's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

*   **Biochemical Defect**: Mutation in the ATP7B gene in the liver, affecting copper transporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This leads to copper accumulation in the liver and spilling into systemic circulation, causing copper toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

### Hyperlipoproteinemias

These are classified based on the elevated lipid: hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. Frederickson classification types 1, 4, and 5 involve hypertriglyceridemia, while type 2 involves hypercholesterolemia, and type 3 involves both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.

#### Type 1 Hypertriglyceridemia
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, with serum triglycerides around 2000 mg/dL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. Severe abdominal pain is due to pancreatitis caused by the high triglyceride burden on the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Deficient Apolipoprotein/Enzyme**:
    *   Lipoprotein lipase deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This enzyme converts mature chylomicrons and VLDL to remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
    *   Apo C2 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. Apo C2 activates lipoprotein lipase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Result**: Accumulation of chylomicrons and VLDL, leading to very high triglyceride levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

#### Type 2 (Familial) Hypercholesterolemia
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Family history of coronary artery disease, tendon xanthomas (especially Achilles tendon), and yellowish raised spots on eyelids (xanthelasma palpebrarum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. High serum LDL and elevated cholesterol levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Biochemical Defect**:
    *   LDL receptor defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. This impairs the uptake of LDL by its receptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.
    *   Apo B100 defect, as Apo B100 is the ligand for LDL receptor uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Associated Conditions**: Increased risk of coronary artery disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>, and corneal arcus (especially in patients younger than 45 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

### Carnitine Deficiency

Fatigue, muscle weakness on exercising, affected long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation, and fat vacuoles in muscle biopsy point to carnitine deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

*   **Role of Carnitine**: Transports LCFAs into the mitochondria for oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Impaired fatty acid oxidation leads to muscle metabolism issues, causing fatigue and weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

### Pompe's Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II)

A 3-month-old child with hypotonia, floppiness, difficulty feeding, failure to thrive, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly on X-ray is indicative of Pompe's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:58">[01:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.

*   **Classification**: A lysosomal storage disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features**: While cardiomegaly, hypotonia, and macroglossia are key, hepatomegaly can also be seen in Pompe's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

### Lactose Intolerance

A child experiencing recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea after ingesting a milk-based product is likely suffering from lactose intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

*   **Deficient Enzyme**: Lactase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.
*   **Types**: Can be hereditary or acquired (e.g., due to withdrawal from milk-based diets, as lactase is an inducible enzyme) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

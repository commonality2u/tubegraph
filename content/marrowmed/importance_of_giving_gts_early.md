Starting Grand Tests (GTs) early in your preparation journey is highly beneficial, as it offers several advantages over waiting for syllabus completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Understanding the GT Format
It takes a significant number of GTs—typically 5 to 10—to fully grasp the "game" of solving them, especially with the current [[benefits_of_sectionwise_format_in_gts | section-wise format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only after this initial period of familiarization can one begin to truly [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | improve their score]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Myth of Syllabus Completion
A common misconception is to delay taking GTs until the entire syllabus is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, it's often the case that a syllabus can never truly be "completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Waiting for this elusive goal is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Benefits of Starting Early
[[starting_early_with_pg_exam_preparation | Starting early]] with GTs, even without having covered all subjects, provides a distinct advantage:
*   **Developing Guessing Power** It helps in developing a good guessing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Thinking** It encourages thinking differently to arrive at the correct option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Application** It teaches you to use knowledge from other subjects to fill gaps when facing questions about unfamiliar topics within a specific subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Real Exam Simulation** In competitive exams like I-Set, it's rare to know every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Giving GTs early prepares you for this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Therefore, it is advisable to give GTs as early as possible in your preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

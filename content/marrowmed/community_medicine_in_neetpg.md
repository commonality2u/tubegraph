Community Medicine played a significant role in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG) 2024 examination. The exam, conducted in two sessions, featured questions from similar chapters and topics across both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Each session included approximately 20-21 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Scenario:** Which of the following is true about Longevity Dividend? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>
*   **Discussion:** Longevity dividend is closely related to demographic dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. Demographic dividend refers to a higher number of economically productive population due to high birth rates in previous stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. This leads to more money, which in turn increases lifespan (longevity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. The benefit of increased longevity is economic and health benefits for society as people live longer and contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

    *   MMR = (4 / 4,000) x 100,000 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

    (Followed by Preparedness and Strategy Planning, leading back to potential disaster) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.
*   **Best Answer:** Disaster Impact -> Disaster Response -> Rehabilitation -> Mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

### Air Requirement Parameter

    *   The best prophylaxis for TB is always 6 months of Isoniazid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.
    *   For Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV), the prophylaxis of choice is 6 months of Isoniazid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
    *   Compliance is generally better for shorter regimens (like 3HP) than longer ones (like 6 months or 9 months Isoniazid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
    *   There is no significant difference in efficacy between 3HP and 6H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>.
    *   TB regimens are not related to abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

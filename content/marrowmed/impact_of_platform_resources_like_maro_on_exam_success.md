Dr. Vinit achieved an excellent rank of seven in the recently conducted INI CET exam [00:00:15]. His success is attributed to diligent preparation and effectively utilizing available opportunities [00:00:21]. Dr. Mayur Kulkarni, a radiology faculty member on [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]], hosted an interview with Dr. Vinit and his proud parents to discuss his journey [00:00:02].

## Dr. Vinit's Background and Preparation Habits

Dr. Vinit is an intern from Mumbai, born and brought up there, and attends a private medical college [00:04:29]. This was his first attempt at the INI CET exam [00:04:29, 00:04:38]. His parents observed his focused and consistent study habits, often spending most of his time in his room following a schedule for tests, exams, and watching videos [00:01:14, 00:01:59]. Even during his internship, he was frequently solving questions on his phone [00:02:15, 00:02:18].

## Early Engagement with Marrow

Dr. Vinit's [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] preparation began in his second year of medical school [00:04:49, 00:05:54]. After reading standard textbooks in his first and half of his second year, he acquired a [[marrow_subscription_and_its_impact_on_exam_preparation | Marrow subscription]] [00:05:12, 00:05:17, 00:05:19]. He initially used it to study ENT by watching the [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | ENT video]] [00:05:21, 00:05:24]. He continued to use [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] throughout his third and final years, primarily focusing on the notes [00:05:27, 00:05:33].

### Preferred Videos and Faculty
While not primarily a "video guy," Dr. Vinit found certain [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | Marrow videos]] particularly beneficial [00:05:36]. He highlighted Dr. Rohan Kandal's surgery videos as "amazing" [00:05:43, 00:05:44, 00:06:14, 00:06:16]. He also watched radiology videos after his final year, appreciating the animated concepts [00:06:25, 00:06:34, 00:06:35]. The concepts taught in these videos helped him in cracking tricky exam questions [00:06:45, 00:06:50].

## Strategic Use of Marrow QBank

Dr. Vinit was primarily a "Qbank guy" [00:11:12]. He solved most of the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | Marrow QBank]] during his internship [00:07:48, 00:07:49]. His strategy involved forming a study group with friends, setting a daily target of 100 MCQs, and motivating each other to complete it, even while on call [00:07:51, 00:07:53, 00:07:56, 00:07:59, 00:08:01, 00:08:03, 00:08:05, 00:08:07]. This approach allowed him to complete over 80% of the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | QBank]] in a couple of months [00:08:12, 00:08:13, 00:08:16]. He emphasized that this group motivation was crucial for his progress [00:08:38, 00:08:44].

## Leveraging Marrow Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. Vinit began taking [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] grand tests around June of his internship year, aiming for one GT every week [00:09:10, 00:09:13, 00:09:16, 00:09:24]. Importantly, he started giving these tests even before completing his entire subject reading [00:09:30, 00:09:35, 00:09:40, 00:09:47]. He acknowledged that he had not revised first and second-year subjects much when he started GTs [00:09:57, 00:59:59].

His key strategy for GTs was thorough analysis:
*   He would spend a significant portion of the week reviewing answers after each test [00:10:25, 00:10:28].
*   He would read the entire explanation for every single question, not just the ones he got wrong [00:10:32, 00:10:34, 00:11:10, 00:11:21, 00:11:26]. This rigorous review, taking about two hours for 50 questions, helped him understand entire topics [00:11:12, 00:11:14].
*   He noted that while questions might not repeat, topics covered in the explanations are often high-yield [00:10:37, 00:10:39]. For example, if a test asked about one parasite's egg, he would then read about all of them and make flashcards [00:10:41, 00:10:43, 00:10:45]. This approach helped him cover subjects he hadn't fully studied [00:10:16, 00:10:19, 00:10:23].

He consistently ranked between 40 and 75 in his practice exams, eventually improving to the top 20 consistently, and even top 10 a couple of times, leading to his final rank of 7 [00:02:51, 00:02:54, 00:02:57, 00:03:00, 00:03:03, 00:03:11, 00:03:16, 00:03:18, 00:03:21].

## Revision Strategies and Notes

Dr. Vinit is "not a big notes guy" and did not make his own notes [00:11:56, 00:11:59]. He used the [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] Edition Six notes for his MBBS exams in final year [00:12:02, 00:12:04]. Later, around December or January, he started reading the [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] revision notes [00:12:08, 00:12:12, 00:12:16].

For revision, he solely relied on the [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] notes and [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | QBank]], not watching any revision videos during his internship [00:12:44, 00:12:45, 00:12:47, 00:12:49, 00:12:52]. He attempted to cover everything in the last 15 days, completing about 10 subjects while continuously doing flashcards and reading [00:12:55, 00:12:57, 00:12:59, 00:13:02, 00:13:06]. The revision notes were helpful in covering a vast range of topics concisely [00:13:16, 00:13:19, 00:13:22, 00:13:29]. He strategically left high-yield factual subjects like anatomy and biochemistry for the end to keep them fresh in mind [00:13:36, 00:13:38, 00:13:40, 00:13:42, 00:13:45].

## Overall Impact of Marrow and Competitive Edge

Dr. Vinit firmly states that [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]] provides the "best question bank and the best grand test in the business" [00:14:28, 00:14:30, 00:14:32]. He found the explanations to be "top-notch," asserting that no other platform comes close [00:14:37, 00:14:40, 00:14:44]. The comprehensive resources offered by [[role_of_marrow_platform_in_medical_exam_preparation | Marrow]], including its videos, [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | QBank]], notes, and GTs, provided him with a significant competitive edge [00:14:16, 00:14:20, 00:14:22, 00:14:23, 00:14:25].

## Advice for Future Aspirants

For students preparing for the upcoming NEET PG exam, Dr. Vinit's final advice includes:
*   **Revision is Key**: Emphasize at least one full revision of all subjects before the exam [00:15:19, 00:15:21, 00:15:23, 00:15:24].
*   **Stay Calm**: Maintain composure during the exam [00:15:29].
*   **Eliminate Wrong Answers**: Focus on understanding why other options are incorrect, even if the right answer isn't immediately obvious, as every option provides a hint [00:15:31, 00:15:33, 00:15:39, 00:15:40, 00:15:44, 00:15:47, 00:15:48].
*   **Work on Weaknesses**: Concentrate on improving weaknesses to become stronger and perform well [00:16:34, 00:16:36, 00:16:38, 00:16:40].
*   **Mindset**: He also advises against tying self-worth to a rank, acknowledging that luck plays a part, though hard work is the true driver of success [00:17:28, 00:17:30, 00:17:32, 00:17:36, 00:17:50, 00:17:52, 00:17:55, 00:18:01, 00:18:03].

Dr. Vinit plans to pursue interventional radiology as his specialization [00:16:51, 00:16:57].

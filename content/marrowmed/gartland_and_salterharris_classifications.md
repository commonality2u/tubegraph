This article discusses two significant classifications used in Orthopedics: the Gartland Classification for supracondylar humeral fractures and the Salter-Harris Classification for growth plate injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These classifications are frequently tested in medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Gartland Classification

The Gartland classification is specifically used for supracondylar humeral fractures, which are fractures occurring just above the condyle of the humerus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Types of Gartland Classification

*   **Type 1:** This is an undisplaced fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The fracture line is typically not visible on radiographs, and diagnosis relies on indirect signs such as the fat pad sign and the sail sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Type 2:** In this type, only the anterior cortex is broken, while the posterior cortex remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. It is considered an incomplete fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Type 3:** Both the anterior and posterior cortices are broken, indicating a complete fracture with displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The most common complication of a supracondylar humeral fracture is malunion, specifically leading to a cubitus varus deformity, also known as gunstock deformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

## Salter-Harris Classification

The Salter-Harris classification is used for growth plate injuries, also known as physeal injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Injury to the epiphyseal (growth) plate can impair the longitudinal growth of the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. The growth occurs from the epiphysis to the metaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Mnemonic and Types

The mnemonic for Salter-Harris classification is **SALT-ER** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Type 1 (S - Straight through):** A split fracture where the growth plate is separated from the metaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Type 2 (A - Above):** A fracture that splits the growth plate, and the fracture line goes "above" into the metaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. A small triangular metaphyseal fragment, known as the Thurst Holland fragment, may be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Type 3 (L - Lower):** The fracture line splits the growth plate and goes "low" towards the epiphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This type involves injury to the germinal layer of the growth plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Type 4 (T - Through):** The fracture line goes "through" all three layers: epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Type 5 (ER - Erased/Crushed):** An impaction injury where the growth plate gets crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Key Layers of the Growth Plate

The growth plate consists of several layers: germinal, proliferative, hypertrophic, calcification, and ossification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   The **germinal layer** is the most important layer for longitudinal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   The **hypertrophic layer** is the weakest and most commonly injured layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Distinguishing Features

While supracondylar humeral fractures (classified by Gartland) can sometimes be a Salter-Harris type 1 or 2 fracture, the Gartland classification is specifically used for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Conversely, Salter-Harris is the general classification for growth plate injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. For instance, a lateral condyle humeral fracture, which involves injury to the germinal layer of the growth plate, can lead to cubitus valgus deformity due to the lateral condyle not growing, and the medial condyle continuing to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This can eventually result in a tardy ulnar nerve palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

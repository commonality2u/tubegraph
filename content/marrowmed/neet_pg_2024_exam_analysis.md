## Overall Exam Analysis
Dr. Rohan Kelal provided an analysis of the [[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | NEET PG]] 2024 surgery recall, noting that Session One and Session Two had an equal number of surgery questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Session One was comparatively easier than Session Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Session Two featured lengthier questions, trickier options, and more images, making it feel more challenging for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is hoped that normalization will resolve any issues and provide a fair rank for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Surgery Questions Overview
Surgery questions in Session One and Session Two were topic-wise matched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For instance, if one session had a question on V dressing, the other session also had a question from that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

A surprising observation was the significant number of Urology questions, especially in Session One, which was unusual compared to previous [[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | exams]] where Urology typically had only one or two questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. There were fewer questions from general surgery and trauma in both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The exam focused more on systemic surgery and conceptual questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Conceptual Understanding
The questions were conceptual, meaning they could not be answered by simply reading 100 facts a few days before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. A deep understanding of concepts was necessary, and shortcuts would not have been helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Advice for Future Preparation
Candidates are advised to develop good concepts, especially in clinical subjects, and not to rush through revision videos initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>. Building strong concepts by watching main videos is recommended for [[strategies_for_neetpg_2025_preparation | future preparation]], with filtering information done closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

>[!info] Key Takeaways
>The [[changes_in_neet_pg_exam_format_and_question_types | exam format]] emphasized conceptual understanding over rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Success requires strong [[skills_required_to_succeed_in_neet_pg_exams | skills]] in applying concepts rather than relying on last-minute factual recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>.

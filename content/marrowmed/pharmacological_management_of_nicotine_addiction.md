## Introduction
The INIC 2024 November psychiatric examination included a question requiring the matching of drugs to their uses, one of which pertained to smoking cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. [[tobacco_cessation_strategies | Tobacco cessation strategies]] are a recurring topic in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Brief Intervention: The 5 A's
A key brief intervention for tobacco cessation is known as the "5 A's intervention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. These steps are:
*   **Ask**: Routinely inquire if every patient smokes or uses nicotine in any form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Advise**: Strongly recommend and assertively advise patients to stop nicotine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Assess**: For patients who use nicotine, assess the level and frequency of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Assist**: Help patients in their efforts to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Arrange**: Schedule follow-up appointments to ensure accountability and maintain motivation, regardless of whether they have successfully quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Nicotine Supplementation (Nicotine Replacement Therapy)
[[nicotine_replacement_therapy | Nicotine Replacement Therapy]] (NRT), also known as nicotine supplementation, provides purified nicotine from an external source to reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving, making the quitting journey easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This approach is safer than smoking, which exposes users to over 4,000 chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### Forms of NRT
Common forms of nicotine supplementation include:
*   **Gums**: Available in 2 mg and 4 mg doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **Lozenges**: Also available in 2 mg and 4 mg doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **Patches**: Available in 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg per day doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. Patches are generally well-tolerated, simple to use (worn for 24 hours), and may only cause local allergy or occasional sleep disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Gums and lozenges can lead to oral ulcers, jaw pain, or mouth soreness due to constant chewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### Proper Use of Nicotine Gums
Nicotine gums require a specific technique called the "chew and park method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   Begin by chewing the gum until a burning or tingling sensation occurs in the mouth, indicating nicotine release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, avoid swallowing the juice, as this reduces nicotine absorption (low bioavailability) and can cause gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, or retrosternal burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   Patients should avoid hot beverages, water, or food for approximately 15 to 30 minutes after using the gum, as these can deactivate the nicotine or cause side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

## Anti-Craving Medications (Pharmacological Agents)
Beyond NRT, pharmacological agents are used to reduce nicotine craving:

### Varenicline
*   Considered the most effective medication for nicotine cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   Mechanism of action: It is an alpha-4 beta-2 partial agonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   While effective, its cost can be a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

### Bupropion
*   Increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels, thereby reducing craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   It is an antidepressant that does not act on serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Should be used with caution in patients with a history or family history of seizures, as it can lower the seizure threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

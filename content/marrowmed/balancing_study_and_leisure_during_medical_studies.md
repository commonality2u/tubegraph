Dr. Mayank, an FMG exam topper, shared insights into how he managed his studies while pursuing his MBBS from Nagor State Medical University in Russia, a six-year program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes consistency and strategic use of resources, rather than excessive study hours, while also incorporating time for leisure.

## Early Preparation and Consistent Study Habits

Dr. Mayank began his preparation for the FMG exam from his second year of MBBS, primarily using Mero videos for all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>. He completed all main videos by the end of his fifth year, dedicating his entire sixth year to revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:14">[07:27:14]</a>.

He maintained a daily study routine that involved watching videos and immediately attempting questions related to the topics covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:57">[04:47:57]</a>. This consistent practice from an early stage meant he didn't feel the need to devote excessive hours to studying.

## Study Time Management

Dr. Mayank's daily study routine varied based on his academic commitments. During his second year, when COVID-19 led to him being at home, he focused on Pharmacology and Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:48">[05:14:48]</a>. He stated that studying for 10 hours a day is "not possible" and would "damage his brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:48">[05:26:48]</a>. Instead, after attending university classes, he typically studied for five to six hours, or even four to five hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:17">[05:30:17]</a>.

This approach demonstrates a [[managing_time_and_resources_during_medical_education | balanced approach to time management]], allowing for consistent study without burnout.

## Importance of Question Banks and Tests

Dr. Mayank highlighted the critical role of question banks and grand tests (GTs) in his preparation:

*   **Question Bank Integration:** He used NEET PG question banks from the beginning, after watching videos to immediately apply the concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules:** In the final six months, he used custom modules daily, solving 100 questions from all 19 subjects. This helped him stay connected with all subjects and provided continuous revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:30">[10:00:30]</a>. Custom modules randomized questions from multiple subjects, simulating exam conditions and testing his ability to identify answers without subject bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs):** He strongly advised taking GTs to identify weaknesses and improve subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. He started taking GTs in his sixth year and consistently scored over 200, which he considered a good baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:30">[08:13:30]</a>. He compared taking GTs to stepping on a weighing machine to understand one's current standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. He noted that many students avoid GTs due to fear of low scores, but emphasized that knowing your weakness before the exam is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

## Notes and Revision Strategy

Dr. Mayank initially tried writing his own notes for Pharmacology and Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:25">[06:22:25]</a>. Later, he used printed digital notes from Mero and augmented them by adding important information from question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:05">[06:29:05]</a>. For final revision, he relied on Rapid Revision Notes, incorporating points from main videos and the Q-Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

Dr. Mayank stated that while studying is crucial, having fun is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. He advised juniors to maintain a balance, suggesting that by adding "two to three hours extra daily" of focused study, a lot of time can be saved in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

## Key Advice for Juniors

Dr. Mayank's main advice for aspiring students aiming for high scores includes:
*   Start early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
*   Watch main videos sincerely to build a strong conceptual base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.
*   Make notes and add information from question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   Do not be afraid of the question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
*   Do not be afraid of grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   Focus heavily on solving questions as the primary means of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   Understand that rapid revision videos are recaps, and a strong foundation from main videos is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

His overall strategy emphasizes early, consistent, and conceptual learning, combined with extensive practice through questions and tests, while also allowing for personal enjoyment during the long medical journey.

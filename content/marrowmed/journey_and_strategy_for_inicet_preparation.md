Dr. Tes Dagan, a Radiology resident at PJ Chandigarh Institute and a Marrow user, excelled in the recently conducted [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | INICET November 2024 exam]] with an impressive rank eight in his second attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He shared his [[improvement_journey_from_neetpg_to_inicet | journey]] of [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | PG preparation]] and offered valuable insights into the [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Early Preparation and Foundation
Dr. Dagan started as a studious student from his first year of undergraduate studies, relying on standard textbooks for his first and second years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He began using Marrow from his third year for third and fourth-year subjects, later integrating it for first and second-year subjects as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He emphasized that a strong basic foundation from first and second-year subjects is vital, as it covers the majority of third and fourth-year subjects, reducing the need for extra effort later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!info] Strong Basics are Key
> A solid basic knowledge is paramount before delving into detailed video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Marrow Video Utilization
Dr. Dagan primarily used Marrow videos for third and fourth-year subjects, learning them from scratch without textbooks for those years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For first and second-year subjects, where his knowledge was already strong, he selectively watched videos for topics he was unsure of or frequently got wrong in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Subjects where Marrow made a significant difference for him included ENT (Otolaryngology) and Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## QBank as the Main Source
For Dr. Dagan, the Marrow QBank was his main source of [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. His approach involved:
*   **Systematic Solving**: Going through every question from the first module to the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking & Organization**: Making notes or taking photos of important information and organizing them into folders for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Recognizing that the QBank covers content from entire standard textbooks, including tables and pearls in explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Multiple Revisions**: Revising these folders multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He applied this method to about 10-12 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Solving a large number of MCQs (like the 15-20K questions in Marrow QBank) helped him develop the skill of ruling out options and identifying correct answers, which comes with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Marrow Test Series Strategy
Dr. Dagan began taking Marrow's Grand Tests (GTs) at the start of his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He also took subject tests as they became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He generally avoided mini-tests due to them causing anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

His primary focus was on subject tests and GTs, with a strong emphasis on reviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He religiously reviewed all incorrect answers in subject tests and devoted an entire day to reviewing each Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

> [!tip] Benchmarking Performance
> While GTs primarily serve for knowledge assessment, they are also useful for benchmarking performance against other aspirants on the Marrow platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Consistent good ranks provide a confidence boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. GTs were crucial for him to identify weaker subjects and prioritize them during revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

He advises that if students start their [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | preparation]] in their final year, they should already have a list of weaker subjects, which they can then prioritize during their internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Note-Taking and Custom Modules
Dr. Dagan preferred not to rely on handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. He used Marrow's in-video notes and printed notes from his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. During his internship, his main "notes" were the folders created from the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He also added content from QBanks, GTs, and older GTs to these folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He shifted to online and PDF reading during MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

While not an avid user of custom modules, he sometimes used them with friends during internship for mixed bag practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This helped them engage with questions in a different format and stay motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He advises using previous year question (PYQ) tags for custom modules, though he personally preferred mixed bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. He didn't rely too much on PYQs, as he didn't believe most questions would be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Revision Strategy
For revision, Dr. Dagan primarily revised his QBank folders repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. For his first [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | INICET]] attempt (May), he aimed for two full revisions but managed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. He also gave six tests in the last 10 days before the May exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. For his second attempt in November, his [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | preparation]] was not as intensive; he mainly gave a few GTs before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

> [!tip] Revision Advice
> One full revision combined with a lot of practice tests is sufficient in the last month before the [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Marrow Marathon and Motivation
Dr. Dagan acknowledged the Marrow Marathon as a great concept for motivation, encouraging daily problem-solving and helping aspirants stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Final Advice for Aspirants
Dr. Dagan's key advice for juniors and aspirants preparing for the [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | INICET exam]] is:
*   **Early Goal Setting**: Decide on your target branch and aim early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Monitor GT Ranks**: Use GT ranks to gauge your performance and progress towards your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Be consistent throughout your [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | preparation]], rather than trying to cram everything at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Practice**: Prepare well in advance and practice consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

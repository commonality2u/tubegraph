This article discusses the radiological approaches to diagnosing and characterizing urolithiasis (renal and ureteric calculi) and gallbladder calculi, as well as common bile duct calculi, based on an INCT November 2024 Radiology recall session.

## Urolithiasis (Renal and Ureteric Calculi)

### Clinical Presentation and Initial Investigation
Patients presenting with acute lumbar pain radiating from the loin to the groin, accompanied by burning and frequent micturition, are typically suspected to have [[diagnosis_and_imaging_in_acute_renal_colic | acute renal colic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
The initial investigation commonly performed in hospitals is ultrasound (USG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. USG is considered the investigation of choice for detecting hydronephrosis because "fluid is friend of ultrasound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

### Investigation of Choice for Calculi
While USG is common initially, it is *not* the [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for renal calculi]] because "air is the enemy of ultrasound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Kidneys and ureters are retroperitoneal structures, and bowel loops with gas can obscure tiny ureteric calculi on ultrasound, making tracing the ureter challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
The definitive [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for acute renal colic]] or renal/ureteric calculi is a non-contrast CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### Calculus Composition
*   **Most Common:** The most common renal or ureteric calculus is calcium oxalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Calcium is well visualized on CT scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   **Dual Energy CT:** A dual energy CT scan can help determine the underlying calculus composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.
*   **Radiolucent Calculi (on X-ray):**
    *   Uric acid calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>
    *   Indinavir calculi (from anti-retroviral drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>
    *   Pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>
*   **Calculi Not Seen on CT:** Indinavir calculi and pure matrix calculi may not be identified even on CT scan, though uric acid calculi *are* picked up on CT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

### Radiological Signs and Their Significance
[[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | Renal calculi]] appear as hyper-echoic foci with a dense posterior shadow on USG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.

*   **Staghorn Calculus:**
    *   Characterized by a shape resembling the horn of a stag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.
    *   These are typically struvite calculi, also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.
    *   They form a cast of calculus material filling the entire pelvicalyceal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.
    *   Commonly associated with urease-producing microbes such as chronic Proteus, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.
*   **Jack Stone Vesical Calculus:**
    *   Seen in the urinary bladder, taking a pointed or speculated shape, resembling a jack stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.
    *   Composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate and are very fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Soft Tissue Rim Sign (Ureteric Calculus):**
    *   On CT scan, an impacted ureteric calculus may show a soft tissue rim (the thickened, edematous ureteric wall) around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
    *   This sign is crucial for distinguishing ureteric calculi from phleboliths (calcifications in pelvic veins) in the pelvic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
    *   Phleboliths typically show "comet tail artifacts" on CT, whereas impacted ureteric calculi exhibit the soft tissue rim sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

### Hydronephrosis
Hydronephrosis refers to the dilation of the renal calyces, pelvis, and ureter due to obstruction, filling with anechoic fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. USG is the [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for detection of hydronephrosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

## Gallbladder Calculi (GB Calculi)

*   **Composition:** Most GB calculi are mixed calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **CT Limitations:** Due to their poor calcium content, GB calculi are often not identifiable on CT scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>.
*   **Investigation of Choice:** The [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for GB calculi]] is ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Common Bile Duct (CBD) Calculi

*   **USG Challenges:** Tracing the entire CBD, particularly its terminal portion where it enters the duodenum, can be very difficult on USG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. If a calculus is stuck here, USG might show bile tree dilation but not the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.
*   **Investigation of Choice:** The [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for CBD calculi]] is Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. On MRCP, calculi appear as filling defects within the hyperintense bile in the biliary tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

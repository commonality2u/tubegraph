Maintaining consistent motivation and effectively managing periods where performance plateaus or dips are crucial aspects of long-term study and exam preparation.

## Strategies for Maintaining Motivation

Dr. Shashwat, who secured rank two in the INICT exam, emphasized the importance of self-motivation, especially when facing challenges or falling behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Setting Clear Goals** Dr. Shashwat's primary motivation was to "do it this year itself the first attempt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Persistent Focus** Even on "bad day[s] or something happened I was not able to complete my target I just try to focus and then I completed that subject only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Adhering to the Plan** He would not leave a decided task for another day, preferring to "shift my schedule for one day ahead" or utilize a "buffer day" to catch up on lost time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Dealing with Performance Plateaus and Dips

It is common for students to experience phases where their performance in Grand Tests (GTs) plateaus or even dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Dr. Shashwat shared his approach to [[dealing_with_preparation_plateaus | dealing with preparation plateaus]] and performance dips:

*   **Acknowledge, Don't Demotivate** "initially first GT went well but then the second third GT my performance really dipped. So I did I got a bit demotivated but then I still kept focusing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. He viewed dips as an opportunity to identify weak areas rather than a source of demotivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Focus on Weak Subjects** When performance dipped, the primary strategy was to "focus on your weak subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. For example, if he was consistently doing well in ENT, he wouldn't revise it in the last six months, but if subjects like physiology or anatomy were consistently weaker, he would "focus more on those subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Objective Review and Moving On** After a GT, he would review the test, "sleep over it and next day was a fresh start just focusing on what I had to take take from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of not dwelling on past performance but using it constructively for future [[overcoming_challenges_and_improving_performance_in_competitive_exams | improvement]].
*   **Focus on Correct Questions, Not Just Rank** Towards the end of preparation, when mock exam ranks fluctuated, he "didn't focus much more on the rank. I focused on the number of correct that I was doing and so that was consistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

>[!TIP] Don't let performance dips demotivate you. Instead, use them as diagnostic tools to identify and address your weak areas, then move forward with a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

[[Sterilization and Disinfection Methods | Sterilization and disinfection]] is considered a very important topic in the INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Methods and Applications

### Flaming (Red Heat Sterilization)
[[General Bacteriology and Culture Techniques | Bacteriological loops]], used for [[General Bacteriology and Culture Techniques | culture media]] inoculation, are commonly sterilized by placing them in a flame until they become red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This method is preferred for loops, which are often made of expensive materials like platinum or nichrome, because they require repeated sterilization, making autoclaving impractical for frequent use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Passing Through Flame (Disinfection)
Passing items through a flame three times is a method used for the disinfection of slides and cover slips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Autoclaving
While [[General Bacteriology and Culture Techniques | bacteriological loops]] *can* be autoclaved, this method is generally not used for routine, rapid sterilization due to the need for frequent sterilization of loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Specific applications for autoclaving were not detailed in this discussion.

### Microwave
Microwave sterilization was listed as an option for sterilizing [[General Bacteriology and Culture Techniques | bacteriological loops]], but it was not identified as the correct or preferred method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

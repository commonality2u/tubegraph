[[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | Eagle's syndrome]], also known as stylalgia, is a condition characterized by an [[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | enlarged styloid process]] and/or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. This anatomical enlargement can lead to a variety of symptoms due to its proximity to crucial neurovascular structures.

## Anatomy and Prevalence
The styloid process divides the parapharyngeal space into anterior and posterior compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. While the [[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | enlarged styloid process]] is present in about 4% of individuals, only 4-10% of these cases are symptomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

## Causes
The enlargement of the styloid process and calcification of the stylohyoid ligament often follow an injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This trauma can occur after procedures such as:
*   Tonsillectomy, where the stylohyoid ligament or styloid process may be injured during surgery on the tonsil bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   Trauma to the parapharyngeal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

## Clinical Features and Complications
[[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | Eagle's syndrome]] can manifest with a range of symptoms and [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | complications]] due to the impingement of the enlarged styloid process on adjacent structures:

*   **Nerve Involvement**:
    *   The styloid process is in close relation to cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
    *   **Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX)**: Most commonly affected, leading to painful swallowing (dysphagia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Pain can also be referred to the ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies the oropharynx, including the tonsils and base of the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.
    *   **Vagus (X), Accessory (XI), and Hypoglossal (XII) Nerves**: Movement of the head can cause the enlarged styloid process to impinge on these nerves, leading to associated symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
    *   Facial pain can also be present due to the impairment of these nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

*   **Foreign Body Sensation**: The [[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | enlarged styloid process]] can impinge on the bed of the tonsils, causing a foreign body sensation in the throat or pain upon palpation of the tonsils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

*   **Vascular Compression**:
    *   The internal carotid artery and jugular vein are located near the styloid process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
    *   Compression of the internal carotid artery can lead to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
    *   Compression of the jugular vein can result in related symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

The presence of persistent ear discharge is typically *not* associated with [[Eagles syndrome and nerve injury | Eagle's syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

Dr. Shloka, who secured an impressive Rank 3 in her first attempt at the INIC exam, attributes a significant portion of her success to consistent [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | revision]] and [[the_impact_of_consistent_practice_tests_on_exam_performance | practice tests]]. Her journey highlights the strategic use of study materials and a disciplined approach to preparation.

## Early Preparation and Support System

Dr. Shloka began her preparation by using Marrow from her third professional year through her internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. She initially focused on main videos and concurrently solved questions from the Qbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Her family and friends provided crucial support, helping her stay balanced, especially during the intense last one to one-and-a-half months leading up to the exam, which involved numerous mock tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Adapting to Study Material Updates

Dr. Shloka demonstrated adaptability in managing study material updates. When Marrow notes transitioned from Edition 5 (which she initially used) to Edition 8, she chose not to purchase new notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Instead, she integrated points from the online Edition 8 notes into her existing Edition 5 notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. She found Edition 8 to be a more concise version with helpful tables and flowcharts, making the transition manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. She advises against the fear of missing out (FOMO) trap of constantly acquiring new notes if existing ones can be effectively updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Strategic Use of Videos and Notes

Videos played a vital role in concept building for her professional exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. During her internship, she shifted her focus to [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | revision notes]] and used main video notes to strengthen her conceptual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. She also utilized revision videos for passive learning when she was tired, such as after duty periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Personalized Revision Tools

Dr. Shloka employed a unique and effective [[importance_of_personalized_revision_techniques_and_mock_tests | personalized revision technique]]: creating a WhatsApp chat with herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In this chat, she would send volatile information, tables, or complex syndromes with associated pictures for quick and easy revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This method saved time and allowed her to revise even during postings, contributing to answering several questions in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## The Importance of Qbank and Grand Tests

### Qbank Strategy

Dr. Shloka solved the Qbank modules alongside her initial learning of subjects in her third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. She would reset the Qbank if she wanted to solve them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. She noted a significant improvement in her performance when revisiting the Qbank during internship, as she gained a more holistic understanding of clinical subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Reattempting the Qbank after gaining clinical knowledge is crucial for improving scores in both modules and grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. She solved each Qbank module at least once or twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Journey

Dr. Shloka was regular with tests, starting with class tests to build confidence before moving to Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

*   **Early Start:** She began taking GTs at the beginning of her final year, though in hindsight, she believes starting in the third professional year would have been beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. She advises starting GTs early to get a feel for the exam format, especially with the section-wise format, which can take 5-10 GTs to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Completing Syllabus:** She emphasizes that one should not wait to complete the entire syllabus before starting GTs, as it is a vast syllabus that can never be fully completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Starting early can enhance guessing power and the ability to think differently to arrive at the correct options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Frequency:**
    *   Initially, during final year, she gave bi-weekly GTs (every 15 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
    *   Towards the end of final year and beginning of internship, she gave weekly GTs on Sundays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   In the last month of internship, the frequency increased to two to three GTs per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### GT Review Strategy

Her GT review strategy was efficient and focused:
*   She preferred reviewing GTs just before they expired, on the same day as the exam, so questions were fresh in her mind, saving review time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   If time was short, she prioritized reviewing skipped and wrong questions immediately after seeing the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This quick review (1-1.5 hours for 20-25 wrong questions) ensured she understood her mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   She also reviewed correct answers when time permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### Addressing GT Score Dips

When her GT scores plateaued or dipped, Dr. Shloka utilized Marrow's feature that ranked subjects by performance (percentiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Her strategy was to focus on her lowest-performing subjects to bring their scores up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. For instance, instead of continuously studying her strongest subject (Medicine), she repeatedly studied volatile and difficult subjects like Anesthesia, which ultimately improved her overall GT scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Mock Test Learning

Dr. Shloka's experience with the INIC mock test was a critical learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Despite usually ranking in the top 20 in other GTs, she got 33rd rank in the mock test, scoring 177 corrects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This was due to overthinking questions, assuming they *had* to be difficult because it was an INIC mock test, even though the actual test was comparatively easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This experience taught her to take some questions at face value and not overthink, which was crucial for her success in the actual INIC exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Last-Month Revision Strategy

For the final month leading up to the exam, Dr. Shloka's [[the_role_of_focused_study_and_revision_in_competitive_exams | revision]] strategy was focused:
*   She relied solely on [[effective_use_of_grand_tests_and_revision_notes | revision notes]], previous year's questions (PYQs), and her own supplementary notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   She emphasized that PYQs, while important, often repeat topics rather than exact questions, and options can be very in-depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Thus, in-depth knowledge of repeated topics is necessary, not just memorizing answers to old questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   She advised against wasting time on extremely niche or random PYQs that are unlikely to be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   For the NEET PG exam, if she hadn't secured her INIC rank, her strategy for the last 20 days would still involve [[role_of_revision_in_pathology_exams | revision notes]], PYQs, and her own notes, avoiding new material to prevent added stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from Dr. Shloka's Experience

*   **Early and Consistent Practice:** Starting GTs early, even before syllabus completion, helps familiarize oneself with the exam pattern and develop critical thinking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Revision:** Utilize performance analysis from tests to identify and improve weak subjects, rather than constantly reviewing strong ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Effective Review of Tests:** Promptly reviewing mistakes in GTs is paramount. Prioritize wrong and skipped questions if time is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of Resources:** Adapt to study material updates smartly without succumbing to FOMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Use features like subject-wise performance analysis to guide your [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | revision tactics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Personalized Study Methods:** Innovative methods like a "WhatsApp chat" for volatile information can be highly effective for quick [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_revision | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mock Tests:** Treat mock tests as learning opportunities, especially from mistakes like overthinking, to fine-tune your approach for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Last-Minute Focus:** Stick to familiar and well-understood notes and PYQs in the final weeks before an exam, avoiding new topics or materials that could add stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

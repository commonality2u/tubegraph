> [!INFO] Paper Overview
> The NEET PG 2024 Pharmacology paper was generally considered **moderate to difficult** [00:00:14]. Students reported that Session 1 was slightly easier compared to Session 2 [00:00:22]. This discussion aims to provide insights for future aspirants, particularly for [[Strategies for NEETPG 2025 preparation | NEET PG 2025]] [00:00:31].

## Session 1 Questions

### 1. Urinary Incontinence Treatment
A 75-year-old female presented with urinary incontinence, cognitive decline, and dementia. The question asked which drug is useful for treating urinary incontinence from the given options [00:00:35].

*   **Correct Answer:** Tolterodine [00:00:56].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   For urge urinary incontinence, the drug of choice is a beta-agonist, specifically **Mirabegron** [00:01:08]. Mirabegron is preferred because anticholinergics, like tolterodine, can cause dementia by blocking M1 receptors [00:01:20].
    *   If Mirabegron cannot be used (due to price or availability), preferred anticholinergics are those that cause lesser dementia [00:01:28]. These include **Darifenacin**, **Solifenacin**, and **Trospium** [00:01:38].
    *   Darifenacin and Solifenacin are selective M3 blockers [00:01:56], while Trospium does not cross the blood-brain barrier [00:02:02].
    *   Tolterodine is not absolutely selective for M3 receptors but has more M3 selectivity compared to M1 or M2 [00:02:27]. In the given options, Tolterodine was the only drug used for incontinence [00:02:54]. Other options like Tiotropium, Atropine, or Telenzepine are not used for this condition [00:02:49].

### 2. Multiple Myeloma and Herpes Zoster Reactivation
The question asked which drug used to treat multiple myeloma causes reactivation of Herpes Zoster [00:03:12].

*   **Correct Answer:** Bortezomib [00:04:10].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   All listed drugs (Lenalidomide, Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Elotuzumab) can be used in multiple myeloma regimens [00:03:51].
    *   **Bortezomib**, a proteasome inhibitor [00:03:36], has a higher incidence of Herpes Zoster reactivation [00:04:10]. This is because it suppresses the immune system [00:04:14].
    *   Prophylactic acyclovir (400 micrograms oral) is given with Bortezomib to prevent herpes reactivation or new infections [00:04:26].

### 3. Beta-Blockers for Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
The question asked which beta-blocker is useful in reducing mortality in CHF patients with reduced ejection fraction, without exacerbations for a few years [00:05:08].

*   **Correct Answer:** Bisoprolol [00:05:52].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Only four beta-blockers are approved for reducing mortality in chronic CHF: **Bisoprolol**, **Carvedilol**, **Metoprolol** (succinate extended-release), and **Nebivolol** [00:05:42].
    *   These can be remembered by the mnemonic "BC MN" [00:05:18].
    *   This is a frequently asked topic in [[Exam pattern and preparation strategies for NEET PG 2024 | NEET PG]] exams, emphasizing the importance of mastering core topics rather than memorizing specific MCQs [00:06:08].

### 4. Opioid Addiction Maintenance Therapy
Which drug is used for opioid addiction maintenance therapy? [00:06:24]

*   **Correct Answer:** Buprenorphine [00:07:16].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   To decrease withdrawal symptoms in opioid addiction, **Buprenorphine** or **Methadone** are used [00:06:47].
    *   After withdrawal symptoms subside, **Naltrexone** is given to prevent relapse [00:07:03].

### 5. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in Scleroderma
An elderly patient with Scleroderma presented with right ventricular pressure of 70-80 mmHg and PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) of 35 mmHg (normal 4-12 mmHg), indicating pulmonary artery hypertension. The question asked for the treatment [00:07:30].

*   **Correct Answer:** Endothelin receptor blockers [00:08:36].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   For Stage II and III PAH, **Endothelin receptor blockers** (like Bosentan, Ambrisentan) are the drugs of choice [00:08:18]. They can be combined with Sildenafil or Tadalafil [00:08:20].
    *   For Stage IV PAH, **Epoprostenol** (synthetic prostaglandin I2) is the drug of choice [00:08:26].
    *   Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are given only if a vasoactive test during right-sided catheterization is positive [00:08:40]. CCBs like Diltiazem, Amlodipine, or longer-acting Nifedipine can be used, but **Verapamil is never used** in PAH [00:09:07].

### 6. Diuretic for Renal Colic in Chronic Kidney Disease
A hypertensive patient with chronic kidney disease has frequent attacks of renal colic. Which diuretic is used? [00:09:24]

*   **Correct Answer:** Hydrochlorothiazide [00:10:29].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Renal colic attacks often indicate renal stones [00:09:40].
    *   **Thiazide diuretics** (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide) increase calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) by decreasing calcium excretion in the urine [00:09:56]. This property helps in decreasing the risk of hypercalciuric renal stones [00:10:15].
    *   Furosemide, a loop diuretic, has the opposite effect; it increases calcium in urine and decreases calcium in blood, which can contribute to stone formation [00:10:35].

### 7. Anti-Fibrinolytic Drug
The question presented a diagram where the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was marked and asked which drug acts on this stage, inhibiting plasmin [00:11:00]. This implies asking for an anti-fibrinolytic drug [00:11:31].

*   **Correct Answer:** Aminocaproic acid [00:11:47].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Plasmin causes fibrinolysis (breakdown of fibrin) [00:11:17].
    *   Drugs that decrease plasmin activity or decrease fibrin degradation are anti-fibrinolytics [00:11:36].
    *   The two main anti-fibrinolytic drugs are **Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid** and **Tranexamic Acid** [00:11:42].
    *   Other options like Clopidogrel (anti-aggregant), t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator, increases plasmin), and Heparin (anticoagulant) are not anti-fibrinolytic [00:11:51].

### 8. Loading Dose Dependence
Lidocaine is used as a loading dose for arrhythmia treatment. The question asked which factor the loading dose depends on [00:12:03].

*   **Correct Answer:** Volume of distribution [00:12:28].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Loading dose** of a drug depends on its **volume of distribution** [00:12:27].
    *   **Maintenance dose** and **infusion rate** depend on **clearance** [00:12:31].
    *   This is a frequently asked direct question in pharmacology [00:12:39].

### 9. Aprepitant Mechanism of Action
A patient undergoing surgery developed nausea and vomiting and was prescribed Aprepitant. The question asked for its mechanism of action [00:12:47].

*   **Correct Answer:** Neurokinin-1 antagonist [00:12:59].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Drugs with the suffix "ant" or "nant" typically indicate an antagonist [00:13:07].
    *   **Aprepitant** is a **neurokinin-1 antagonist** [00:12:59]. It is primarily used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and post-surgical nausea and vomiting [00:13:22].

### 10. Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy (First Trimester)
Which drug should be used for hyperthyroidism in a pregnant female at 8 weeks of gestation (first trimester)? [00:13:40]

*   **Correct Answer:** Propylthiouracil (PTU) [00:14:11].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   In the **first trimester** of pregnancy, the preferred drug for hyperthyroidism is **Propylthiouracil (PTU)** [00:13:53].
    *   In the **second or third trimester**, Methimazole or Carbimazole are preferred [00:13:57].
    *   Other drugs like radioactive iodine are teratogenic and can cause fetal congenital hypothyroidism [00:14:18].

### 11. SNRI for ADHD
Which of the following is an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) used for ADHD treatment? [00:14:27]

*   **Correct Answer:** Reboxetine [00:14:52].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   While Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for ADHD [00:14:36], it is not an SNRI [00:14:42]. Modafinil and Clonidine are also not SNRIs [00:14:43].
    *   **Atomoxetine** is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used for ADHD [00:15:00].
    *   **Reboxetine** and **Viloxazine** are also selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that can be used for ADHD [00:15:23].

## Session 2 Questions

### 1. Terlipressin for HIV-Associated Lipoatrophy
A drug X is a GNR analog approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy, not used for growth hormone deficiency. Identify drug X [00:15:45].

*   **Correct Answer:** Tesamorelin [00:16:35].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   The question likely had a typo in "GNR analog" as **Tesamorelin** is a **GHRH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone) analog** [00:16:41].
    *   GHRH analogs and GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) analogs typically end with the suffix "-relin" [00:16:13].
    *   Tesamorelin was approved in 2018 specifically for HIV-associated lipodystrophy [00:17:25].
    *   It increases growth hormone and IGF-1, leading to lipolysis in the trunk/abdomen, which helps in reducing excess fat deposition seen with HIV [00:17:32]. It is not used for dwarfism [00:18:05].

### 2. Methotrexate and Nucleotide Synthesis
A patient with gynecological malignancy started on Methotrexate developed oral and gastric ulcers. Which nucleotide synthesis is affected? [00:18:11]

*   **Correct Answer:** Thymidine monophosphate (TMP) [00:19:09].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Methotrexate blocks dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [00:18:47].
    *   DHFR is crucial for converting dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolate, which provides methyl groups to thymidylate synthase [00:18:43].
    *   By inhibiting DHFR, Methotrexate decreases tetrahydrofolate, thereby cutting the supply of methyl groups needed by thymidylate synthase. This leads to a decrease in the synthesis of **Thymidine Monophosphate (TMP)** from deoxyuridine monophosphate [00:18:52].

### 3. Dose Determination in Clinical Trials
Dose studying/determination is done in which phase of clinical trials? [00:19:14]

*   **Correct Answer:** Phase II [00:20:12].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Phase I** determines the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [00:19:24]. For example, if MTD is 100 mg, beyond this toxicity occurs [00:19:33].
    *   **Phase II** designs the dose range (e.g., 20-80 mg) based on the MTD [00:19:51]. This phase is the first time the drug is given to actual patients, and multiple doses within the range are tested to determine efficacy and optimal dosing [00:20:21]. Therefore, dose determination occurs in Phase II [00:20:15].

### 4. Hypertensive Emergency Due to Withdrawal
A hypertensive patient on a drug for one year, experiencing dry mouth, drowsiness, and confusion, developed hypertensive emergency after forgetting to take medications. Identify the drug [00:20:36].

*   **Correct Answer:** Clonidine [00:21:03].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Clonidine** is known to cause **withdrawal hypertension** or **rebound hypertension** if stopped abruptly [00:21:05].
    *   The underlying cause of clonidine withdrawal hypertension is alpha-2 down-regulation [00:21:13]. This is a recurring topic in [[Strategies for NEET PG exam | NEET PG exam]]s [00:21:20].

### 5. Atropine in Diphenoxylate Formulations
Atropine at a particular dose is added to Diphenoxylate for which reason in the treatment of secretory diarrhea? [00:21:32]

*   **Correct Answer:** To prevent overdose and abuse of Diphenoxylate [00:22:47].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   For secretory diarrhea, Loperamide, Diphenoxylate, or Dioctyl can be used [00:21:40].
    *   **Loperamide** is preferred because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has no abuse potential [00:22:08].
    *   **Diphenoxylate** and **Difenoxin** (Dioctyl) *do* cross the blood-brain barrier and have abuse potential [00:22:15].
    *   **Atropine** is added to these formulations. Its anticholinergic side effects discourage patients from abusing the drug, as taking high doses to "enjoy" the opioid effect would lead to unpleasant atropine side effects [00:22:24].

### 6. Drug Interaction: Rifampicin and Nevirapine
An HIV patient with TB is on Lamivudine, Zidovudine, and Nevirapine. Which anti-TB (NTB) drug should be changed? [00:22:53]

*   **Correct Answer:** Rifampicin [00:23:18].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Rifampicin** is a potent enzyme inducer [00:23:23].
    *   It can induce the metabolism of **Nevirapine** [00:23:30], reducing its effectiveness.
    *   While the scenario mentioned Nevirapine (which is generally not used due to fatal hepatotoxicity), the core concept tested is the enzyme induction by Rifampicin [00:23:36]. Lamivudine and Zidovudine are generally not significantly affected by Rifampicin in this context [00:23:11].

### 7. Side Effects of Hypertriglyceridemia Medication
A patient with hypertriglyceridemia was started on medication and developed a triad of flushing, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes [00:23:52].

*   **Correct Answer:** Niacin/Nicotinic acid [00:24:05].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   The triad of **flushing, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes** is characteristic of **Niacin (nicotinic acid)** [00:24:05].
    *   While Niacin is not a first-line drug for hypertriglyceridemia (fibrates and statins are generally preferred) [00:24:33], it can be used in severe cases where other options have failed [00:24:17].

### 8. Alcohol Withdrawal Management
A chronic alcoholic patient with blood alcohol level >300 mg/dL is hospitalized and will be withheld from alcohol. Which drug is used to manage withdrawal symptoms? [00:24:44]

*   **Correct Answer:** Lorazepam [00:25:05].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Benzodiazepines** are the drug of choice for managing alcohol withdrawal symptoms [00:25:07].
    *   Commonly used benzodiazepines include **Diazepam** and **Lorazepam** [00:25:08].
    *   **Lorazepam** is often preferred, especially in patients with liver failure or alcoholic liver disease, because it does not require hepatic metabolism [00:25:13].
    *   Other options like Methyl alcohol (toxic), Fomepizole (methanol poisoning antidote), and Bupropion (anti-smoking drug) are incorrect [00:24:54].

### 9. Ciclesonide in Bronchial Asthma
A child was started on Ciclesonide inhalational therapy for bronchial asthma. Which statement is correct? [00:25:32]

*   **Correct Answer:** It is a prodrug [00:26:45] and has fewer side effects [00:26:47].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Ciclesonide** is an **inactive prodrug** [00:26:08].
    *   It remains inactive while passing through the oral cavity, thus reducing the incidence of oral candidiasis [00:26:05].
    *   It is activated by esterases in the bronchi to its active form, exerting its effect on asthma [00:26:15].
    *   Therefore, the occurrence of oral candidiasis is *less* compared to other inhaled steroids [00:26:36]. Oral bioavailability is negligible as it's an inhalational steroid [00:26:51].

### 10. Serotonin Syndrome Initial Management
A patient on Sertraline (SSRI) was additionally given Tramadol and developed agitation, disorientation, and seizures. What is the best initial management? [00:27:01]

*   **Correct Answer:** Lorazepam [00:27:28].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   The diagnosis is **Serotonin Syndrome** due to the combination of an SSRI and Tramadol [00:27:12].
    *   While **Cyproheptadine** (a 5-HT2 blocker) is the specific **antidote** for serotonin syndrome [00:27:23], the **initial management** for symptomatic treatment is typically a benzodiazepine like **Lorazepam** [00:27:30].
    *   If the patient does not respond to Lorazepam, then Cyproheptadine is considered [00:27:39]. Serotonin syndrome is a recurring topic in [[Exam pattern and preparation strategies for NEET PG 2024 | NEET PG exam]]s [00:27:58].

### 11. Drug Causing Torsades de Pointes with Erythromycin
Which drug, when added with Erythromycin, can lead to Torsades de Pointes? [00:28:05]

*   **Correct Answer:** Astemizole [00:28:49].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Erythromycin can inhibit the metabolism of certain drugs, leading to increased plasma levels and increased risk of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes.
    *   **Astemizole** and **Terfenadine** are two second-generation antihistamines that were historically known to cause QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes when combined with drugs like Erythromycin, leading to their ban [00:28:22].
    *   Although banned, they are still taught to highlight such drug interactions [00:28:46].

### 12. Management of PSVT in a Child
A two-year-old child presents with lethargy, difficulty feeding, dehydration, and an ECG showing PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). What is the next step for management? [00:29:55]

*   **Correct Answer:** Adenosine 0.1 mg/kg IV rapid push [00:29:38].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   For PSVT, **Adenosine** is the drug of choice [00:29:05].
    *   The adult dose is 6 mg IV rapid push [00:29:07].
    *   For children, the initial dose is **0.1 mg/kg** [00:29:21].
    *   If the patient does not respond, the dose can be increased to 0.2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 12 mg [00:29:25].
    *   PSVT management is a common topic in exams [00:29:40].

### 13. Spasmolytic for IBS with Diarrhea
A patient diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) complains of diarrhea with lower abdominal pain. Which drug would have a direct spasmolytic effect? [00:29:52]

*   **Correct Answer:** Dicyclomine [00:30:11].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Dicyclomine** is an antispasmodic drug commonly used for visceral pain, such as that seen in IBS-diarrhea type, dysmenorrhea, or abdominal cramps due to infectious diarrhea [00:30:14].
    *   It relaxes the smooth muscles of the gut, providing a spasmolytic effect [00:30:28].

### 14. Diuretic for Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
A female suffered a head injury with elevated ICP. Which diuretic is used? [00:30:37]

*   **Correct Answer:** Mannitol [00:31:02].
*   **Discussion:**
    *   For rapidly decreasing elevated intracranial pressure, **Mannitol** is the rapidly acting osmotic diuretic of choice [00:31:02].
    *   Acetazolamide, while it decreases CSF production, takes time to produce its effect and is not suitable for acute ICP management [00:30:57].
    *   Sometimes, Furosemide can be added for a rapid effect, but one must be careful with its side effects like hypokalemia [00:31:10].
    *   An important alternative to Mannitol that is gaining popularity is **Hypertonic Saline** [00:31:30].

## Key Takeaways for Future Aspirants

> [!TIP] Focus on Previous Year's Topics (PYTs)
> For those preparing for future exams like [[Strategies for NEETPG 2025 preparation | NEET PG 2025]], it's crucial to understand that very few questions (10-20%) are direct repeats of previous year's questions (PYQs) [00:32:03]. The majority are based on **Previous Year's Topics (PYTs)** [00:32:09].
>
> It is more effective to master the concepts and topics discussed in lectures, which are well-designed forms of PYTs, rather than simply memorizing PYQs [00:32:15]. While PYQs give a sense of question patterns, deep understanding of topics is key to solving new MCQs [00:32:33].

Success in competitive exams, such as the INI CET, is often a result of diligent [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation]] meeting opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Dr. Vinit, who achieved Rank 7 in the INI CET exam, shares his [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | strategies]] and insights for tackling these challenging medical competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overall Approach and Mindset

Dr. Vinit emphasizes the importance of focus and consistency throughout the [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation]] year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He maintained a structured schedule, dedicating significant time to his room for studying, taking tests, watching videos, and solving questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even during his internship, he utilized his time efficiently by solving questions on his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

His approach wasn't just about rote memorization; it involved understanding concepts and developing a "knack" for identifying correct answers, especially for tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Utilizing the Marrow Platform

Dr. Vinit began his [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]] with Marrow in his second year, after reading standard textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Video Lectures
While primarily a "notes guy," Dr. Vinit found certain video lectures particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He specifically praised Dr. Rohan Kandwal's surgery videos for their amazing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> and the radiology videos by Dr. Mayur Kulkarni for their animated conceptual explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. These conceptual videos were crucial for cracking tricky questions, especially in exams that moved beyond purely factual topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Qbank Strategy
Dr. Vinit considers Marrow's Qbank to be the best available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. He solved most of the Qbank during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. His key strategies included:
*   **Group Study**: He and his friends formed a group, setting a daily target of 100 MCQs. This peer pressure and motivation were essential for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Review**: He read the entire explanation for *every* question, not just the ones he got wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This thorough review took about two hours for 50 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Focus on Weaknesses**: Reviewing explanations helped him identify and work on his weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Dr. Vinit started taking Marrow's grand tests around June of the previous year, about a few months into his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: He aimed to give one GT every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Don't Wait for Perfection**: He began giving GTs even when he hadn't finished covering all subjects, particularly minor subjects and first/second-year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He stresses that there's no "ideal time" to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Post-Test Analysis**: This was a critical part of his [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | strategy]]. After a GT, he would spend a significant portion of the week reviewing all answers and their explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The explanations often covered entire topics, making them high-yield for future questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. He used this analysis to create flashcards for new concepts encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Revision Strategies

Dr. Vinit primarily relied on Marrow's revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Notes over Videos**: He didn't watch revision videos during his internship, preferring to focus on notes and the Qbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Concise Coverage**: The revision notes helped him cover a vast range of topics in a short, concise period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Timing**: He left high-yield subjects like anatomy and biochemistry for the very end of his [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]] cycle. This ensures the factual information remains fresh in mind just before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Advice for Aspirants

*   **Prioritize Revision**: "Nothing's better than [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Aim to complete all subjects at least once before the exam.
*   **Stay Calm During the Exam**: It's crucial to maintain composure during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Elimination Strategy**: Focus on figuring out why the *wrong* answers are wrong. Each option often provides a hint related to a specific disease or concept. By identifying what doesn't match, you can eliminate options and arrive at the correct answer, even if you're not immediately sure of the right one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Focus on Weaknesses**: Working on weaknesses strengthens your overall [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | preparation]] and improves exam performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Self-Worth**: Do not tie your self-worth to a rank. While luck plays a role, hard work is the primary driver of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Dr. Vinit's journey demonstrates that consistent effort, strategic use of resources, and a focused approach to weaknesses and revision are key pillars for excelling in competitive medical entrance exams.

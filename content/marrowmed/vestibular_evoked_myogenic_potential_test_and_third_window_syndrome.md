The [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) Test]] is a diagnostic tool used to assess the function of the inner ear and associated neural pathways, often employed in conditions such as [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Third Window Syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:49">[09:55:49]</a>.

## Third Window Syndrome

[[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Third Window Syndrome]] is characterized by an abnormal opening in the bone at the base of the skull, typically overlying the superior semicircular canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:03">[07:27:03]</a>.

### Symptoms and Presentation
Patients with [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Third Window Syndrome]] often present with difficulty hearing and [[differential_diagnosis_of_vertigo | vertigo]] that occurs only on loud sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:28">[05:28:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:12">[05:49:12]</a>.

Key symptoms include:
*   **Tullio's phenomenon**: [[differential_diagnosis_of_vertigo | Vertigo]] triggered by loud sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:04">[05:32:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:33">[09:37:33]</a>.
*   **Hennebert's sign**: [[differential_diagnosis_of_vertigo | Vertigo]] triggered by pressure changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:08">[09:43:08]</a>.
*   **Autophony**: Hearing one's own footsteps, eyeball movements, or voice excessively loudly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:30">[07:51:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:50">[07:52:50]</a>.
*   **Conductive Hearing Loss**: Despite being an inner ear pathology, patients experience conductive hearing loss. This is because bone conduction sounds are easily sensed by the inner ear, while air conduction sounds are lost through the abnormal opening before reaching the organ of Corti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:04">[07:57:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:17">[08:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Vertigo**: Loud sounds and pressure changes cause abnormal movement of the endolymph due to the abnormal communication, leading to excessive stimulation of the inner ear and [[differential_diagnosis_of_vertigo | vertigo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:11">[09:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:52">[09:24:52]</a>.

## Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) Test

The VEMP test measures vestibular-spinal and vestibular-collic reflexes, which are crucial for maintaining posture and gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:04">[09:59:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:21">[10:13:21]</a>. The inner ear has two primary functions: maintaining gaze movement via the vestibulo-ocular reflex and maintaining posture/gait via the vestibulocolic reflex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:43">[10:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:44">[10:08:44]</a>.

### Normal VEMP Response
A normal response to a very loud sound (e.g., 110 decibels) involves a sudden relaxation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to maintain posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:30">[10:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:09">[10:38:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This reflex pathway involves:
1.  Loud sound stimulating the saccule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:05">[11:07:05]</a>.
2.  Impulses traveling from the saccule via the inferior vestibular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:04">[11:18:04]</a>.
3.  Reaching the vestibular nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:15">[11:22:15]</a>.
4.  Transmitting through the vestibulospinal pathway to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle, causing sudden relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:30">[11:51:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

### Types of VEMP Tests
*   **Cervical VEMP (cVEMP)**: Records the relaxation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:56">[12:07:56]</a>. It primarily tests the inferior vestibular nerve pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:32">[16:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:24">[16:26:24]</a>.
*   **Ocular VEMP (oVEMP)**: Records the closing of the contralateral eye muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:30">[15:42:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. It is a vestibulo-ocular reflex and tests the superior vestibular nerve, starting from the utricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:45">[15:56:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:37">[16:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

### VEMP Findings
*   **Hyperactive Response**: Indicates excessive inner ear stimulation, showing a reduced threshold (response at lower decibels, e.g., 80 dB instead of 110 dB) and increased amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:58">[13:42:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:24">[17:42:24]</a>.
*   **Hypoactive Response**: Indicates nerve involvement (e.g., in [[vestibular_neuritis_and_head_impulse_test | vestibular neuritis]] or acoustic neuroma), showing an increased threshold, reduced amplitude, or no response at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

### Indications for VEMP
VEMP tests are performed when clinicians suspect:
*   Tullio's phenomenon or Hennebert's sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   Conditions causing inner ear hyperexcitability, such as [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Third Window Syndrome]], Meniere's disease (dilatation of utricle and saccule), hypermobile footplate of the stapes, or perilymphatic fistula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   To determine nerve involvement in acoustic neuroma or [[vestibular_neuritis_and_head_impulse_test | vestibular neuritis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:30">[17:17:30]</a>.

## VEMP and Third Window Syndrome
In the case of [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome|Third Window Syndrome]], the VEMP test shows a reduced threshold, meaning the inner ear is excessively stimulated by loud sounds even at lower intensities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:47">[13:04:47]</a>. This finding supports the diagnosis of a condition causing hyper-excitability of the inner ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

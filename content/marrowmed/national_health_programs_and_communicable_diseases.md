### RMNCH+A Strategy
The RMNCH+A strategy by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare aims to provide comprehensive healthcare across life stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
The target demography for the latest RMNCH+A includes:
*   Mother's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
*   Child health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
*   [[mother_and_child_health_programs_and_family_planning | Family planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
*   Adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>
Geriatric health is specifically excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The acronym RMNCH+A stands for:
*   **R**: Reproductive health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>
*   **M**: Maternal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>
*   **N**: Neonate/Newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>
*   **C**: Child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
*   **A**: Adolescent health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>
*   **N**: Nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> (which is a prime focus of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>)

### Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)
*   **Minimum Age for Consent**: The minimum age for consent by an individual for MTP is 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. For minor females or those not mentally competent, a legal guardian must give consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Doctor's Consent**: According to the MTP Amendment Act 2021 (revised 2022):
    *   Consent of two doctors is required for terminations between 20 to 24 weeks of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
    *   Below 20 weeks, only a single doctor's consent is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
    *   After 24 weeks, MTP can be performed only if approved by a state-level medical board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

### National AIDS Control Program
High-risk groups for HIV/AIDS include:
*   Female sex workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>
*   Males having sex with males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>
*   IV drug abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>
*   Transgender population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>

Bridge populations, which transfer infection from one point to another, include single male migrant laborers and long-distance truckers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Long-distance truckers are *not* considered a high-risk group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### [[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | National Program for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment]]
The current definition of blindness, according to this program, is "best corrected vision of less than 3/60 in the better eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>, which corresponds to a presenting visual acuity of less than 3/60 with available correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

## [[parasitic_and_viral_diseases | Communicable Diseases]]

### Malaria
*   **Clinical Cure**: Achieved primarily with Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) and Chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
    *   For *P. vivax*: Chloroquine (25 mg/kg over 3 days: Day 1 & 2: 10 mg/kg, Day 3: 5 mg/kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
    *   For *P. falciparum*: ACT (Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) in northeastern states, or Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) in other states) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Prevention of Relapse/Recurrence**: Primaquine is given for a longer period to prevent relapse of malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
    *   For *P. vivax*: Primaquine at 0.25 mg/kg for 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
    *   For *P. falciparum*: Primaquine at 0.75 mg/kg single dose on Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Cervical Cancer
High-risk HPV types, most commonly responsible for cervical cancer, are strains 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. Other high-risk types include 31, 33, and 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. Low-risk HPV types, like 6 and 11, are associated with other conditions such as genital warts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Vaccines and Immunodeficiency
In cases of immunosuppression (e.g., CD4 count less than 200 cells or relative CD4 count less than 15% of total T-helper cells), live vaccines are contraindicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

*   **Live Vaccines**: MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Other Vaccines**:
    *   Hepatitis B: Recombinant vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
    *   Diphtheria and Tetanus (DT): Toxoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
    *   IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine/Salk strain): Killed vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

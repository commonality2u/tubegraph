From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

Dr. Narendra, a second-year Radiology resident at AIIMS, successfully cleared both the INI-CET and FMG exams, attributing his success to the strategic [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | utilization of educational resources]] provided by Marrow. His unique approach involved integrating video lectures with study materials and practice questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Early Engagement with Marrow Videos

Dr. Narendra began using Marrow during his final year of MBBS, expressing regret that he did not start earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He initially focused on four major subjects: Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | video lectures]] were primarily used for his final year university examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, with some also completed for community medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Depth and Clarity of Video Lectures

Marrow's regular videos are known for their depth and clarity, simplifying complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Dr. Narendra believes that delving deeper into medical subjects leads to a better understanding, making them easier to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This in-depth approach is considered "unbeatable" and helps build a strong conceptual grip, aiding recall for MCQ exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | video lectures]] were beneficial for both theory and practical exams in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Integration of Clinical and Pre/Paraclinical Subjects
The major clinical subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBG, Pediatrics) covered in the final year have significant overlap with pre- and paraclinical subjects like Pharmacology, Pathology, Physiology, Microbiology, and Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Thoroughly understanding these clinical subjects through videos also helps in comprehending the integrated nature of questions in modern exams, which often include clinical hints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Questions today are not isolated by subject but are integrated across various disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Complementary Role of Question Bank (Q Bank)

Dr. Narendra integrated the Q Bank with his video lecture study. His strategy involved completing a video and then immediately attempting questions related to that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The Q Bank helps to fill gaps in knowledge and identifies specific points within the video content that are frequently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

> "The video basically gives you a complete story and you will not be able to understand which part of the stories are usually tested are important for your exam and when you do the question bank it's like a net that you put on your story which highlights and identifies the important areas that are frequently tested on your exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

## Integrated Notes Strategy

For note-taking, Dr. Narendra utilized Marrow's printed notes, finding them "very good" and beautifully integrated with the video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This approach saved time from creating personal notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The notes process the video information into a simplified manner, with ample space for adding extra details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This aligns with [[effective_notetaking_and_study_techniques | effective notetaking and study techniques]] that emphasize leveraging pre-existing organized resources.

## Revision Modules for Efficient Study

For short subjects, especially before the INI-CET exam, Dr. Narendra relied on Marrow's revision videos and their corresponding notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Having only 1.5 months to prepare these subjects, the revision videos were crucial for efficient learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This demonstrates the [[utilizing_video_lectures_and_revision_modules_for_efficient_study | advantages of video learning over textbooks]] for targeted and time-constrained preparation, and highlights the utility of [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revision techniques and managing study notes]].

## Grand Tests for Performance Analysis

Grand Tests are considered essential for assessing one's level of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Dr. Narendra found that his Grand Test scores correlated closely with his actual INI-CET exam marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The analytics provided by these tests effectively identify weak and strong subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For instance, a Grand Test helped him realize his weakness in minor subjects, leading him to specifically prepare them using revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Building Strong Basics for All Exams

Dr. Narendra advises that the best preparation for exams like FMG and INI-CET is to study properly from the beginning of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. For those in later stages, platforms like Marrow offer an "amazing opportunity" to gain comprehensive knowledge, irrespective of logistical limitations or patient exposure at their institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The core recommendation is to "always build on the basics" with a detailed understanding, which is where [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | Marrow videos]] excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Attempting to use shortcut resources for high scores is cautioned against, as depth and clarity require patience and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The FMG exam, in particular, is seen as testing fundamental MBBS knowledge and clinical readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Preparing in depth for one exam will ultimately aid preparation for all others, as the underlying knowledge base and platforms remain similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

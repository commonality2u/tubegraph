Successfully navigating medical education and clearing competitive exams like the FMG requires strategic time and resource management. Dr. Shia Gandhi, who cleared the FMG exam on his first attempt with a score of 244, shares his insights on how to optimize study habits and resource utilization, emphasizing early preparation and consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Starting Early and Choosing Resources

A crucial piece of advice for aspiring medical professionals is to [[effective_study_strategies_for_firstyear_mbbs_students | start early]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Dr. Shia began using Marrow towards the end of his third year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This long-term engagement allowed him to thoroughly cover the extensive syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

Choosing the right resources is also paramount. Dr. Shia strongly advocates for sticking with a single, comprehensive platform like Marrow, trusting its faculty and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He found that Marrow's videos, notes, and question banks were sufficient for exam preparation, even for higher-level exams like INICET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow Video Lectures Effectively

Dr. Shia's approach to video lectures was tailored based on the subject's importance and question weight in the exam:

*   **Main Videos for Major Subjects**: For subjects with a high question quantity or significant clinical importance, such as Pathology, Obs and Gyn, Surgery, Ophtha, and ENT, he diligently watched all the main video lectures from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos for Shorter/Minor Subjects**: For subjects with fewer questions (e.g., 5-10 questions), he utilized the revision videos, which he found "absolutely fantastic" for their concise yet comprehensive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This strategy allowed him to gain 90% accuracy on questions from these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He emphasized multiple revisions of these videos to ensure perfect recall of every detail, making them highly scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Note-Taking and Revision Strategy

Dr. Shia opted for Marrow's ready-made printed notes instead of making his own, stating he was "little lazy in that part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. His strategy involved:

*   **Active Reading and Marking**: In his fourth and fifth years, when he had ample time, he would read the notes cover to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Later, he began marking specific areas in the main notes that were frequently tested in questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Focused Revision**: During revisions, he would navigate directly to these marked "important" areas within the main notes, saving time and ensuring a targeted review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. He continued to use the main notes until the very end of his preparation, relying on multiple revisions to internalize the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This thorough approach provided him with a crucial "sense of completion" and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Mastering Questions and Grand Tests

Becoming familiar with question patterns is vital for exam success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

*   **Question Bank Approach**: Dr. Shia's general flow was videos -> notes -> question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   **NEET PG Focus (Initially)**: Until October-November 2024, he focused on NEET PG and AIIMS questions, building a strong conceptual foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **FMG Custom Modules (Later)**: Closer to the FMG exam, he shifted to the FMG section of the question bank and extensively used custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. He used hashtags like #NEET, #FMG, #Clinical, and #MostCommons to create targeted modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   **Previous Year Papers**: He solved previous year papers multiple times, even when he knew the answers, to ensure reflex-like recall and save time on the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   **Custom Module Mix**: Initially, he used custom modules for single subjects to achieve 85-90% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Later, he mixed multiple subjects in custom modules to prevent subject bias and prepare for varied questions on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   **Quantity of Questions**: He estimates solving around 10,000-12,000 questions throughout his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This extensive practice, rather than just numerous Grand Tests, was key to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Grand Test Strategy**: Many students hesitate to take Grand Tests (GTs) due to fear of low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Dr. Shia's approach differed:
    *   **Delayed Start**: He started giving GTs in September, after having a solid knowledge base (completing around 15-16 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This ensured that his scores were a true evaluation of his preparation, avoiding demotivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Frequency**: He gave around five to six GTs in total, approximately once a month as he completed revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   **Post-GT Analysis**: After each GT, he diligently reviewed the analytics to identify weak areas and silly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. PSM was one such subject he continuously worked on due to its vast information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   **Reviewing Questions**: He first reviewed all wrong questions, bookmarking important ones or noting down points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. He also briefly reviewed correct questions to confirm his thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## [[Time Management and scheduling study sessions | Daily Study Habits]] and [[Balancing academics and personal life in medicine | Well-being]]

[[Balancing study and leisure during medical studies | Balancing study]] with other commitments is a common challenge for medical students, especially those studying abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Dr. Shia suggests a flexible approach to [[time_management_skills_during_exams | time management]]:

*   **Consistency is Key**: Dedicate at least an hour daily for revision or solving questions, even on busy days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. On freer days, invest more hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The goal is to avoid skipping days unless feeling overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Rest and Breaks**: Take a day off if feeling overwhelmed, perhaps once a week or every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Study Partner**: Finding a good study partner can make the journey significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Ultimately, Dr. Shia's journey highlights the importance of starting early, selecting reliable resources, a structured approach to learning and revision, consistent question practice, and smart [[integration_and_time_management_in_medical_exams | time management]] to achieve success in medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

[[sexually_transmitted_diseases | Sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) are a significant topic in dermatology, with specific focus on conditions like urethritis and bacterial vaginosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Urethritis
Urethritis is defined as the inflammation of the urethra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It is broadly categorized into two types:
*   **Gonococcal Urethritis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>: This type is produced by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Non-gonococcal Urethritis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>: The most common organism causing non-gonococcal urethritis is *Chlamydia trachomatis* (specifically biovar D-K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Other organisms include:
    *   *Ureaplasma urealyticum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
    *   *Mycoplasma genitalium* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
    *   *Trichomonas vaginalis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> (which can also produce non-gonococcal urethritis in addition to vaginal discharge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>

## Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis is a disease caused by *Gardnerella vaginalis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. It is characterized by an altered vaginal microflora, meaning there is a decrease in *Lactobacillus* species and an increase in anaerobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Partner treatment is generally not required for bacterial vaginosis because it is primarily an alteration of the vaginal microflora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis
Diagnosis typically involves assessing specific criteria, including the Whiff test and Amsel's criteria.

#### Whiff Test
The Whiff test, also known as the amine test, is performed by taking vaginal discharge on a glass slide and adding one to two drops of potassium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In bacterial vaginosis, this process liberates volatile amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which produce a characteristic fishy odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

#### Amsel's Criteria
Amsel's criteria consist of four points, with at least three needing to be positive for a correct diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>:
1.  Homogeneous, white, adherent vaginal discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
2.  Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
3.  Presence of "clue cells," which are vaginal epithelial cells with a stippled appearance, completely covered by *Gardnerella vaginalis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. More than 20% of the cells should be clue cells on a wet mount examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
4.  Positive Whiff test (amine test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

Endemic [[fungal_and_bacterial_infections | fungal atypical pneumonia]] is caused by five specific [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | fungi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | fungi]] are all [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | dimorphic fungi]], meaning they exist in both yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Fungi Causing Endemic Fungal Atypical Pneumonia

The five [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | fungi]] responsible for endemic [[fungal_and_bacterial_infections | fungal atypical pneumonia]] are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

*   *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### General Characteristics

All five of these [[dimorphic_fungi_and_associated_symptoms | fungi]] cause [[clinical_manifestations_of_atypical_pneumonia_caused_by_fungi | atypical pneumonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### [[Clinical manifestations of atypical pneumonia caused by fungi | Clinical Manifestations]]

The [[clinical_manifestations_of_atypical_pneumonia_caused_by_fungi | clinical presentation]] for all five fungi is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[Treatment for fungal atypical pneumonia | Treatment]]

The [[treatment_for_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | treatment]] for all five fungi is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>:

### Lab Diagnosis

While the [[clinical_manifestations_of_atypical_pneumonia_caused_by_fungi | clinical presentation]] and [[treatment_for_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | treatment]] are consistent, the fungi differ in their lab diagnosis, specifically the appearance of their yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

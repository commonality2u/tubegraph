[[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | Marasmus]] is a standard and important topic in pediatrics that was featured in the INIC May 2025 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Metabolic Characteristics
[[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | Marasmus]] is primarily characterized by a severe calorie deficit, while typically maintaining normal serum protein levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This distinguishes it from Kwashiorkor, which is marked by edema due to severe protein deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Hormonal and Catabolic Responses
The metabolic state of [[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | marasmus]] involves several key changes:
*   **Insulin Levels** Due to chronic starvation and low glucose availability, insulin levels in the body actually decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Lipolysis** The body increases lipolysis to mobilize available fat stores and convert them into energy for bodily functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Nitrogen Balance** There is a negative nitrogen balance in [[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | marasmus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This occurs because muscle proteins are broken down for energy generation, and the nitrogen released during this process is excreted in the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Cortisol Levels** In response to chronic stress and starvation, cortisol levels are increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

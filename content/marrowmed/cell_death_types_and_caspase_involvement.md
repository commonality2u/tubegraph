Dr. Leela Jain Khandelwal presented a module reviewing [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam|pathology questions]] from the INICET May exam, which was characterized by its moderate to severe difficulty and conceptual nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Pathology questions, numbering 15 to 20, predominantly covered General and Systemic Pathology, with a notable decrease in Hematology-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While topics were frequently revisited, the questions themselves were not direct repetitions from previous exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Cell Death Pathways

A key question in the exam focused on different types of cell death and their association with caspases and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The options provided included necroptosis, pyroptosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Necroptosis
Necroptosis is a form of cell death that combines features of both necrosis and apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Its morphological characteristics resemble necrosis, but its underlying mechanism is similar to apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Notably, necroptosis is **caspase-independent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The proteins involved in this pathway are RIP1 and RIP3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Therefore, caspase-1 is not involved in necroptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Pyroptosis
Pyroptosis is a type of cell death that is associated with inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It involves the activation of interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is linked to pyrexia (fever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A defining characteristic of pyroptosis is the involvement of **caspase-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Apoptosis
Apoptosis is a highly regulated form of programmed cell death. It involves specific caspases, which are categorized into two main types:
*   **Initiator caspases**: Caspase-8 and caspase-9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Executor caspases**: Caspase-3 and caspase-6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
Caspase-1 is not involved in apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Ferroptosis
Ferroptosis is one of the more recently identified types of cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Its name, derived from "ferrous" (iron), indicates its association with increased iron levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This cell death pathway is notable because it does **not involve caspases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

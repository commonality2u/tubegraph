[[ketamine_as_a_rapid-onset_antidepressant | Ketamine]] is a psychoactive drug and anesthetic agent that has found significant use in psychiatry, particularly for its rapid antidepressant effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Psychiatric Applications
[[ketamine_as_a_rapid-onset_antidepressant | Ketamine]] is considered extremely useful in the treatment of:
*   **Treatment-resistant depression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>
*   Patients with **suicidal ideation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, where immediate quick effect is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   Situations requiring **immediate mood uplift** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

It is now considered a very important drug treatment strategy for its antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Rapid Onset of Action
One of the most significant advantages of [[ketamine_as_a_rapid-onset_antidepressant | Ketamine]] is its very fast onset of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Its antidepressant effects can be observed within a few hours of intravenous (IV) administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional antidepressants like SSRIs, which typically take 2 to 3 weeks to show effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This rapid effect allows clinicians to "buy time" in highly suicidal patients until standard antidepressants begin to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Dosage and Administration
While [[ketamine_as_a_rapid-onset_antidepressant | Ketamine]] is known as an anesthetic agent, its psychiatric use involves significantly lower doses:
*   **Anesthetic dose:** Typically 2 to 3 mg per kg body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Psychiatric dose:** A sub-anesthetic dose of 0.5 mg per kg body weight is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This dose is given as an IV infusion over 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The much smaller dosage reduces concerns about the need for specialized [[use_of_anesthetic_equipment_in_clinical_practice | anesthetic]] oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

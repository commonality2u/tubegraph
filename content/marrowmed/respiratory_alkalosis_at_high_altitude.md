Rapid ascent to high altitude typically results in respiratory alkalosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This condition primarily affects individuals new to high-altitude environments, as those living there for extended periods usually become acclimatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Pathophysiology

The process begins with hypoxia, which is the initial physiological challenge at high altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. To compensate for this hypoxia, the body activates peripheral chemoreceptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This activation stimulates increased ventilation, leading to hyperventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Hyperventilation causes a "washout" of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This results in a fall in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and a corresponding decrease in hydrogen ion (H+) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The decrease in H+ leads to alkalosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Since the cause of this alkalosis originates in the lungs due to altered ventilation, it is termed respiratory alkalosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Consequences

A significant consequence of respiratory alkalosis is its effect on calcium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Hydrogen ions (H+) and calcium compete for binding sites on albumin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. When H+ levels are low (as in respiratory alkalosis), more calcium binds to albumin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This increases the amount of calcium bound to albumin, while concurrently decreasing the free (active) form of calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This reduction in free calcium can lead to hypocalcemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Patients experiencing hypocalcemia are more susceptible to tetany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

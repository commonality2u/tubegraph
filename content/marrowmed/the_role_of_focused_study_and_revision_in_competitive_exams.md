Dr. Akhil Tambi, who achieved an All India Rank 6 in the November INI CET 2024, shares his strategies on the importance of focused study and revision for competitive medical exams like NEET PG and INI CET. His journey emphasizes consistent effort and a structured approach to preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Starting Early and Building a Strong Foundation
Dr. Akhil's preparation began in his third year of MBBS, following advice from seniors who recommended starting with Marrow from the third year itself to build notes and begin reading with a NEET PG orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He suggests that while the first and second years can be for enjoyment, concept building should ideally start from the end of the second year or fifth semester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. The second-year subjects, such as Pathology, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, are considered "most crucial" and essential to strengthen, as they form the foundation for future years of MBBS and are critical for exam success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Subjects and Note-Making
Dr. Akhil's [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | exam strategy]] involved starting with video lectures for subjects like ENT, Ophthalmology, and PSM, making notes, and then immediately solving question banks for those specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. By the end of the third year, he began studying major final-year subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, and Gynaecology to build foundational concepts necessary for clinical postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

He prioritized major subjects (Pathology, Pharmacology, Microbiology, Medicine, Surgery, Ob/Gynae) as they are "interrelated" and "decide your rank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. For short subjects, he advises against spending too much time, recommending they be completed in "as short a time as you can" and focusing on their previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

For notes, he created handwritten notes for shorter subjects (like ENT, Ophthalmology) and used printed notes for larger subjects (Ob/Gynae, Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. His approach to notes was dynamic:
*   He would solve questions and refer to main notes only when he felt a "lacking in this particular concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   He added points from previous year questions, one-liners, or confusing concepts directly into his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   The goal was to have "everything for the last moment revision... in one place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

## Selective Revision and Question Practice
A key aspect of Dr. Akhil's [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | revision strategy]] was selective reading:
> "I used to read selectively like the topics after the first read you come to know that yes these topics are important these are less important so the important ones you go and study and then memorize and do all the things but for the topics which are not asked so you just flip Through them that okay if something comes then yes I know one word so I can do this also by thinking and applying logic during the exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>

He found the "Custom Module" feature of Marrow to be the "best thing" as it allowed solving questions anytime, even during hectic internship duties, ensuring that "my whole day is not wasted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This feature provided the flexibility to customize [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_revision | preparation]] according to specific needs, focusing on previous year questions (NEET, AIIMS), clinical tags, and image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Bookmarks
Initially, Dr. Akhil extensively used the bookmark feature, accumulating over 900 bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. He later regretted this due to the overwhelming number and difficulty in filtering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. His advice to juniors:
> "Bookmark, you should not do bookmark in first grade, the big mistake I did was that... I started bookmarking from the third year, so that I feel that was my mistake that from the third year onwards I have so many book marks... You have to do book marks selectively after your first read. When you get to know what are important, what are your weak areas, only bookmark them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>

He emphasized the importance of mastering previous year topics and developing the courage to "leave it" if a topic is not important, not in notes, or not asked previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. The core principle: it's not about how much you read, but "how much you remember, how much you can revise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.

### The Role of Revision Videos
Dr. Akhil stressed the [[importance_of_revision_for_neetpg_and_ini_exams | importance of revision]] videos, especially when time is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. While main notes are crucial for professional exams in third and final years, revision notes/videos become vital closer to competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. He advises using revision videos from the *same faculty* as the main videos to maintain synchrony and avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. This approach helps to condense and highlight important, forgettable points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

> "Trust your source and stick to one source because if you are in one place they will come out in 10 different places or even wasting your time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>

## Grand Tests and Performance Improvement
Dr. Akhil started giving Grand Tests (GTs) during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. His review strategy focused on correcting wrong answers first, believing that mistakes are highly likely to be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. He used GT results to identify weak topics, which he would then revise from his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

He acknowledges that [[overcoming_challenges_and_improving_performance_in_competitive_exams | performance]] in GTs is a "roller coaster ride," with scores fluctuating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. Despite dips in confidence, the [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | main thing is consistency with efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. Even if feeling unprepared, he advises giving GTs or subject-wise tests consistently, as they are a "main factor" in deciding exam day rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. Giving a GT itself forces a "tremendous" increase in preparation and revision before the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>. Regularly giving GTs means [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | constantly revising all 19 subjects]], maintaining connection to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.

> "Your mind starts playing games with you that yaar chodo koi baat nahi next GT denge next GT and it only gets postponed next next next so you have to just tell your mind to know every time there is a GT I have to give" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>

## Final Advice: The "Triage" System of Preparation
Dr. Akhil recommends a systematic, three-stage approach to [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | preparation]]:

1.  **First Read (Topic-wise):** Read notes for each topic and solve its specific previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>. Identify weak areas, refer back to notes, highlight mistakes, and focus on these highlighted parts during subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Second Cycle (Subject-wise):** Solve previous year question papers for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. Review mistakes and solve subject-wise custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>. This stage also helps identify which subjects need more revision based on custom module performance (e.g., if more than 75% correct, less revision needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Final Cycle (Overall/GTs):** Engage in full-fledged Grand Tests (GTs) covering all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>. This builds confidence, reinforcing knowledge gained from topic-wise and subject-wise study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.

> "You have to be very clear in your paper if you do anything randomly then you will not know what is your strong point, what you have to do next, what you do not have to do so go systematically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>

Ultimately, Dr. Akhil's experience underscores that consistent effort, selective studying, and structured revision, particularly through repeated testing, are paramount for success in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.

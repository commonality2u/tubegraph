Corneal opacities are categorized into three main types based on their density and visibility of underlying structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The term "macular opacity" refers to a type of corneal opacity, not the macula of the retina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

#### Easy to Remember
The three classifications can be remembered in alphabetical order: Leukoma, Macular, and Nebular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Types of Corneal Opacities

### Nebular Corneal Opacity
*   **Description**: This is the faintest type of opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: Due to its faintness, it allows for visibility of structures behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Both macro details, such as the pupillary margin, and microscopic details, like the iris structure, can be seen through a nebular opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Visual Impact**: It causes maximum visual distortion because it allows light to pass through, leading to diffraction of light rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Macular Corneal Opacity
*   **Description**: This is an intermediate opacity, denser than nebular but less dense than leukoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: While the macroscopic detail of the pupillary margin is still visible, the microscopic details of the iris structure are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Leukoma
*   **Description**: This is the densest and most opaque type of corneal opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The name "leukoma" itself signifies its white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: No details behind the cornea, including both the iris and pupillary margin, are visible through a leukoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Visual Impact**: It results in maximum visual loss, often leading to no vision, due to its complete density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

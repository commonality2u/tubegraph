Dr. Trupti's Journey to INICET Rank 1

Dr. Trupti secured Rank 1 in the recently conducted INICET exam [00:00:12]. This achievement followed a significant [[journey_and_strategy_for_inicet_preparation | journey]] from a NEETPG rank of 19,000 the previous year [00:00:52].

### Early Preparation and Foundations
Dr. Trupti began her [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | journey]] with Marrow as a plan subscriber in her third year of MBBS [00:01:17]. Initially, she focused on watching Marrow videos to gain clarity, supplementing them with textbooks [00:02:31]. She primarily relied on Marrow's printed notes, adding her own points to them [00:01:55]. During her third and fourth years, she did not use the Qbank [00:02:55], focusing instead on theoretical understanding [00:02:57]. For weaker subjects like Surgery, her approach was to solve "more questions as much as possible" [00:03:13]. She referred to Indian standard textbooks such as SRB for Surgery and Ramza snip for Medicine [00:19:15].

### Post-Internship and NEETPG Performance
After her internship, which she described as heavy, Dr. Trupti started giving Grand Tests (GTs) [00:04:19]. Initially, she gave GTs once a month for a few months, increasing the frequency to once every 15 days after acquiring sufficient knowledge [00:04:51]. She did not have a specific [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation]] for the NEETPG exam, having only covered about 10 or 11 subjects by then [00:10:30]. She was "okay with the rank" of 19,000 in NEETPG because she understood that she could perform better if she covered all subjects [00:10:28].

### The Turning Point: November INICET (Rank 115)
The November INICET exam, where she secured a rank of 115, served as a "major rank confidence booster" [00:10:46]. Despite this good rank, she decided to attempt the exam again as she wanted to pursue medicine in a central institute [00:07:17]. Her parents' support was instrumental in this decision [00:08:46]. She also noted that she was not fatigued from the November exam because she had not initially aimed for it [00:08:59].

### Refined Strategy for May INICET (Rank 1)
Between November INICET and May INICET, Dr. Trupti further refined her [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | strategy]]:
*   **GT Frequency**: She increased the frequency of her GTs from once every 15 days to once a week [00:11:12].
*   **Question Volume**: She increased her daily question solving to 100 questions per day on average, sometimes more for shorter subjects [00:11:17].
*   **GT Review**: To address plateauing GT scores, she devised a "GT book" in the last two to three months before the exam [00:05:19]. This small notebook contained mistakes from topics she had already studied [00:05:43]. She made it a point to review the GT on the same day it was taken [00:06:06]. Her review process involved starting from her weakest subject, quickly going through correct answers, and reading incorrect answers in detail to add to her notebook [00:06:19].
*   **Revision Strategy**: For the last month leading up to the exam, particularly the last 20 days, she divided her time to cover all subjects once [00:11:45]. In the final five days, she focused on a fast review of highlighted points in her notes to remember facts closer to the exam [00:11:53]. She emphasized that this visual impression provided significant confidence [00:12:23].
*   **Custom Modules**: She utilized Marrow's custom modules regularly [00:13:57]. When preparing custom modules, she would select PYQs from the question modules first [00:14:25], and then use tags like "NEET AIMS," "Clinical questions," and "Image-based" [00:14:37]. She included "all difficulty levels" in her custom modules [00:14:56]. She did not set a target number of correct answers for these modules to avoid feeling discouraged by new questions [00:15:12]. She bookmarked questions she got wrong and revisited them using the hashtag feature in the last few days [00:15:28].

### Exam Experience and Future Plans
In the May INICET exam, Dr. Trupti attempted the complete paper [00:12:37]. She assessed the paper as slightly tougher than the November INICET, noting the presence of many multiple-correct type questions and tricky options, even though the topics were repeated [00:12:45]. Her mock test rank before the INICET exam was between 30 and 40, which she was happy with [00:17:42].
Her future plan is to pursue Medicine at AIIMS Delhi or possibly other AIIMS [00:18:01].

### Advice for Aspiring Students
Dr. Trupti shared several key pieces of advice, especially for those considering a drop year or starting their [[strategies_for_neetpg_2025_preparation | preparation]]:
*   **Acceptance**: The faster one accepts their previous results, the better they can perform in the subsequent attempt [00:16:37].
*   **Consistent Reading**: Read consistently [00:19:55].
*   **Clinical Practice**: Follow clinics, as it is "very important" [00:20:02].
*   **Internship Sincerity**: Work sincerely during internship, as it makes a huge difference [00:20:06].
*   **Early GTs**: Start giving GTs "as early as possible" once exam [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | preparation]] begins, rather than waiting for the entire course to finish [00:20:19].
*   **Textbooks**: Supplement Marrow videos with Indian standard textbooks [00:19:46].
*   **Marrow Features**: Make extensive use of Marrow's custom modules [00:17:28].

Dr. Trupti's [[skills_required_to_succeed_in_neet_pg_exams | journey]] highlights the [[importance_of_revision_for_neetpg_and_ini_exams | importance of revision]], strategic GT analysis, and a resilient mindset in achieving top ranks in competitive medical entrance exams like [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | INICET]].

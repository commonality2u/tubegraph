## Treatment Phases

Initially, the primary goal is to alleviate [[drug_withdrawal_effects_and_management | drug withdrawal effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is typically achieved using maintenance therapy drugs that help manage the physical and psychological effects of withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

The drugs of choice for this phase include:
*   **Buprenorphine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   **Methadone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

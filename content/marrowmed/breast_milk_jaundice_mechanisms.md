[[breast_milk_jaundice_in_neonates | Breast milk jaundice]] is a topic frequently examined, with different aspects being questioned in recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. It is generally a late-onset jaundice, typically presenting beyond three to four weeks after birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:21">[03:18:21]</a>. It is considered a benign condition, and interruption of breastfeeding is seldom required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:02">[04:28:02]</a>.

## Proposed Mechanisms

While the exact reasons for [[breast_milk_jaundice_in_neonates | breast milk jaundice]] are not clearly understood, several theories have been proposed:

### 1. High Free Fatty Acid Concentration
Breast milk is believed to contain substances that can predispose to jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>. One such substance is a high concentration of free fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. This high free fatty acid concentration is thought to inhibit the conjugation of bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. This inhibition leads to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin levels, resulting in jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>.

### 2. Beta-Glucuronidase Activity
Another proposed theory involves the presence of beta-glucuronidase activity in breast milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a>. This enzyme causes the deconjugation of bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:04">[04:03:04]</a>. Deconjugation means converting conjugated bilirubin back into unconjugated bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:44">[04:07:44]</a>. Similar to the fatty acid mechanism, this process also results in increased unconjugated bilirubin levels and subsequently, jaundice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:16">[04:17:16]</a>.

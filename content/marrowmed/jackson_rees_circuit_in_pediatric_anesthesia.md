The Jackson Rees circuit is a specific type of [[anesthesia_breathing_circuits | anesthesia breathing circuit]] primarily used in [[use_of_anesthetic_equipment_in_clinical_practice | clinical practice]] for pediatric anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This circuit was a straightforward question in the [[anaesthesia_questions_in_inicet_nov_24 | INI CET November session]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, reflecting its importance in the field.

### Classification and Naming
The Jackson Rees circuit is also known as the Mapleson F circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is considered a modification of the Mapleson E circuit, which itself is referred to as IR TPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The Mapleson E circuit forms the basis for the construction of ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Application
The primary indication for the Jackson Rees circuit is in pediatric anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, making it the circuit of choice for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Historical Context
Historically, questions regarding [[anesthesia_breathing_circuits | anesthesia breathing circuits]] were not very common in examinations for undergraduate levels, especially complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The question about the Jackson Rees circuit marks a return to circuits after an absence of about four to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Previous questions on circuits were generally straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) is a crucial diagnostic tool in assessing arterial health, particularly in the lower limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>.

## Definition and Calculation
ABPI stands for Ankle Brachial Pressure Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. It is calculated using the following formula:
> Maximum systolic BP at ankle / Maximum systolic BP in brachial artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>

## Clinical Interpretation
The interpretation of ABPI values is based on the latest edition of Bailey's medical textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>.

### Normal Values
*   A normal ABPI ranges from 0.9 to 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[04:53]</a>.
*   In healthy individuals, the ABPI tends to increase post-exercise because increased muscle bulk in the lower limbs leads to greater blood flow and arterial pressure compared to the upper limbs during exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>.

### Abnormal Values and Associated Conditions
*   **Less than 0.9**: Indicates the presence of [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | intermittent claudication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58">[04:58]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.4**: Suggests [[Chronic and Acute Arterial Occlusion | chronic limb-threatening ischemia]] (CLTI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>.
    *   CLTI is characterized by rest pain, with or without ulceration or gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.5**: Patients with an ABPI below 0.5 are twice as likely to experience faster clinical deterioration compared to those with values above 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23">[06:23]</a>.
*   **Gradually decreasing ABPI**: A sign of imminent limb loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.
*   **Post-exercise fall**: In patients with a suspected arterial block, ABPI values will fall after exercise, which helps differentiate them from normal individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48">[06:48]</a>.

### Cardiac Mortality Risk
ABPI values also provide insights into cardiac mortality risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54">[06:54]</a>. For every 0.1 decrease in ABPI below 0.9, the cardiac mortality risk increases by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>.

## Special Considerations: Falsely High ABPI
In certain patient populations, such as those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, a falsely high ABPI (greater than 1.4) may be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>. This occurs due to calcified vessels, which are rigid and lead to an inaccurately high pressure reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>. A falsely high ABPI can mislead clinicians into thinking the patient is normal and has no arterial block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">[07:50]</a>.

### Role of Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI)
To overcome the limitation of falsely high ABPI, the Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI) is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17">[07:17]</a>. Digital arteries are rarely affected by sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04">[08:04]</a>. Therefore, TBPI, when correlated with ABPI, is a more reliable indicator of vascular disease in diabetic patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10">[08:10]</a>.

*   In diabetic patients, if the ABPI is falsely high (e.g., >1.4), a TBPI of less than 0.6 can still indicate a significant arterial lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23">[08:23]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of using TBPI in conjunction with ABPI in suspected cases, especially in diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37">[08:37]</a>.

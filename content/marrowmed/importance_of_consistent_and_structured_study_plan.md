Dr. Jasurya, who secured Rank 5 in the May 2025 INIC exam, credits his success to a [[role_of_standard_and_thorough_preparation_for_exams | standard and thorough preparation]] and a consistent, structured approach to his studies, primarily utilizing Marrow as his sole resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. His journey highlights the significance of building a strong foundation, strategic use of study materials, and diligent practice.

## Early Foundation and Consistent Engagement

Jasurya's initial exposure to Marrow began in his third year of MBBS, when he opted for a two-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He used Marrow lectures to understand subjects and supplement his college lessons for about one to one and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This early and consistent engagement built a "good base" and a "sound knowledge base" during his third and fourth years, which proved helpful even for his professional exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Starting early is a key takeaway, allowing students to watch videos and build a strong foundation from the best teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

## Focused Preparation with Marrow Resources

After a brief break from Indian exams, Jasurya fully committed to INIC and NEET PG about eight months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. With an existing strong foundation, his strategy shifted to a more focused approach:
*   **Main Notes:** His primary source of preparation was the main notes of Marrow, which he read to reinforce topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. He did not add information from videos or question banks to his notes, preferring to keep them separate for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Question Bank (QBank):** He solved relevant QBank modules simultaneously with reading notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The QBank helped him apply knowledge, understand question framing, identify trick words, and condense his main notes by highlighting high-yield questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. He completed about 80% of the QBank modules (669 modules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** Jasurya emphasized the importance of PYQs, completing them twice before the INIC exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. He bookmarked all the PYQ questions he got wrong for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Consistent Grand Tests (GTs) and Analytics

A crucial aspect of Jasurya's strategy was his unwavering [[the_impact_of_consistent_practice_tests_on_exam_performance | consistency]] with Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. He started giving proper GTs six months before the actual exam, after finishing around 50% of the syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Regularity:** He was "very regular" with GTs, taking one every 10 or 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | consistent practice]] was a game-changer, providing an objective measure of his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   **Serious Approach:** He approached GTs like the main exam, focusing intensely for the entire duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
*   **Systematic Review:**
    *   Initially, due to burnout, he would review 20 questions a day, completing the 200 questions of a GT over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. He would check why he got questions right (e.g., guessing) to ensure thorough understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
    *   Towards the end, with time constraints, he reviewed only the questions he got wrong on the same day he took the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   **Score Improvement:** His scores steadily improved from 136 correct with a rank of 300-400 initially, to 150-155 after first revision, and then consistently 165-175 in the last five-six exams, reflecting a top 20 rank at his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Adapting the Strategy for Improvement

Jasurya emphasized that growth is not linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. To overcome plateaus in his GT scores, he strategically used the GT analytics provided by Marrow. He would identify the five subjects he performed worst in and dedicate the next 10-15 days to studying those subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. This targeted [[the_role_of_focused_study_and_revision_in_competitive_exams | focused study]] consistently helped him improve his score by a few questions in the subsequent GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

Jasurya's success underscores several vital aspects of a structured and consistent study plan:
*   **Early Start:** Begin preparation in the second or third year to build a strong foundational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.
*   **One Resource, Done Well:** Focus on one comprehensive resource and revise it multiple times for higher yield, rather than superficially covering many resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Learning:** Combine notes and question bank practice simultaneously to apply knowledge and identify weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_consistent_study_habits_for_fmge | Regular Grand Tests]]:** Be disciplined and consistent with mock exams and GTs, treating them like the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.
*   **Utilize Analytics:** Thoroughly review GT analytics to identify weak subjects and [[time_management_and_scheduling_study_sessions | allocate time]] to improve them, knowing that scores will improve gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Strength:** Stay focused on your own strategy and do not get swayed by what others are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

This article outlines the [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | study and revision techniques]] and [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | exam strategy and mindset]] employed by Dr. Trupi, who secured Rank 1 in the INICET exam after previously achieving a rank of 19,000 in NEET PG and 115 in a subsequent INICET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Her [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy]] highlights consistent effort and strategic adjustments over time.

## Early Preparation During MBBS

Dr. Trupi's [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy]] with Marrow began in her third year of MBBS, where she was a Plan C subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Video Lectures**: She watched most of the subject videos to gain clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Notes**: Primarily relied on Marrow's printed notes, supplementing them with additional important points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Textbooks**: Supplemented Marrow videos with standard Indian textbooks, not fancy authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. She used SRB for Surgery and Ramza snip for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Question Banks**: Did not solve question banks during her third and fourth years, focusing mainly on theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Post-Internship: Focused Practice

After her internship, which was heavy, Dr. Trupi started focusing on question-solving and Grand Tests (GTS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Weak Subject Strategy**: For weak subjects like Surgery, she focused on solving as many questions as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **GT Frequency**: Initially, she took GTS once a month, increasing to once every 15 days as her knowledge improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **GT Review**: To improve plateauing GT scores, she devised a "GT book" in the last 2-3 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
    *   The "GT book" was a small notebook containing mistakes from topics she had already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   She reviewed the entire GT on the same day, starting from her weakest subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Correct questions were quickly reviewed, while incorrect ones were read in detail and added to her notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Question Volume**: Initially solved 50 questions per day during her first revision, increasing to 100 questions daily later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Revision and Final Phase [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | Study and Revision Techniques]]

*   **Intermediate Phase (e.g., Nov INICET)**: During the period leading up to her 115 rank in November, she revised through notes and solved questions, including GTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Final Phase (Nov to May)**:
    *   Increased GT frequency from every 15 days to once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Maintained an average of 100 questions per day, sometimes more for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
    *   **Last 20 Days**: Revised all subjects once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
    *   **Last 5 Days**: Quickly reviewed highlighted points in her notes to remember facts closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This visual impression helped build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Hypothetical NEPG Strategy (20 days)**: If preparing for NEET PG with 20 days left, she would dedicate one day per subject to brush through notes and do previous year questions (PYQs), with the last five days for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Custom Modules and PYQs

Dr. Trupi regularly used custom modules as a key Marrow feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

*   **Initial Approach**: First completed all Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from the dedicated modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Tags Used**: After PYQs, she used tags such as "Neet," "AIIMS," "Clinical Questions," and "Image-based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Levels**: Chose "all difficulty levels" for custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Target Corrects**: Did not set a specific target for correct answers in custom modules, as new questions make it difficult and can lead to feeling bad if targets are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Bookmarking**: Bookmarked questions she got wrong but did not always find time to revisit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. In the last few days, she solely used the hashtag "KY cases" to solve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation

*   **Turning Point**: Her NEET PG rank of 19,000 did not deter her, as she had only covered 10-11 subjects and didn't expect a high rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The November INICET rank of 115 was a major confidence booster, indicating she could achieve a top rank if she covered all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Decision to Reattempt**: Despite a respectable rank of 115, she decided to give the exam one more shot because her parents supported her decision, and she had not "aimed for November" in terms of fatigue, feeling she still had gas left to push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Acceptance**: A crucial factor in improving was the ability to accept results and not blame external factors. She noted that "the faster we accept it, the better we can perform the next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Full-Time Study**: During her preparation period, she was solely focused on studying at home, not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## General Advice for Aspiring Medical Students

Dr. Trupi offered the following [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | effective study strategies]] for undergraduate students and those considering a drop year:

*   **Videos and Textbooks**: Watch all videos properly and supplement them by reading textbooks thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Avoid shortcuts as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Read consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   **Clinics**: Follow clinics, as it is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Internship Sincerity**: Work sincerely during internship, as it makes a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   **Start GTS Early**: Begin giving Grand Tests as early as possible once serious preparation starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Do not wait for the entire course to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Acceptance**: The faster one accepts their results (good or bad), the better they can perform in the next attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

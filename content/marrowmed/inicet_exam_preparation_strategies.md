Dr. NR, who secured Rank 1 in a recently conducted INICET exam, shared his [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation strategy]] and journey to success. His achievement is particularly notable because he primarily relied on standard textbooks [00:00:16].

## Journey to Rank One

Dr. NR previously secured Rank 205 in a May [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | INICET exam]] [00:01:16], which he felt was content given it was during his internship and he wasn't fully prepared with an [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | INICET oriented specific preparation]] [00:01:57]. He didn't solve many previous year questions (PYQs) for that attempt, relying on his baseline knowledge [00:02:08].

Following this, his NEET PG rank dropped to around 1000, which did not reflect his past scores or performance in Grand Tests (GTs) [00:03:00]. This prompted him to take a "final shot at Redemption" for the INICET exam [00:03:21]. For this attempt, he adopted a very specific [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | INICET oriented preparation strategy]], focusing on previous year topics and recurring areas [00:03:46]. He spent two months on this specific preparation, utilizing the time he gained due to delayed NEET PG counseling [00:03:38].

## Key [[ini_cet_exam_preparation_strategies | Preparation Strategies]]

Dr. NR's approach focused on a blend of theoretical understanding from textbooks and strategic practice using a question bank.

### Marrow QBank Utilization
He solved almost 700 modules from the Marrow QBank [00:04:36]. His strategy for approaching the QBank was to solve questions *after* reading a particular topic from his theory sources [00:04:48].

*   **Setting Targets**: He used to set daily targets for himself [00:05:02].
*   **Benchmarking**: He aimed for 70% to 80% correct answers in QBank modules. If he encountered very difficult questions, he would learn them at that moment and move on [00:06:30].
*   **Updates**: The QBank was helpful for keeping up with updates not found in textbooks, which are often reliant on newer editions [00:07:00]. The Marrow QBank provided pop-ups for revised answers or updates [00:07:48]. He also followed internet and Telegram channels for updates [00:08:06].

### Bookmark Management
Despite accumulating close to 5,000 bookmarks [00:08:47], Dr. NR employed a strategy to manage them for effective revision:

*   **Regular Review**: He used to revisit his bookmarks frequently, especially after hectic duties [00:09:00].
*   **Categorization**: He utilized Marrow's three categories of bookmarks to focus on key areas or recent updates [00:09:20].
*   **Magic Module**: He found the "Magic Module" feature useful, which allows revisiting wrong MCQs [00:09:56].
*   **Custom Modules & Tags**: He used custom modules to some extent [00:10:22]. For NEET, he focused on clinical questions using the `#clinical` tag [00:10:42]. For INICET, he primarily used the `#recentupdates` tag in his custom modules [00:11:35], as PYQs were covered through the standard question module [00:11:39].

### Reliance on Standard Textbooks
During his undergraduate years, Dr. NR primarily relied on standard textbooks [00:11:53]. He mentioned reading textbooks like Guyton and Robbins [00:12:37].

*   **Revision Method**: He mainly underlined important information in the textbooks themselves [00:13:13].
*   **Supplementary Notes**: He maintained a separate notebook for extra information gathered from libraries or the Marrow app [00:13:18].
*   **Conviction**: He maintained his focus on textbooks despite peers doing differently, believing his method was sound because college lectures were also based on these textbooks [00:15:00].

### Approach to Grand Tests (GTs)
Dr. NR was a "late starter" in giving GTs [00:16:21], beginning them around January during the final quarter of his internship [00:16:56]. His internship concluded in late March [00:17:06].

*   **Initial Frequency**: Initially, he gave GTs about once a month [00:18:08].
*   **Increased Frequency**: After his May INICET attempt, he started giving GTs very frequently, sometimes two to three per week, to compensate for a lack of exam practice [00:18:37].
*   **Target Score**: He didn't target a specific rank in GTs but aimed to get the bulk of the preparation done [00:17:48]. He usually scored above 170-175 correct answers, sometimes crossing 190 [00:19:13].
*   **Unique GT Strategy**: Due to time constraints, he did not solve GTs in one three-hour slot [00:19:40]. Instead, he broke them down into 40-45 minute slots, solving questions under exam conditions with a timer [00:19:53]. After each slot, he would review his answers, focusing on wrong questions or those providing new information, within 15-20 minutes [00:20:40]. This allowed him to manage his time and continue with his syllabus [00:21:17].
*   **GT Analysis**: He used the GT analysis feature to identify weak subjects or specific topics [00:22:07]. He would bookmark wrong questions or new information and revisit those areas [00:22:21].
*   **Confidence Booster**: Starting GTs, even later, provided a confidence boost when he saw positive results, reinforcing his place in the competition [00:29:06].

### Marrow Pearls Utilization
He used Marrow Pearls extensively for subjects like PSM (Community Medicine) [00:22:51] and some portions of Medicine, specifically GIT [00:22:57]. Pearls also appeared as explanations within the question bank, which he utilized [00:23:18].

### Personal Environment and Support
As a day scholar [00:23:30], Dr. NR highlighted the importance of a positive home environment. His father, a lawyer, provided inspiration by working alongside him [00:14:02]. His parents also supported his studies by minimizing disturbances like TV watching [00:30:06].

## Tips for Aspiring Students
Dr. NR offered five tips for students at different stages of their medical education:

1.  **Follow Standard Textbooks**: For first, second, or third-year students, it is crucial to follow standard textbooks [00:25:08].
2.  **Attend Clinical Postings Seriously**: There is valuable learning beyond textbooks, including re-emphasis on important points and exploration of extra areas [00:25:43].
3.  **Set Daily Targets**: For interns starting their [[journey_and_strategy_for_inicet_preparation | preparation]], set daily targets and strive to complete them [00:27:25].
4.  **Utilize QBank for Weaknesses**: Visit the QBank, identify areas of weakness, and revise them [00:27:39].
5.  **Don't Give Up**: Recognize that the journey is long with stumbles, but perseverance is key [00:27:50].

He recommended that students start appearing for Grand Tests earlier in their internship [00:28:17], acknowledging it was a "flaw on my part" not to do so [00:28:24]. Starting GTs early helps in identifying weaknesses and understanding one's standing in the race, providing positive reinforcement [00:28:49].

Dr. NR plans to pursue MD [[medicine_subject_focus_in_inicet_exams | Medicine]] [00:30:32].

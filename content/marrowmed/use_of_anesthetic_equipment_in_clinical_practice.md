This article summarizes key concepts and equipment in anesthesia, as discussed in a NEET PG 2024 recall session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Mechanical Ventilation and PEEP

A patient undergoing surgery in a prone position and maintained on PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) highlights the significance of PEEP in mechanical ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Definition**: PEEP stands for Positive End-Expiratory Pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: During expiration, alveoli naturally recoil and might collapse, especially in conditions like ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. PEEP applies a positive pressure at the end of exhalation to keep the alveoli open, thereby improving the patient's oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Clinical Application**: Prone position is commonly used in ARDS patients, including during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Effects**:
    *   PEEP does not decrease inspiratory pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   It decreases, rather than increases, venous return and cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   It does not primarily reduce carbon dioxide in the alveoli, as carbon dioxide has a high diffusion capacity and readily escapes when alveoli open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The main problem in ARDS is oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Chest Radiography and Pneumothorax

A patient with an acute exacerbation of COPD on mechanical ventilation, experiencing saturation drop and normal breath sounds on the left but a distinctive chest radiography finding, points to pneumothorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis Clues**:
    *   COPD patients on mechanical ventilation are prone to pneumothorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Consistent saturation drop despite ventilation is a significant clue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   Unilateral normal breath sounds (e.g., on the left) with absent breath sounds on the affected side (e.g., right) are characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, as seen in the classic chest X-ray showing pneumothorax on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Clinical Findings**:
    *   On the affected side, there is no air entry or decreased breath sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Reduced chest wall movement is also observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
    *   Percussion typically yields a hyperresonant note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Implication**: Positive pressure ventilation will worsen a pneumothorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Airway Management Instruments and Procedures

### Tracheal Deviation and Difficult Procedures

A radiograph showing tracheal deviation suggests difficulty in certain procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

*   **Procedure Difficulty**: Tracheal deviation makes [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tracheostomy]] difficult because it typically requires a midline incision to access the tracheal rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Unaffected Procedures**:
    *   Nasogastric tube insertion is not affected as it passes behind the trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
    *   LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway) insertion, a supraglottic airway, is not directly affected by tracheal deviation, but rather by inadequate mouth opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
    *   Indirect laryngoscopy, which visualizes vocal cords, is also generally unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Nasopharyngeal Airway

The instrument shown, designed to prevent tongue fall, is a nasopharyngeal airway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

*   **Identification**: It is distinct from an oropharyngeal airway (like a Guedel airway) or an uncuffed endotracheal tube due to its specific design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Prevents the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Local Anesthetics and Their Application

A patient given local anesthetic before IV cannulation, as depicted by a cream application, refers to EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

*   **Composition**: EMLA is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. A eutectic mixture has a lower melting point than its individual components, allowing for better absorption into the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Clinical Use**: It's often used in pediatric patients to numb the skin before IV cannulation, reducing pain and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. It's typically applied for 30-45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   **Side Effect**: Prilocaine, a component of EMLA, can cause [[understanding_of_anesthetic_drugs_and_complications | methemoglobinemia]], especially in neonates, if overdosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Concentration**: EMLA is commonly available as a 2.5% mixture (25 mg per 1g of cream) but 5% creams are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## Oxygen Delivery Devices

For an 80-year-old COVID patient with an oxygen saturation of 84% receiving oxygen at 4 L/min via nasal cannula, understanding oxygen delivery devices is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

*   **Classification**: Oxygen delivery devices are categorized into:
    *   **High-flow fixed performance**: Deliver a precise amount of oxygen (e.g., Venturi mask, often used in COPD patients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
    *   **Low-flow variable performance**: Deliver a variable FiO2 depending on patient's breathing pattern. Examples include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>:
        *   **Nasal cannula**: Flow rate of 1-6 L/min. Each liter increases FiO2 by approximately 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Total FiO2 from nasal cannula (including atmospheric 21%) can reach 44-45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. A patient receiving 4 L/min would receive roughly 37% FiO2 (4x4 + 21 = 37%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
        *   **Simple oxygen mask**: 6-10 L/min, 60-65% FiO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
        *   **Non-rebreathing mask (NRBM)**: 10-15 L/min, 80-85% FiO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

## Reversal Agents for Muscle Relaxants

For reversal of vecuronium when renal function is normal, specific agents are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

*   **Standard Reversal**: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants like vecuronium are traditionally reversed with [[Anesthesia recall for NEETPG 2024 | Neostigmine]], often combined with glycopyrrolate or atropine to counteract the muscarinic side effects (e.g., bradycardia) caused by increased acetylcholine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Newer Agent**: Sugammadex, introduced around 2017-2018, is a specific reversal agent for steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxants like rocuronium and vecuronium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism**: Sugammadex binds to the muscle relaxant molecule, forming a complex that is then excreted via the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Its effectiveness is dependent on normal renal function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
    *   **Advantages**: Provides rapid reversal, often described as "switch-like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Agents Not Preferred**: Physostigmine, pyrostigmine, and rasmin are not routinely used clinically for reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant, not a reversal agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

## Cardiac Rhythms and Defibrillation

A three-year-old child presenting as drowsy/stuporous with an ECG showing ventricular tachycardia (VT) requires immediate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

*   **Shockable Rhythms**: In ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support), shockable rhythms include Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (PVT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. The presented ECG is a classic example of VT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Non-Shockable Rhythms**: Asystole and PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) are non-shockable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Intervention**: For shockable rhythms like VT, the immediate next best step is defibrillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Following defibrillation, CPR should be continued for 2 minutes before rechecking the rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
*   **Synchronized Cardioversion**: This is generally performed for narrow QRS complexes and stable tachycardias, not pulseless VT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

## Patient Positioning for Airway Management

The image showing specific head and neck positioning for aligning axes is for airway management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

*   **Sniffing Position**: This position, also known as "sniffing of morning air," is the ideal position for intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. It involves flexion at the lower cervical spine and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: It aligns the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes, allowing for better visualization of the glottic opening during intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Differentiation**: It is distinct from the Rose position, where pillows are placed under the scapula blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

## Regional Anesthesia: Bier Block

The image showing a tourniquet inflated on the upper limb with an IV cannula in place illustrates a Bier block procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

*   **Other Name**: Also known as Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.
*   **Procedure**: A tourniquet is inflated to restrict blood flow, and a local anesthetic is injected intravenously into the limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. The hand becomes numb within a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Simple and effective, requiring only the ability to place an IV cannula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Approved Drugs**: Lidocaine 0.5% is the approved drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Prilocaine can also be considered but is less commonly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Contraindicated Drugs**: Bupivacaine is contraindicated due to its high cardiotoxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. Accidental systemic release can lead to difficult-to-treat cardiac arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Lidocaine-induced seizures, if accidental systemic release occurs, are generally manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

## Malignant Hyperthermia Triggers

A patient undergoing implant surgery under general anesthesia who develops tachycardia, sudden rise in body temperature, and muscle rigidity points to malignant hyperthermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

*   **Triggers**: The most likely drugs to cause malignant hyperthermia are all inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Halothane is an inhalational agent and a known trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. Nitrous oxide, etomidate (an intravenous anesthetic), and propofol (a safer option) do not trigger malignant hyperthermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation Cues**:
    *   Sudden tachycardia, hypertension, increased body temperature, and increased EtCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) are hallmark signs of malignant hyperthermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
    *   Other scenarios with similar initial symptoms include:
        *   **Bronchospasm**: Sudden tachycardia, hypertension, shark-fin pattern on EtCO2, and increased airway resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
        *   **Laryngospasm**: Sudden tachycardia, stridor, and rapid desaturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
        *   **Anaphylaxis**: Sudden tachycardia, hypotension, increased airway resistance, and airway/facial edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## [[Anesthesia breathing circuits | Anesthesia Breathing Circuits]]: Ambu Bag and Pop-Off Valve

The image of an Ambu bag (self-inflating manual resuscitator) with a marked structure refers to the pop-off valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

*   **Function**: The pop-off valve (or pressure relief valve) prevents barotrauma by releasing excessive pressure during manual ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Pressure**: In pediatric Ambu bags, this valve typically opens at 30-40 cm of water pressure to protect fragile lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. In adults, it might open up to 60 cm of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Normal positive pressure ventilation typically uses 10-20 cm of water pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.

## Capnography

A normal capnograph waveform, specifically segment C to D, provides information about exhaled carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: Capnography is the graphical representation of exhaled carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Phases of a Normal Capnograph**:
    *   **Phase 1 (A to B)**: Exhalation of dead space gas, which does not contain CO2, hence it's at baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (B to C)**: Expiratory upstroke, where mixed gases from both dead space and alveoli are exhaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (C to D)**: Alveolar plateau phase. This segment represents the exhalation of alveolar gas. It is a slight upward slope rather than a flat plateau due to uneven emptying of alveoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) is measured at point D, the peak of the plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Phase 0/4 (D to E)**: Inspiratory downstroke, where fresh gas is inhaled, and CO2 levels drop back to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Normal Shape**: A normal capnograph resembles a "top hat" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

## Post-Anesthesia Recovery Position

The recovery position, where the patient is kept in a left lateral position, is appropriate for specific patient conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.

*   **Appropriate Use**: This position is ideal for an unresponsive patient who still has a pulse and is breathing normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. This ensures airway patency and prevents aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
*   **Inappropriate Use**: If a patient is unresponsive with a pulse but not breathing (or gasping), rescue breaths should be administered (one breath every 6 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>. If the pulse is absent, CPR should be initiated immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. This question was previously asked in NEET PG 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

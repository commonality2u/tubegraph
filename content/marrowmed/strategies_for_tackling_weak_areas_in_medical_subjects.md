Dealing with weak subjects is a common challenge for students preparing for medical exams. Dr. Manoj Goa, a top scorer in the FMG exam, shared his strategies for approaching these areas, emphasizing a balanced and realistic approach.

## Identifying and Strengthening Weak Areas

Dr. Manoj highlighted the importance of proactively addressing weak subjects before the exam. He advises students to identify their weaker areas and make a conscious effort to strengthen them [00:21:20]. This contrasts with the tendency to focus only on strong subjects, where one might feel confident but neglect areas of true weakness [00:21:27].

> "There will be some weaker weaker areas for all the students just make sure that you stand them before the exam... so make sure you read those ween areas and strengthen yourself before you go enter the exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>

## Targeted Approach for Specific Weak Subjects

For subjects where he felt particularly weak, Dr. Manoj adopted a pragmatic strategy:

### Biochemistry Example
Dr. Manoj identified Biochemistry as his "weakest area" [00:11:04]. Rather than trying to master it completely, which he felt would be futile ("even if I read I'll forget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>), his [[approach_to_revising_weak_subjects_in_medical_studies | approach to revising weak subjects]] was to:
*   **Limit focus**: He did not spend excessive time on the subject [00:11:04].
*   **Prioritize other subjects**: He was prepared to "give up on 10 marks with biochemistry" to focus on areas where he could score better [00:11:08].
*   **Focus on Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: For Biochemistry, his primary method of [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study technique]] was to go through PYQs [00:11:15]. This allowed him to gain some exposure without deep dives into complex concepts.

## General Principles for Tackling Weaknesses

Beyond specific subjects, Dr. Manoj's overall [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | effective study strategies]] and [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | exam strategy and mindset]] suggest:

*   **Don't chase information**: He advises sticking to one source and not constantly switching platforms or materials, even for weak areas [00:21:40]. His success came from relying solely on Marrow's materials [00:22:06].
*   **Consistency**: While not explicitly stated for weak areas alone, his overall [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | study and revision techniques]] show consistency in reviewing and taking Grand Tests (GTs), which would naturally expose and help address weak points over time [00:14:47].
*   **Reviewing GTs thoroughly**: He reviewed every question in his GTs, even those he answered correctly, to understand explanations or simpler solutions, which could help reinforce understanding in any subject, including weak ones [00:14:31].

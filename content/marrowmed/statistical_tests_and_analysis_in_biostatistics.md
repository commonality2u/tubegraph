The INI CET May 2025 exam included a "decently easy" level of community medicine questions, with approximately four easy multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from [[Biostatistics and Epidemiology Concepts | biostats]] [[00:00:23]], [[00:00:39]]. The intention of discussing these questions is to understand the patterns of MCQs being followed in such exams [[00:00:17]].

## Key Statistical Parameters

Understanding various statistical parameters and what phenomena they represent is crucial [[00:03:22]].

*   **Mean and Median**: These are measures of central tendency, indicating the "center point" of a dataset [[00:05:22]], [[00:05:32]]. They do not measure dispersion [[00:05:25]].
*   **Standard Error**: This parameter is used to measure variability or dispersion within data, showing how much values vary from the mean [[00:04:50]], [[00:05:06]].
*   **Correlation Coefficient**: This tells you about the relationship between variables, indicating positive, negative, or no correlation [[00:03:38]], [[00:04:40]].
*   **Moments**: These are used to measure the skewness of a distribution, describing its shape [[00:03:42]], [[00:04:25]]. The "peakness" of a distribution is referred to as kurtosis [[00:04:09]].

## Measures of Position (Tiles)

"Tiles" refer to dividing data into distinct parts [[00:06:07]], [[00:06:58]]. This system helps in understanding the location of a specific data point within the entire dataset [[00:08:11]], [[00:08:52]].

*   **Intercepts vs. Parts**: If you make two "cuts" (intercepts) in a data series, it divides the data into three parts [[00:06:33]], [[00:06:41]].
*   **Types of Tiles**:
    *   **Quartiles**: Result from three intercepts, dividing data into four parts [[00:07:17]], [[00:07:26]].
    *   **Deciles**: Result from nine intercepts, dividing data into ten parts [[00:07:29]], [[00:07:31]], [[00:07:58]].
    *   **Quintiles (Pentiles)**: Result from four intercepts, dividing data into five parts [[00:07:40]], [[00:07:44]], [[00:07:46]].
    *   **Centiles (Percentiles)**: Result from 99 cuts, dividing data into 100 tiles/parts [[00:07:58]], [[00:08:03]], [[00:08:39]].

## Statistical Significance Tests

Tests of significance are chosen based on the number of groups being studied and the type of data collected [[00:10:19]], [[00:10:29]].

*   **Parametric Tests**: Used for quantitative data or normally distributed data [[00:10:09]], [[00:10:12]].
    *   **Paired t-test**: Applied for a single group where measurements are taken before and after an intervention (e.g., weight before and after counseling for 100 patients with diabetes) [[00:09:41]], [[00:10:34]], [[00:11:44]], [[00:11:59]]. This is appropriate for quantitative and normally distributed data like body weight [[00:11:53]], [[00:11:57]].
    *   **Unpaired t-test (Independent Sample t-test)**: Used for two independent groups [[00:10:38]], [[00:12:16]].
    *   **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used when comparing three or more groups [[00:10:45]].
*   **Non-Parametric Tests**: Used for qualitative data or non-normally distributed data (data with skewness) [[00:09:57]], [[00:10:05]].
    *   **Mac Nemmer test**: Used for a single group with qualitative data [[00:10:50]].
    *   **Chi-square test**: Used for two groups with qualitative data [[00:10:55]], [[00:12:10]].
    *   **Kruskal-Wallis test**: Generally used for three or more groups with qualitative data [[00:11:04]].
    *   **Wilcoxon rank test**: Can also be used for ordinal data with three or more groups [[00:11:13]].

## Sampling Methods

Sampling involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population for a study [[00:12:53]].

*   **Stratified Random Sampling**: This method involves dividing the total population into different "strata" (subgroups) based on a third variable (e.g., low, medium, or high disease burden regions) and then selecting individuals randomly from each stratum [[00:13:38]], [[00:13:57]], [[00:14:03]].
*   **Systematic Sampling**: Involves selecting every nth person (e.g., every 10th person) from a list [[00:13:05]], [[00:13:15]].
*   **Convenience Sampling**: A non-probability sampling method where samples are selected based on convenience [[00:14:09]].
*   **Simple Random Sampling**: Based on methods like lottery or random numbers [[00:14:17]].

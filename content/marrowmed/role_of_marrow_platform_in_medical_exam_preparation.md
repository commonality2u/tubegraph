Dr. Manoj Goa, who achieved an "unbelievable" score of 256 in the January 12th FMG exam, attributed his success significantly to the [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. His systematic and consistent [[role_of_marrow_in_exam_preparation | utilization of Marrow]] materials from his undergraduate years proved pivotal.

## Initial Engagement with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]]

Dr. Manoj subscribed to [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] in his third year of MBBS, influenced by his sister who advised him not to waste time as he had in his NEET preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. He conducted extensive research, watching 30-40 YouTube videos and choosing [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] based on numerous positive reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He purchased a two-year subscription (Plan C) and obtained the printed notes of [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] Edition 6.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. He later extended his subscription for NEET PG preparation, indicating his satisfaction with the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## [[Role of Marrow in exam preparation | Preparation Strategy]] and [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow's]] Contribution

Dr. Manoj successfully balanced his college curriculum with his [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] studies, adopting a focused approach:
*   **Third Year:** He concentrated on completing third-year subjects (ENT, Ophthalmology, Community Medicine) comprehensively using [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow videos]], Q-bank, and previous year's questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. He watched every video, including MCQ discussions, and solved all associated Q-banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. He focused on strengthening these core subjects, completing ENT in one month and spending a significant portion of his time on Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   **Final Year:** He completed final year subjects such as Ob-Gyn, Medicine, Surgery, and Pediatrics using [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. He watched nearly all the main Medicine videos (220 out of 240), except for Endocrinology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **First and Second Year Subjects:** These were tackled in the six months leading up to the exam, taking about two and a half months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. He chose to focus on PYQs for biochemistry, as it was his weakest area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Simultaneous Study:** Dr. Manoj watched videos, simultaneously read printed notes, and then practiced MCQs for the same topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Question Banks:** He completed 650 modules of [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams | Marrow's Q-bank]] in his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, primarily using the NEET PG Q-bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects:** For subjects like Skin, Anesthesia, Radiology, and Psychiatry, he relied on [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow's]] revision notes (Edition 6.5) after returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. He found that thoroughly reading every word in the revision notes was sufficient to answer 70-80% of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

## Revisions and Grand Tests (GTs)

*   **Revisions:** Dr. Manoj completed three full readings/revisions before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. For Surgery, Ob-Gyn, and Community Medicine, he used his main notes, annotating them with new points into his revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. For other subjects, he relied solely on the revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs):** He started giving GTs from August 1st, after beginning his preparation in mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
    *   His first GT score was 231, which significantly boosted his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.
    *   Initially, he planned to give one GT per month, then every two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. After scoring well (230+), he focused more on completing the syllabus and strengthening weaker areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Reviewing GTs:** His strategy was to review *every single question*, regardless of whether he got it right or wrong, for the first 6-7 GTs. He believed in understanding the explanations, even for correct answers, to find easier solution methods or additional information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. He would review 30-40 questions per day, rather than all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
    *   He also participated in [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow's]] National Mock Test, scoring 259 with a rank of 11/56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
    *   Dr. Manoj affirmed that [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] GTs are a true reflection of the actual exam, with similar questions that build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## Impact on Confidence and Success

Dr. Manoj's consistent [[use of Marrow for medical studies | use of Marrow]] from his third year provided him with a strong foundation and immense confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. He felt so confident that he believed he would pass even if he didn't study further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. He praised several [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] faculties, including Manisha Ma'am for ENT, Dr. Sakshi Roa Hans, Rakesh Sir, and Mukesh Sir, for making complex subjects understandable and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspirants

Dr. Manoj strongly advised sticking to one primary source like [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] and believing in it, rather than chasing information from multiple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.

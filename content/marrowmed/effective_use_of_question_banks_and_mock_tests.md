Dr. Manoj Goa, who scored 256 in the January 12th FMG exam, attributes part of his success to a consistent and strategic approach to using study materials, including [[Using question banks and practice modules | question banks]] and [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | mock tests]] (Grand Tests or GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His methodology emphasizes integrating these practice tools with foundational learning from the beginning of his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Integrated Approach to Study
Dr. Goa started his preparation in his third year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. His strategy involved:
*   **Completing Subjects Thoroughly**: He focused on finishing each subject completely, including all videos, [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question banks]], and previous year's questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Simultaneous Learning and Practice**: While watching videos, he simultaneously read printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Once a video or topic was complete, he immediately did the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Type of Question Bank**: Throughout his MBBS, he primarily solved the NEET PG [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | Q bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Extensive Module Practice**: By the time he completed his third and fourth-year subjects, he had already solved approximately 650 modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He also consistently gave subject-wise tests during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## [[Role of grand tests and question banks in exam preparation | Grand Tests]] (GTs) Strategy
Dr. Goa emphasized the critical role of [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] in his preparation, stating that they were very similar to the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

### When to Start
*   Dr. Goa began his GTs early in his dedicated six-month preparation period, giving his first GT on August 1st, after starting preparation in mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   He scored 231 on his first GT, even though he had only finished Microbiology and Pharmacology at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Frequency
*   Initially, he planned to give one GT per month until his first reading was complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   After the first few GTs (four or five), he adjusted his strategy to focus more on completing the syllabus, as he was already scoring well (230+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. His overall goal was consistent GTs to uplift marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Reviewing GTs
*   **Thorough Review**: He reviewed each and every question, regardless of whether he got it right with confidence, with doubt, or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Learning from Explanations**: He reviewed correct answers too, because sometimes explanations offered a simpler way to solve a question or provided additional understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Spaced Review**: He did not review all questions on the same day. Instead, he reviewed 30-40 questions per day, which would take about 10 days to complete a 300-question GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### GTs as Exam Reflection
*   Dr. Goa felt that the [[effective_utilization_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | GTs]] were a true reflection of the actual paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   During the actual exam, he felt as if he was still giving the Marrow GTs because the questions were very similar, and he recognized many questions from his previous GT attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This similarity helped him conquer weaker areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   His score in the national mock test was 259, with a rank of 11, which was very close to his final FMG score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Students
*   **Focus on Concepts**: The FMG exam is "ever evolving," and questions are becoming more conceptual, making rote learning or relying on one-liners insufficient to clear the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Concepts are built by reading study material from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Passing Marks**: Students should first aim to secure the passing marks (150) to be in the "green zone" before chasing higher scores like 230-250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Getting a question wrong in practice is acceptable as the basic requirement is to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Weak Areas**: Students should identify and strengthen their weaker areas before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Stick to One Source**: Dr. Goa highly recommends sticking to a single, trusted source of information and believing in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. He did not watch any external YouTube videos, MCQ discussion videos, or picture-based discussions, relying solely on Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Determination**: His success is also attributed to his determination and consistency from the very beginning of his undergraduate studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

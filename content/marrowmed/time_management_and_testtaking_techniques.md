Success in challenging medical entrance exams like NEET PG requires a strategic approach to [[time_management_and_scheduling_study_sessions | time management]] and honed [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | test-taking techniques]]. Vaibhav, the NEET PG 2024 rank holder, shares his insights on how to maintain consistency, optimize study methods, and manage exam pressure.

## Cultivating Consistency and Balance

Vaibhav's overarching motto during his preparation was "just keep going and just take it one day at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He emphasized the importance of maintaining balance, recognizing that not every day will feel the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> "Keep the balance... because every day is not the same. Some there will be some days when you are feeling very much positive and you may give more number of hours, but it is those days when you are not feeling that much great even if you put little bit of effort, solve a little bit of a few questions or even give a mini test that day, that makes up your day and you would not regret wasting that day." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

This approach ensures continuous progress, even with small, consistent efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Strategic Study Approach

Vaibhav's study strategy involved a structured approach to learning:
1.  **Video Lectures**: Start by watching video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
2.  **Textbook Review**: Consult standard textbooks and related texts for deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
3.  **Question Bank Practice**: Solve questions from question banks to reinforce concepts and facts learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Note-Making for [[efficient_study_habits_and_notetaking | Efficient Study Habits and Notetaking]]

Vaibhav employed a mixed approach for note-making, adapting to the time available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:
*   **Handwritten Notes**: For subjects like pharmacology, pathology, surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology, he made his own handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Printed Notes**: For other subjects, he utilized printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Selective Information**: He was very selective in adding information from question banks to his notes, only including highly conceptual or catchy facts he hadn't encountered before to avoid making them bulky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The goal of notes is conciseness for quick revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Mastering Test-Taking Techniques

Vaibhav highlighted the critical role of tests in his preparation. He enjoyed taking grand tests, viewing them as a favorite learning tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Grand Tests: Frequency and Environment
*   **Early Start**: He began taking grand tests at the beginning of his final year and continued regularly through his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Increasing Frequency**: Initially, he took tests every 15-20 days, then every 10 days, increasing to every 5-7 days in the last 3-4 months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Simulating Exam Conditions**: He often took grand tests in his college library's computer zone with friends, simulating the real examination environment. This helped him learn to avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Practicing in such conditions helps in handling exam stress and technical issues during tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Time Management During Exams
For the NEET PG exam, which featured five sets of 40 questions with 42 minutes per set, [[time_management_skills_during_exams | time management skills during exams]] and speed were crucial from the very first minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **One Question at a Time**: He tackled the pattern by focusing on one question at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Rule Out Options**: He dedicated time to each question, methodically ruling out incorrect options to arrive at the best possible answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Review Strategy**: He aimed to complete the first pass through questions in 32-35 minutes, using the remaining time to review skipped or marked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Skipping Tough Questions**: In both mock and real exams, he skipped tough or unknown questions on the first pass, returning to them later if new insights or options ruling became possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This allowed him to first secure marks from questions he was comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Utilizing Custom Modules and Revision Videos
*   **Custom Modules**: During internship duties or free periods, he used custom modules for quick mini-tests, solving and reviewing them on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos/Notes**: For major and third-year subjects, he used revision video notes, especially towards the end of preparation, as they offered crisp and precise information, saving time compared to watching full videos again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

## Mindset for Success

Vaibhav's advice to juniors emphasizes a healthy mindset:
*   **Don't Over-Attach Emotionally**: He advises against becoming too emotionally attached to the exam, viewing it as a transit phase rather than a life-or-death situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. While putting in one's best effort is essential, emotional detachment helps in managing potential setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Start Early and Be Consistent**: Starting preparation early is key, allowing sufficient time to cover all subjects, question banks, and mock exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Consistency, even with small efforts like solving a single MCQ, cumulatively adds to knowledge and preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Enjoy the Process**: It's vital to enjoy the "art of solving questions" and make it a friend rather than fearing tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. The more questions one faces, the more the fear diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Vaibhav's journey underscores that success stems from a blend of early preparation, consistent effort, strategic test practice, and a resilient mindset.

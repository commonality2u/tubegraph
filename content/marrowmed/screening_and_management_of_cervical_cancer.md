Cervical cancer screening guidelines are crucial, particularly in low-resource settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

## Screening Guidelines in Low Resource Settings (WHO Protocol)

In low-resource settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol for cervical cancer screening is followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Age to Start Screening**: 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   **Age to Complete Screening**: 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>

### WHO Screening Approaches

There are two main approaches advocated by the WHO:

#### 1. See and Treat Approach
*   This approach involves performing [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA testing and Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   If either the [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] test or VIA is positive, the patient is treated immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.

#### 2. Test and Treat Approach
*   First, an [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA test is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   This is followed by VIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   If both tests are positive, management proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

### Follow-up after Testing (WHO)

*   If [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA is negative:
    *   In the general population, repeat testing after 5 to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.
    *   In HIV-positive patients, repeat testing after 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.
*   If [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA is positive and VIA is negative:
    *   Repeat [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] testing after 1 to 2 years to check for persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.
*   If VIA is negative:
    *   Repeat testing after 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

## ACOG Screening Protocols

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines differ from WHO:
*   **Age to Start Screening**: 21 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
*   **Method**: Pap smear, repeated every 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.
*   From 30 years onward, a **CO-test** ([[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA testing plus Pap smear) should be done every 5 years until 65 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.
*   If previous 10 years showed normal Pap tests, screening can be continued until 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

## WHO Goals for 2030 (90-70-90)

The WHO has set ambitious goals for cervical cancer elimination by 2030, known as the 90-70-90 targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>:
*   **90%**: 90% of females should be vaccinated for [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
    *   The ideal age for [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] vaccination is 11 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **70%**: 70% of reproductive-age females should be screened for cancer of the cervix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.
    *   WHO recommends screening females between 30 to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **90%**: 90% of females should be treated for cervical cancer if any abnormality arises from screening tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Pap Smear vs. HPV/VIA in Low Resource Settings

Pap smear without a biopsy is not sufficient for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. In low-resource settings, waiting for Pap smear results, then conducting a biopsy, and then treating based on the biopsy report is often not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. This is why investigations that lead to immediate treatment if positive, such as [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] DNA testing and VIA, are preferred in these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]] is a sexually transmitted disease that can be present in young females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>, but it is the persistence of [[hpv_strains_and_cervical_cancer_pathogenesis | HPV]], not just its presence, that can lead to dysplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

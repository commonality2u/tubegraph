Dr. Phillip achieved an impressive Rank 6 in the INI CET May 2025 exam, demonstrating a remarkable journey of dedication and strategic preparation. This success followed a previous Rank 173 in the May 2024 INI CET, after which he made the bold decision to leave his first-year PG in AIIMS Delhi to re-prepare for the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Dr. Phillip's Unique Journey and Mindset

Dr. Phillip's decision to leave a PG seat showcased significant self-belief and a commitment to his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. He started his focused preparation relatively late, only from January for the May exam, after leaving his PG course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He approached this period with the mindset that there was "no other option" but to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Focused Preparation with Question Bank (QBank)

Given the limited timeframe of five months, Dr. Phillip primarily relied on the question bank for his [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
He found the QBank to be sufficient when time is short because it provides explanations for every question, allowing for a faster revision process compared to main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He solved approximately 700 to 720 question bank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Bookmarking and Custom Modules

Dr. Phillip initially completed the question bank modules subject-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He consistently bookmarked questions he found difficult, those he perceived as important for the exam, or factual questions that many would be able to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Initial Bookmarks**: Around 3,000 questions after the first revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Reduced Bookmarks**: This was significantly reduced to about 500-600 questions after subsequent reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

He used custom modules to compile important questions for subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### [[effective_revision_tactics_for_medical_exams | Effective Revision Tactics]]

Dr. Phillip completed about 500 QBank modules in the first two to two and a half months (January to mid-March) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. From March onwards, his main [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | strategy]] shifted to reviewing questions he had done incorrectly and utilizing custom modules of mixed questions across all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This approach allowed him to revise all subjects concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

For concepts that were unclear, especially in first-year subjects like Anatomy and Biochemistry where he lacked confidence, he resorted to the main videos for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Review Process

He started giving Grand Tests after completing six to eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

*   **Initial Performance**: Scores were around 130-135, with ranks ranging from 8,000 to 9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Final Performance**: His last GT saw 170 questions correct and a rank of 17, which boosted his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

GT frequency:
*   Initially: Once every 10-12 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Later: Once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

He consistently reviewed his GTs either on the same day or the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. His review pattern prioritized:
1.  Questions skipped (no idea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
2.  Questions done wrongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  Questions answered by eliminating options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
He did not have time to review questions he was very sure about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Utilizing Marrow Features

Two specific features of Marrow were particularly helpful:
*   **Delta MCQ discussion videos**: Found these excellent, especially how they explained why certain options were incorrect and addressed frequently mistaken topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Magic Modules**: Helped compile questions that were answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Confidence

While initially confident, Dr. Phillip experienced anxiety and panic as the exam neared, questioning his decision to leave his PG seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## [[advice_for_specific_medical_subjects_and_exams | General Advice for Students]]

Dr. Phillip offered several key [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | tips]] to aspirants:

*   **[[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | Start Early]]**: For those in earlier years of medical school, it's a good time to begin preparation by reading standard textbooks to build a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiple Paths to Success**: Recognize that there are numerous ways to achieve a good rank, not just through main or revision videos. Trust your chosen [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | preparation method]], especially if reviewing GTs indicates you are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Avoid being swayed by others' methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Monitor Progress**: Regularly checking progress through GT graphs and analytics is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While scores might drop, they will rise again if the preparation is correct. GTs are vital for assessing the effectiveness of one's [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Address Weak Subjects**: Utilize GT analytics to identify the bottom five subjects and prioritize their thorough revision before the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

As the [[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | NEET PG exam]] and INI-CET exam approach, with approximately 80 days remaining, it's crucial to adopt a focused and effective [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This period should primarily focus on revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas

### Exam Dates & Approach
*   **INI-CET** is scheduled for May 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **NEET PG** is scheduled for June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Don't rely on postponements**: Plan your [[strategies_for_neetpg_2025_preparation | preparation]] according to these official dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Prioritize INI-CET**: Aim to complete one full revision before the INI-CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   A good performance in INI-CET can boost confidence for NEET PG or potentially negate the need to appear for it, avoiding the "two sessions" chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   If INI-CET doesn't go as planned, you'll still have a month for targeted revision before NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Subject Focus**:
    *   **INI-CET**: Focus more on first and second-year subjects, as they are often the determining factor for rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   **NEET PG**: After INI-CET, shift focus to clinical subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Address Weak Areas**: Now is the time to tackle weak subjects, whether they are pre/para-clinical or clinical, rather than postponing them until the end when anxiety is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Time Distribution: Notes vs. MCQs
*   **MCQs are paramount**: In the last 80 days, MCQs are the mainstay of your [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Daily MCQ target**: Aim to solve at least 100 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This requires approximately 3.5 to 4 hours, including reviewing explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Broad time split**: A general guideline is 60/40 or 50/50 split between notes revision and MCQ practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This can vary based on individual progress; if you have pending subjects, allocate more time to notes, but still do MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Maintain MCQ flow**: Continue practicing MCQs daily to maintain your exam-taking skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Effective Use of Resources

### Revision Videos
*   **Stick to your primary notes**: If you are comfortable with your main video notes, continue using them for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Don't switch to revision notes due to FOMO, as new notes take longer to assimilate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **When to use revision videos**:
    *   If you've used revision videos for certain short subjects and are comfortable with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   If you have missed subjects or have difficulty finishing regular videos, revision videos are a good option to cover focused content in less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   For short subjects: Directly jump to revision videos and supplement with MCQ videos and QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   For major subjects (e.g., Surgery, Medicine, Obs/Gynae) with 80 days left: Stick to revision videos, supplement with QBank and MCQ discussion videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### MCQ Discussion Videos
*   **Interactive learning**: These videos allow you to attempt questions interactively and then listen to explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: They cover frequently asked and recently tested topics, helping students identify areas where they make mistakes despite having learned the concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
*   **Usage strategy**:
    *   **For those relying on revision videos**: Definitely use them to learn how to apply theory to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
    *   **For those who watched regular videos/did QBank**: Use them as subject-wise tests curated by faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   **Skip known explanations**: If you get a question correct and understand the logic, skip the explanation and move to the next question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
    *   **Review incorrect/guessed answers**: Listen to explanations for questions you got wrong or guessed correctly, especially those where your logic was unsound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **GT Discussion Questions**: The last MCQ discussion video for each subject includes questions from GTs that a majority of students got wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. These are often complex reasoning questions, and reviewing them helps improve scores and overcome fear of GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: MCQ discussion videos include previous year questions and topics, rephrased and redesigned to cover all relevant areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

### QBank
*   **Crucial for practice**: Essential to supplement revision, especially for areas you are weak in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **PYQs**: Do PYQs from the QBank, as they are verbatim questions asked in previous exams, building confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   **Target 3-5 years of PYQs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.
*   **Rank expectations**: Relying *only* on revision videos and PYQs (done multiple times) might lead to a rank of 5,000-10,000+. To achieve a rank below 5,000, you need to do extra MCQs from the QBank and revise their explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   **Start immediately**: The best time to start giving GTs was "yesterday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs help develop exam skills and simulate the actual test environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. They reveal where your theoretical knowledge falters in a question-answering format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Once a week, or a maximum of twice a week/twice in 10 days, depending on your [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation]] stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Daily GTs are not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Overcome GT fear**: Giving GTs early and regularly helps overcome the phobia of low scores and potential demotivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Reviewing a GT effectively (2-3 hours)**:
    1.  **Correct & Known**: Questions you got correct and understand why – skip reviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
    2.  **Unknown/Factual**:
        *   If it's a factual question not asked previously, with a very low correct percentage – read once and ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
        *   If it's a factual question that most students got right but you got wrong – bookmark it and add to notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
    3.  **Conceptual/Guessed Correctly**: Read the explanation, bookmark, or add to notes for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
    4.  **Conceptual/Thought you knew but got wrong**: Pause, revise, and read these explanations thoroughly. These are the key to improving your GT score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   **Attempt aggressively**: In GTs, attempt as many questions as possible without worrying too much about negative marks or the score. The goal is to learn how to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Fine-tune strategy**: Use GTs as a mock test to experiment with different strategies (e.g., aggressive vs. conservative attempting) to find what works best for you on exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Utilize GT analysis**: The analysis provided by Marrow shows which subjects are pulling your score down. Address these weak subjects through revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.

### Custom Modules
*   **New Feature**: Custom Modules can now simulate the exam pattern with 40-question blocks and 42 minutes for each block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   **Tags to use**:
    *   **Must-do**: Recent NEET, clinical questions, conceptual questions, recent updates, image-based questions, investigation of choice, drug of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
    *   **Optional (if time permits)**: Factual, number-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Tailor to weaknesses**: Create custom modules for subjects or specific topics you are weak in (e.g., cancer staging). Focus on questions you've bookmarked or gotten wrong, especially those frequently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

### Pearls
*   **Quick revision tool**: Useful for all students, whether for quick revision of important topics or to supplement extra knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Fragmented information**: Pearls contain facts and information (e.g., eponymous terms, drug/investigation of choice) that are often forgotten or confused between subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

## Addressing Specific Scenarios

### Students with Pending Subjects
*   **Short Subjects**: Prioritize revision videos, followed by MCQ videos and QBank for short subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Revision videos for short subjects are almost as comprehensive as regular videos in terms of content, though with less depth of explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Major Subjects (e.g., Surgery, Medicine)**: If major subjects are pending, use revision videos. Supplement them with the QBank and MCQ discussion videos to target 75-80% correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### Working Professionals / Students with Family Obligations
*   **Time constraints**: Stick to revision videos, previous year questions from QBank, and MCQ discussion videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Dive deeper into the QBank if more time permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritize revision**: It's better to revise fewer concepts multiple times to cement them, rather than doing many things once and failing to retain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

### Students Starting Preparation Now
*   **Aggressive approach**: Focus on revision videos, QBank, and MCQ discussion videos. Give your best, knowing that many have cracked exams with concentrated effort in the last few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

### GT Score Not Improving
*   **Revision of weak subjects**: Analyze your GT performance to identify subjects causing low scores and prioritize their revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   **Incorrect answering strategy**: Use the GT discussion videos (the last MCQ discussion video for each subject) to understand faculty reasoning and refine your approach to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.
*   **Refine GT strategy**: Experiment with how many questions to attempt and leave, using the guess tracker to refine your guessing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Balance knowledge acquisition and maintenance**: Improve GT score by both maintaining knowledge of what you've read (through constant revision) and adding new information from areas you haven't covered, especially previously tested topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

## Mental and Practical Tips

### Consistency and Discipline
*   **Daily effort**: Consistency is key in the last 80 days. Focus on daily preparation and revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
*   **"Do things when you don't feel like doing it"**: True consistency involves pushing through when tired, unmotivated, or facing external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Improve daily**: Focus on improving slightly each day compared to the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.

### Overcoming Procrastination
*   **Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused blocks (e.g., 30-45 minutes) without distractions, followed by short breaks (5-10 minutes). This makes the commitment less daunting than planning for 8-10 hour sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.
*   **During breaks**: Get up, move, hydrate, breathe fresh air. Avoid infinite scrolling on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

### Managing Fatigue and Mental Health
*   **Prioritize sleep**: Get adequate sleep and maintain a fixed sleep schedule to combat mental and physical fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Healthy habits**: Eat healthy, stay well-hydrated, and consider a multivitamin (D3, B12 are often low) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   **Breaks & social support**: Your mind needs breaks. Incorporate short breaks during study sessions, and occasionally take time out with friends and family to reset and recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Positive environment**: Surround yourself with positive people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### Managing FOMO and Comparisons
*   **Realistic expectations**: Be clear about your personal goals for the exam. Don't compare your [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation strategy]] with others, as their goals and circumstances may be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
*   **Tailored plan**: Create a personalized [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | plan]] for the next 80 days and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.
*   **Avoid new sources**: Do not fall into the trap of exploring new short courses or materials available in the market. Stick to one trusted source and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

### When to Stop Adding Information to Notes
*   **Last 45 days**: Avoid adding any new information to notes unless it's a previously asked question you're consistently getting wrong and learning for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on mastering tested topics**: Ensure you thoroughly know topics tested in the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

### "20th Notebook" Alternative
*   **Dynamic revision**: Instead of a static 20th notebook (which takes time to create), make personal WhatsApp or Telegram groups for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
*   **Screenshots & images**: Take screenshots of challenging concepts, difficult stagings, or images (e.g., instruments) and put them in the relevant subject group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Regular review & deletion**: Review these groups frequently (e.g., before a GT) and delete information once you are thorough with it. This creates a filtered, dynamic list of your personal weak points for last-minute revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

In summary, the next 80 days demand consistency, smart revision, and effective utilization of available resources to maximize your chances of success in the [[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | NEET PG exam]] and INI-CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

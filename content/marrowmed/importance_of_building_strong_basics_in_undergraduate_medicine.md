Building a strong foundation in the initial years of medical education is crucial for success in professional exams and future medical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Dr. Tejas Dhage, who achieved an All India Rank 8 in the INICET November 2024 exam, emphasizes the significance of this early preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Starting Early and Using Standard Textbooks

Dr. Dhage began his [[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | PG preparation journey]] from his first year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He consistently studied from [[importance_of_standard_textbooks_in_medical_studies | standard textbooks]] during his first and second years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This approach laid a solid basic foundation for his undergraduate studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Impact on Later Years

A strong grasp of first and second-year subjects is vital because a majority of third and fourth-year subjects are also covered within this foundational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. According to Dr. Dhage, if these early subjects are well-covered, there's no need for significant extra effort later on for related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

He noted that his [[importance_of_a_strong_foundation_in_anatomy_physiology_and_biochemistry | basic knowledge]] from the initial years was so strong that he didn't need to watch entire video lectures for those subjects in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He only reviewed specific topics he was unsure about or frequently got wrong in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, showcasing the benefits of [[effective_study_strategies_for_firstyear_MBBS_students | effective study strategies]] from the start.

Ultimately, having a solid basic knowledge is paramount before delving into more advanced topics or video assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

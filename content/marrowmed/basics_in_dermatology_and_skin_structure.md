## Embryological Origin of Skin Layers

The various layers of the skin originate from different embryonic germ layers:
*   The epidermis is derived from the ectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   The hypodermis and dermis are derived from the mesoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Initially, it was incorrectly stated that the hypodermis and dermis are derived from the endoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The dermis of the face and frontal scalp are derived from the neural crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Dermis elsewhere in the body is derived from the mesoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Epidermal Layers

Within the epidermis, specific layers have distinct characteristics:
*   The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   It is not considered a cellular layer because it does not contain living, metabolically active cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   The outermost cellular layer of the epidermis is the stratum granulosum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Skin Regeneration

The epidermis possesses regenerative capabilities:
*   The epidermis regenerates from deeper cells, including those found in hair follicles and sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## [[stem_cells_in_dermatology|Stem Cells in Dermatology]]

[[stem_cells_in_dermatology|Stem cells]] are crucial for skin health and regeneration:
*   They are capable of self-renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   They can differentiate into specific cell types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Locations of [[stem_cells_in_dermatology|Stem Cells]]
Three important locations for [[stem_cells_in_dermatology|stem cells]] in the skin are:
1.  **Interfollicular epidermis**: Specifically found in the stratum basale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
2.  **Base of the sebaceous gland** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Bulge of the hair follicle**: This area represents the attachment of the arrector pili muscle to the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Functions of [[stem_cells_in_dermatology|Stem Cells]]
The three important functions of [[stem_cells_in_dermatology|stem cells]] include:
1.  Maintaining skin homeostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
2.  Responsible for the regeneration of skin appendages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
3.  Facilitating self-repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, which ties into their capacity for self-renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

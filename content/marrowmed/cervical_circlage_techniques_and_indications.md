[[Cervical Insufficiency and Incompetence | Cervical insufficiency]], also known as cervical incompetence, refers to the spontaneous dilation of the cervix, specifically the internal os, which can lead to second-trimester abortions [00:00:10]. Patients typically present with a history of painless, recurrent second-trimester abortions [00:00:46].

## Diagnosis of Cervical Insufficiency
The [[diagnosis_of_cervical_incompetence | diagnosis of cervical incompetence]] can be made based on patient history or ultrasound findings [00:00:55].

*   **History-Based Diagnosis**
    *   If a patient reports two or more painless second-trimester abortions, it confirms [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] without requiring further investigations [00:01:04].
    *   If there is a history of only one painless second-trimester abortion, a transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is necessary [00:01:32].
*   **Ultrasound-Based Diagnosis**
    *   The investigation of choice for [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical incompetence]] is TVS [00:02:02].
    *   On TVS, a cervical length of less than or equal to 2.5 cm is indicative of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] [00:01:42], [00:02:09]. A normal cervical length in a pregnant female is 4 cm [00:02:14].
    *   The shape of the cervix also changes with dilation:
        1.  Initially T-shaped [00:02:59].
        2.  Progresses to Y-shaped [00:03:01].
        3.  Then V-shaped [00:03:03].
        4.  Finally, it becomes U-shaped as it incorporates into the lower uterine segment [00:03:05], [00:03:19].

## Indications for Cervical Circlage
[[Management of Cervical Insufficiency | Management of cervical insufficiency]] involves either progesterone therapy or [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical cerclage]] [00:03:23]. Progesterone is typically administered alongside [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical cerclage]] [00:04:05].

[[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | Cervical circlage]] is indicated in specific scenarios:

*   **History of Multiple Abortions**
    *   If a pregnant female has a history of two or more previous second-trimester abortions, [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical circlage]] is indicated directly, without the need for an ultrasound [00:03:39].
*   **History of One Abortion with Short Cervix**
    *   If a pregnant female has a history of one second-trimester abortion, her cervical length should be measured [00:04:09].
    *   If the cervical length is less than or equal to 2.5 cm, [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical circlage]] is performed in combination with progesterone [00:04:20].
*   **Progesterone-Only Management**
    *   If a patient has a history of one second-trimester abortion, but the cervical length is more than 2.5 cm, only progesterone is given (circlage is not indicated in this specific case) [00:04:37].
    *   If there is no history of abortion, but the cervical length is found to be less than 2.5 cm (considered a coincidental finding), only progesterone is given; [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical circlage]] is not justified [00:05:07].

### Timing of Cervical Circlage
The optimal time for performing [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | cervical circlage]] is between 14 to 16 weeks of gestation [00:09:55]. It can be done as early as 12 weeks and up to a maximum of 24 weeks [00:09:59].

## Cervical Circlage Techniques
[[Management of Cervical Insufficiency | Cervical circlage]] can be performed in both pregnant and non-pregnant females [00:05:52].

### Transvaginal Circlage
Transvaginal approaches are common in pregnant females. A monofilament non-absorbable suture is used [00:06:09], [00:09:45].

*   **McDonald Circlage**
    *   Most commonly performed transvaginal [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] [00:06:03], [00:09:40].
    *   Involves applying purse-string sutures on the portio vaginalis (the vaginal part of the cervix) [00:06:14].
*   **Shirodkar Circlage**
    *   Mentioned as another transvaginal technique [00:06:55].
*   **Wurm Circlage (Emergency/Rescue Circlage)**
    *   Used as an emergency [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] when the patient's cervix is already dilated [00:06:59].
    *   Involves placing two stitches, anterior-posterior [00:07:20]. The prognosis for this type of [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] is not as favorable [00:07:13], [00:10:31].

### Transabdominal Circlage
This technique is also known as Benson and Deery [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] [00:07:32]. It can be performed laparoscopically [00:07:35] and is used in both pregnant and non-pregnant females [00:07:37].

*   **Indications**: Failed transvaginal [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] [00:07:43].
*   **Drawbacks**:
    *   It is an abdominal surgery [00:07:48].
    *   The sutures are typically not removed until the family is complete [00:08:02].
    *   Patients with an abdominal [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] in place require a Cesarean section for delivery [00:08:12].

### Non-Pregnant Female Procedures
*   **Lash and Lash Procedure**
    *   Performed vaginally in non-pregnant females [00:08:28].
    *   Involves removing a part of the defective cervix and then stitching it [00:08:33].
    *   Makes the cervix very fragile, necessitating a 3-month gap before conception and delivery via Cesarean section due to the cutting of the cervix [00:08:50].
    *   This procedure has many complications and is generally not performed currently; laparoscopic [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | circlage]] is preferred in non-pregnant females [00:09:06].

## Contraindications for Cervical Circlage
There are several [[contraindications_for_cervical_circlage | contraindications for applying cervical circlage]]:

*   Ruptured membranes [00:10:14]
*   Chorioamnionitis (infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) [00:10:16]
*   Vaginal bleeding [00:10:18]
*   Uterine contractions (indicating onset of labor) [00:10:19]
*   Cervical dilation more than or equal to 3 cm [00:10:37]
*   Gross congenital anomalies of the fetus [00:10:41]
*   Current pelvic infection [00:10:43]
*   Placenta previa is considered a relative [[contraindications_for_cervical_circlage | contraindication]] [00:10:47].

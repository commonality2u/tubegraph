## Question Analysis

### Bacteriological Loop Sterilization

*   **Question**: Bacteriological loops used for culture media inoculation are sterilized by which of the following methods? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   Options: Autoclave, placing in flame three times, placing in flame till it becomes red hot, microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Placing in flame till it becomes red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: In a [[microbiology_exam_recall | Microbiology]] lab, bacteriological loops are commonly sterilized by heating them in a flame until they are red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While autoclaving is possible, it's impractical for repeated sterilization needed for every culture medium inoculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, especially given the cost of platinum or nichrome loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Passing slides and coverslips through a flame three times is typically for disinfection, not sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Necrotizing Fasciitis Etiology

*   **Question**: A 20-year-old develops a bullae that progressed quickly to necrotizing fasciitis. Gram-positive cocci in chains were seen on microscopy of the exudate. Which of the following is the most likely etiology? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   Options: *Streptococcus*, *Staphylococcus*, *Styphlococcus*, *Micrococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Streptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The key hint is "gram-positive cocci in chains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A beta-hemolytic *Streptococcus*) is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
        *   *Staphylococcus* would appear as gram-positive cocci in clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
        *   *Micrococcus* would be arranged as gram-positive cocci in tetrads (sets of fours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
        *   *Diplococcus* (implied by "ocus") would be arranged in pairs, usually at an angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Farmer's Wound Infection

*   **Question**: A farmer comes with a wound acquired a couple of weeks back following blunt trauma from a farming tool. Microscopy of the wound exudate showed weakly acid-fast beaded filamentous rods. What is the most likely etiology? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
    *   Options: *Nocardia*, *Bacillus anthracis*, *Listeria*, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Nocardia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The description "weakly acid-fast beaded filamentous rods" is characteristic of *Nocardia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Filamentous rods showing branching suggest the family Actinomycetales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Key differences between *Nocardia* and *Actinomyces*:
        *   *Nocardia* is weakly acid-fast (using 0.5-1% sulfuric acid as decolorizer) and aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It causes exogenously acquired infections as environmental saprophytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.# Microbiology MCQs from INICET November 2024 Exam

    *   Options: Autoclave, placing in flame three times, placing in flame till it becomes red hot, microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Placing in flame till it becomes red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: In a [[microbiology_exam_recall | Microbiology]] lab, bacteriological loops are commonly sterilized by heating them in a flame until they are red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While autoclaving is possible, it's impractical for repeated sterilization needed for every culture medium inoculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, especially given the cost of platinum or nichrome loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Passing slides and coverslips through a flame three times is typically for disinfection, not sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Necrotizing Fasciitis Etiology

*   **Question**: A 20-year-old develops a bullae that progressed quickly to necrotizing fasciitis. Gram-positive cocci in chains were seen on microscopy of the exudate. Which of the following is the most likely etiology? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   Options: *Streptococcus*, *Staphylococcus*, *Styphlococcus*, *Micrococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Streptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The key hint is "gram-positive cocci in chains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A beta-hemolytic *Streptococcus*) is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

        *   *Micrococcus* would be arranged as gram-positive cocci in tetrads (sets of fours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
        *   *Diplococcus* (implied by "ocus") would be arranged in pairs, usually at an angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Farmer's Wound Infection

*   **Question**: A farmer comes with a wound acquired a couple of weeks back following blunt trauma from a farming tool. Microscopy of the wound exudate showed weakly acid-fast beaded filamentous rods. What is the most likely etiology of this infection? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
    *   Options: *Nocardia*, *Bacillus anthracis*, *Listeria*, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Nocardia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The description "weakly acid-fast beaded filamentous rods" is characteristic of *Nocardia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Filamentous rods showing branching suggest the family Actinomycetales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Key differences between *Nocardia* and *Actinomyces*:
        *   *Nocardia* is weakly acid-fast (using 0.5-1% sulfuric acid as decolorizer) and aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It causes exogenously acquired infections as environmental saprophytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
        *   *Actinomyces* is not acid-fast and is anaerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It causes endogenous infections as normal flora in the oral cavity, GI tract, or female vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   Other options:
        *   *Bacillus anthracis* is a gram-positive rod but does not show slender or branching morphology and is not acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
        *   *Listeria* is a gram-positive rod but not acid-fast, branching, or filamentous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
        *   *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is acid-fast (with 20% sulfuric acid) but does not have the filamentous morphology described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* Culture Medium

*   **Question**: Which culture medium is used for the isolation of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
    *   **Answer**: Lowenstein Jensen's (LJ) medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: LJ medium is an egg-containing, green medium typically dispensed in a McCartney's bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The selective agent that gives it its green color and inhibits unwanted bacteria is malachite green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Due to their long generation time (14-15 hours), *M. tuberculosis* takes 3 to 8 weeks to form colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The colony morphology is described as "rough, tough, and buff" (off-white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing

*   **Question**: Which of the following is a test for carrying out antibiotic sensitivity testing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
    *   Options: Camp test, E-test, Latex agglutination, Alex test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Answer**: E-test (Epsilometer test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The E-test uses plastic strips impregnated with a graded concentration of antibiotic placed on a Muller Hinton Agar plate inoculated with a bacterial lawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. After overnight incubation, ellipsoidal zones of inhibition are observed, and where the zone intersects the strip, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The E-test is a quantitative test that determines the MIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Comparison to Kirby-Bauer**: The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test is more commonly used due to its lower cost and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. It uses discs impregnated with a single standardized concentration of antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, and zones of inhibition determine if the organism is sensitive, intermediate, or resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, it does not determine the MIC, making it a qualitative test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
    *   **Other Options**:
        *   **CAMP Test**: Used for identification of Group B beta-hemolytic *Streptococcus* (*Streptococcus agalactiae*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. It shows enhanced zones of beta hemolysis (arrowhead hemolysis) when co-streaked with *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. It is also positive for *Listeria monocytogenes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
        *   **Elek Gel Precipitation Test**: Used to determine the toxigenicity of *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. It involves a filter paper strip with diphtheria antitoxin and streaks of known toxigenic, non-toxigenic, and test isolates, producing lines of precipitate if toxin is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This is a double diffusion in two dimensions (Ouchterlony test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
        *   **Latex Agglutination Test**: Latex particles coated with antibodies are mixed with a patient specimen to detect specific antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. An example is detecting the capsular antigen of *Cryptococcus* in CSF or blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Matching Diseases with Etiological Agents

*   **Question**: Match the disease with the etiological agents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>
*   **Matches**:
    *   **Donovanosis** (also called Granuloma Inguinale) is caused by *Klebsiella granulomatis* (formerly *Calymmatobacterium granulomatis*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   **Oroya Fever** (also called Carrion's Disease) is reported mainly from South America, transmitted by sand fly bite, and caused by *Bartonella bacilliformis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Rat Bite Fever** is caused by *Streptobacillus moniliformis* (in the Western world) and *Spirillum minus* (in Asia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
    *   **Pinta** is caused by *Treponema carateum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Water-Borne Hepatitis

*   **Question**: Which of the following is primarily a water-borne disease? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>
    *   Options: Hepatitis A, B, C, and D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Hepatitis A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: Hepatitis A and E are water-borne, remembered by the mnemonic "Hepatitis with a vowel comes from the bowel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Other hepatitis viruses are transmitted by different routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Vaccine-Preventable Cancers

*   **Question**: Which of the following cancers can be prevented by vaccination? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>
    *   Options: Cervical, Burkitt lymphoma, Merkel cell lymphoma, Hepatocellular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Cervical cancer and Hepatocellular carcinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**:
        *   **Cervical cancer** is caused by Human Papillomaviruses (HPV), particularly high-risk types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Vaccines like Gardasil (quadrivalent against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, and nonavalent Gardasil 9 against 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 in addition to the original four) contain the major capsid protein (L1 protein) synthesized by recombinant techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
        *   **Hepatocellular carcinoma** can be prevented by the Hepatitis B vaccine, which contains the Australia antigen (HBs antigen or surface antigen) synthesized by recombinant methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
        *   **Merkel cell carcinoma** is caused by polyomaviruses, but there is no vaccine against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
        *   **Burkitt Lymphoma** is caused by Epstein-Barr virus, and there is no vaccine available yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

### Gardener's Subcutaneous Nodules

*   **Question**: A gardener who is a resident of the sub-Himalayan belt presents with painless subcutaneous nodules and shallow ulcers on the arm. Axillary lymph nodes are enlarged. Aspirate from the lymph nodes show elongated yeasts (3-5 microns). Culture on fungal medium at 22°C showed the image of the colony isolated. The lpcb mount is shown. What is the likely diagnosis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>
    *   Options: Sporotrichosis, Chromoblastomycosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Histoplasmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Sporotrichosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The history of a "gardener" or "rose gardener" from the sub-Himalayan belt with subcutaneous nodules is classic for Sporotrichosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. *Sporothrix schenckii* is a dimorphic fungus; it appears as elongated (cigar-shaped) yeasts in tissue biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> and converts to its mold form at 22°C, showing hyaline septate hyphae with "rosettes of conidia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. It is acquired by trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Farmer's Foot Swelling

*   **Question**: A farmer presents with swelling of the foot. He gives a history of always walking barefoot. On examination, there are multiple ulcers or sinuses. Which of the following infection could have been acquired by farming due to walking barefoot? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>
    *   Options: Mycetoma, Coccidioides, Aspergillus fumigatus, Ceraria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Mycetoma (Madura foot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: Swelling of the foot with multiple sinuses and a history of walking barefoot is characteristic of Mycetoma, also known as Madura foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. There are two types:
        *   **Actinomycetoma**: Caused by filamentous branching bacteria like *Nocardia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
        *   **Eumycetoma**: Caused by fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
    *   Both types can be acquired by walking barefoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### *Cryptococcus* True Statements

*   **Question**: Which of the following is true about *Cryptococcus*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>
    *   Options: Pathogenic species are urease positive; *Cryptococcus gattii* is associated with bird guano; Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis is an AIDS-defining illness; Opportunistic infection is seen in AIDS when CD4 counts fall below 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis is an AIDS-defining illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**:
        *   All *Cryptococcus* species, pathogenic or non-pathogenic, are urease positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
        *   *Cryptococcus gattii* is associated with eucalyptus trees and the soil around them, not bird guano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. *Cryptococcus neoformans* is associated with soil contaminated with bird excreta/guano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
        *   Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis, such as cryptococcal meningitis, is indeed an AIDS-defining illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
        *   Opportunistic infections in AIDS usually occur when CD4 counts fall below 100, not 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
    *   **Note**: The two pathogenic species are *C. neoformans* (capsular serotypes A and D) and *C. gattii* (capsular serotypes B and C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### Child with Watery Diarrhea

*   **Question**: A 2-year-old child presents with watery diarrhea. On examination, the baby is severely dehydrated. Which is the most likely cause? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>
*   **Answer**: Rotavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: In children less than 5 years of age, Rotavirus is the primary etiological agent causing diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Although enteropathogenic *E. coli* can cause infantile diarrheas and is the most common bacterial cause, Rotavirus is the undisputed most common cause of diarrhea in children overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Rotaviruses have a distinctive wheel-shaped morphology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

### Child with Diarrhea & Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)

*   **Question**: A child is brought to the emergency with complaints of diarrhea for the last 3 days. There is blood in the urine. Investigations reveal thrombocytopenia. What is the most common cause? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>
    *   Options: *E. coli* O157:H7 or Enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *E. coli* O157:H7 (or EHEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: The presentation of diarrhea complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), indicated by hematuria (blood in urine) and thrombocytopenia, points to Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli*, most commonly *E. coli* O157:H7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This is a classic [[clinical_vignette_based_mcqs_in_microbiology | clinical vignette-based MCQ]].

### Urethritis Causes

*   **Question**: A male patient presents with urethritis. It can be caused by all except: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>
    *   Options: *Trichomonas vaginalis*, *Gardnerella vaginalis*, *Mycoplasma genitalium*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Gardnerella vaginalis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**:
        *   *Chlamydia trachomatis* (serovars D-K) is the most common cause of urethritis (though not an option here) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
        *   *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Mycoplasma genitalium*, and *Trichomonas vaginalis* can all cause urethritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.
        *   *Gardnerella vaginalis* primarily causes bacterial vaginosis in females, not urethritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### *Ascaris lumbricoides* Incorrect Statement

*   **Question**: Which of the following is wrong about *Ascaris lumbricoides*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>
    *   Options: Massive infection can cause rectal prolapse; Most infections are asymptomatic; Eggs and stools are non-infective and need time in soil to become infective; Asthma-like conditions can be seen following infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Massive infection can cause rectal prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**:
        *   *Ascaris lumbricoides* (common roundworm) resides in the small intestines and does not cause rectal prolapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Rectal prolapse from massive infection is caused by *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
        *   Most *Ascaris* infections are asymptomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
        *   Fertilized *Ascaris* eggs passed in stool are unsegmented (non-infective) and need to mature in soil for the filariform larva to develop and become infective to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
        *   *Ascaris* larvae migrating through the lungs can precipitate asthma-like symptoms, a condition known as Löffler's syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The larvae are ingested, penetrate the GI mucosa, reach portal circulation, then the right heart, and pass through the lungs before being swallowed and maturing in the small intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### Abdominal Pain and Liver Cyst

*   **Question**: A patient presents with abdominal pain. On examination, there is a mass palpable in the right hypochondrium. Ultrasound showed a cystic lesion in the liver. Ultrasound-guided aspiration was done and microscopy of the aspirate is shown. What is the most likely infection? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>
    *   Options: *Taenia solium*, *Echinococcus granulosus*, *Hymenolepis nana*, *Taenia saginata* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Answer**: *Echinococcus granulosus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: Abdominal pain, a palpable mass in the right hypochondrium, and a cystic lesion in the liver strongly suggest hydatid disease (hydatid cyst) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. Hydatid cysts are caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Although aspiration of hydatid cysts is generally avoided due to the risk of anaphylactic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, the microscopy image would show hydatid sand, including protoscolices with rostellum and hooklets, which is diagnostic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
    *   *Echinococcus granulosus* is a cestode where humans are never the definitive host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. The adult worm is found in the small intestines of dogs (definitive host) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. Humans acquire the infection by accidental ingestion of eggs from dog feces, leading to the formation of hydatid cysts, most often in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. The cyst consists of a pericyst, ectocyst, and endocyst (germinal layer), from which brood capsules containing scolices arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Naive T-Cell Activation

*   **Question**: Which of the following is not involved in the development of a naive T-cell to an activated helper T-cell? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>
    *   Options: T-cell interaction with antigen-presenting cell; Interaction between CD28 and CD28 ligand; PD-1 on T-cell interaction with PDL1 ligand on antigen-presenting cell; Cytokine-mediated proliferation and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Answer**: PD-1 on T-cell interaction with PDL1 ligand on antigen-presenting cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**: T-cell activation requires three signals:
        1.  **Signal 1**: T-cell receptor (TCR) on the naive helper T-cell recognizes the peptide antigen presented in the groove of MHC Class II on an antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as a dendritic cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
        2.  **Signal 2**: Co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of CD28 on the helper T-cell to its ligand (CD28 ligand, also known as B7.1/B7.2 or CD80/CD86) on the APC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
        3.  **Signal 3**: Cytokines secreted by the APC, which drive the differentiation of the helper T-cell into specific subsets (e.g., IL-12 for Th1, IL-4 for Th2, IL-1, IL-6, IL-22 for Th17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
    *   The interaction between PD-1 (on the T-cell) and PDL1 (on the APC) is an inhibitory signal that prevents T-cell activation, rather than promoting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.

### Passive Immunity

*   **Question**: Which of the following when administered to a patient does not impart passive immunity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>
    *   Options: Monoclonal antibody, immunoglobulin, antitoxin, toxoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.
*   **Answer**: Toxoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
    *   **Explanation**:
        *   **Passive immunity** involves administering preformed antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibody, immunoglobulin, antitoxin) to a patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This provides immediate but temporary protection.
        *   **Toxoid** (e.g., diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid) is an inactivated toxin that acts as an antigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. When administered, it induces the patient's immune system to produce its own antibodies, thus conferring active (specifically, artificial active) immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

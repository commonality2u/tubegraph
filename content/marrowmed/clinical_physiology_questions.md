Physiology questions in the recently concluded [[pathology_questions_in_inict_november_2024_exam | INI CET November session]] were predominantly clinical and application-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While questions may appear new, a clear understanding of concepts allows for accurate derivation of answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Strong conceptual foundations are crucial for success in future examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Principles for Answering

The ultimate theme for all future exams is to be very clear and strong in your concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Even if a question seems difficult, applying strong concepts can lead to the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Immediately, the relevant concept should flash in your mind when encountering a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Examples from INI CET November Session

### Mechanical Nociceptors and Pain Sensation

A picture-based MCQ involved mechanical nociceptors and their response to different stimuli: a blunt object, a pinprick, and a tooth forceps stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Pinprick and Tooth Forceps**: Stimulate pain receptors (nociceptors), with tooth forceps causing maximum pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Blunt Force**: Does not stimulate nociceptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Instead, it applies pressure sensation, which can activate Pacinian corpuscles, a form of deep touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Pain Fiber Types**: Sharp pain is carried by A-delta fibers, while slow pain is carried by C fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Enteric Nervous System

The enteric nervous system is considered a "little brain" because it can function independently of the brain and spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Afferents from Gut**: Both vagal (parasympathetic) and sympathetic nerves (via prevertebral ganglia) contribute afferents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Myenteric Plexus**: Located between the longitudinal and circular muscles, not in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: Not exclusively under nervous influence; gastrointestinal hormones like gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, and serotonin can also activate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Connection to CNS**: Both parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system connect the enteric system to the central nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Lower Motor Neuron Lesions

Lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions affect alpha and gamma motor neurons, which directly supply skeletal muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Predominant Findings**: Skeletal muscle findings are predominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Fasciculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
    *   Hypotonia (decreased muscle tone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
    *   Atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
    *   Reduced muscle tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   **Distinguishing from Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) Lesions**:
    *   **Babinski Sign**: Negative (plantar flexion) in LMN lesions, positive (dorsiflexion of great toe) in UMN lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Paralysis**: Spastic paralysis in UMN lesions, flaccid paralysis in LMN lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **Tone**: Spasticity in UMN, reduced tone in LMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   **Weakness Distribution**: Regional in UMN (e.g., hemiplegia), segmental in LMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Reflexes**: Hyperactive/exaggerated in UMN, hypoactive/absent in LMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.### Decompression Sickness (Caisson's Disease)

Decompression sickness, also known as Caisson's disease, is caused by nitrogen gas bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Rapid decompression causes dissolved nitrogen gas to come out of solution as bubbles, similar to opening a carbonated drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Effects**: Nitrogen can cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to nitrogen narcosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Bubbles can affect joints (leading to "the bends"), lungs (causing "the chokes" or difficulty breathing), and blood vessels (leading to gas embolism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Virchow's Triad**: The nitrogen bubbles can cause endothelial injury, stasis of blood flow due to occlusion, and hypercoagulability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Hemoconcentration vs. Hemodilution**: Endothelial injury and capillary leak lead to extravasation of plasma, resulting in hemoconcentration, not hemodilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

### Static Two-Point Discrimination (Touch Receptors)

Touch receptors are frequently asked in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Static two-point discrimination is primarily attributed to slowly adapting receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Merkel Cells**: Best answer for two-point discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. They are superficial, highly sensitive to edges and corners (important for Braille reading), and are slowly adapting receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Meissner Corpuscles**: Superficial, sensitive to gentle strokes (e.g., ant crawling on skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. They are rapidly adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Pacinian Corpuscles**: Deep, sensitive to pressure and vibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. They are rapidly adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Ruffini Endings**: Deep, sensitive to skin stretch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. They are slowly adapting receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

### Sarcomere/Filaments (Muscle Contraction)

The sarcomere is a universal topic in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Z-line**: Forms the boundary of a sarcomere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   **I-band**: Light band, formed predominantly by actin (thin filaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **A-band**: Dark band, formed by myosin (thick filaments) and overlapping actin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **H-zone**: Region within the A-band where there is no overlap between actin and myosin filaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **M-line**: Line in the center of the H-zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Hormone Receptors

This is a frequently asked topic in [[endocrinology_and_nephrology_in_exams | endocrinology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Insulin**: Binds to a tyrosine kinase receptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Acetylcholine**: Binds to a ligand-gated ion channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Growth Hormone/Erythropoietin**: Act via the JAK-STAT pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Thyroxine**: Binds to a direct nuclear receptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve

Transfusion of stored blood causes a left shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **Left Shift Causes**:
    *   Falling CO2 (hypocarbia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>
    *   Falling H+ ions (rising pH, alkalosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>
    *   Fetal hemoglobin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>
    *   Carbon monoxide poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>
    *   Falling 2,3-DPG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>
*   **Stored Blood**: Leads to falling 2,3-DPG, hence a left shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. To prevent this, blood is stored in CPDA (citrate phosphate dextrose adenine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

### Peripheral Chemoreceptors

Peripheral chemoreceptors are most sensitive to hypoxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Glomus Cells**: These cells, unique to peripheral chemoreceptors, act as oxygen sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: They possess oxygen-sensitive potassium channels, allowing them to sense hypoxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

GFR is influenced by Starling forces, adhering to Newton's third law (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Forces Favoring Filtration**:
    *   Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillaries (PC): typically 60 mmHg; increase in PC increases GFR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
*   **Forces Opposing Filtration**:
    *   Oncotic pressure in glomerular capillaries: typically 32 mmHg due to proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
    *   Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space: typically 18 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
    *   Decrease in these opposing forces (oncotic or Bowman's hydrostatic pressure) increases GFR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Net Filtration Pressure**: (60) - (32 + 18) = 10 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Filtration Coefficient (Kf)**: GFR = Kf × Net Filtration Pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Normal Kf is 12.5 (125 mL/min / 10 mmHg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
    *   Kf is determined by glomerular capillary surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
    *   A decrease in glomerular filtration coefficient (Kf) decreases GFR, e.g., due to destruction of glomerular capillaries in diabetes mellitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. This is a common question in [[endocrinology_and_nephrology_in_exams | nephrology]].

### Physiological Dead Space

Physiological dead space (PDS) is a frequently asked topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Measured by the Bohr equation, not spirometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
*   **Relationship to Anatomical Dead Space**: In healthy individuals, PDS equals anatomical dead space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Representation**: Represents inadequately perfused alveoli (wasted ventilation), where ventilation occurs but blood flow for gas exchange is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

### Latent Period of Muscle Twitch

The latent period is the small time gap between a stimulus and the onset of muscle contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
*   **Contributing Factors**:
    *   Generation of nerve impulse/action potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>
    *   Neuromuscular transmission (release of acetylcholine, action at receptors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>
    *   Excitation-contraction coupling (calcium influx, troponin C binding, actin-myosin interaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>
*   **Non-Contributing Factor**: Reuptake of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a process for muscle relaxation, not the latent period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Transport Mechanisms (Passive Processes)

Passive processes do not require energy (ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Simple Diffusion**: A passive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   **Facilitated Diffusion**: A passive process that uses transport proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Paracellular Pathway**: Movement of substances in between two cells (sideway or lateral movement) by diffusion, making it a passive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Active Transport**: Requires energy (e.g., sodium-potassium pump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The INI CET examination shows a clear inference: most questions are derived from previous year topics but are slightly twisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Even new questions can be solved if one is conceptually strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. For example, understanding [[common_topics_in_pathology_exams | Virchow's triad]] can be applied to Caisson's disease to deduce hemoconcentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. The key is to apply concepts rather than just recalling direct facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Strong conceptual foundations are vital for cracking exams and achieving career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

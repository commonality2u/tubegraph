Dr. Akhil, who achieved an All India Rank 6 in the November INI CET 2024, shares his [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] and [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | effective revision techniques for medical exams]] for competitive medical exams. He outlines a systematic [[approach_to_medical_exams_and_strategy | approach to medical exams and strategy]] that focuses on early preparation, conceptual clarity, and consistent practice.

## Starting Early & Building Foundation
Dr. Akhil recommends starting NEET PG preparation from the third year of MBBS, ideally from the fifth semester (end of second year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:11">[02:10:11]</a>. The focus in the early years should be on building concepts for crucial second-year subjects like Pathology, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, as these are fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:33">[03:30:33]</a>. He emphasizes making a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Resources & Note-Making
Dr. Akhil used video lectures and created notes from the third year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
His [[study_techniques_for_medical_exams | study techniques for medical exams]] included:
-   Watching video lectures for various subjects and making notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
-   Solving topic-specific question banks immediately after completing a video lecture on that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
-   Prioritizing major subjects like Medicine, Surgery, and Obstetrics & Gynaecology, as they form core concepts and are crucial for exam results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
-   Minimizing time spent on short subjects, recommending only two days of classes for them and focusing on their previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
-   Making handwritten notes for smaller subjects (like ENT and Ophthalmology) and using printed notes for larger subjects (like Obs-Gynae and Surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Notes Compilation
> All material for last-moment revision should ideally be in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Dr. Akhil added important points, missed questions, and confusing concepts directly into his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

## Question Practice and Testing
Consistent practice with questions and tests is a cornerstone of his [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | strategies for maximizing performance during exam time]]:
-   **Custom Modules:** He found Marrow's custom modules to be the most useful feature, allowing flexibility to practice specific topics or subjects with specific tags (e.g., previous year questions, clinical tags) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.
-   **Grand Tests (GTs):** Started giving GTs regularly during internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>.
    -   Focused on reviewing incorrect answers to avoid repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.
    -   Used analytics to identify weaker areas and worked on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
    -   Emphasized consistency in giving GTs, even if performance fluctuates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.
    -   Skipped GTs when internship duties were hectic but compensated with subject-wise tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.
    -   Stressed that GTs are a measurement of progress, not a definitive judgment of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.
    -   Giving GTs improves preparation and aids in revision, as it forces revision of all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>.

## Revision Philosophy
Dr. Akhil's [[effective_revision_tactics_for_medical_exams | effective revision tactics for medical exams]] were strategic and selective:
-   **Selective Reading:** After the first read, he focused on important topics and those frequently asked in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Less important topics were quickly reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
-   **Bookmark Feature:** Initially, he overused the bookmark feature, leading to too many questions to review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. He advises juniors to bookmark selectively after the first read, focusing only on important or weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, especially previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.
-   **Revision Notes/Videos:** He utilized revision notes and videos, especially during internship, to filter down important information that faculty had already curated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
-   **Consistency of Source:** Strongly recommended sticking to the same faculty for both main and revision videos to maintain synchrony and avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

## Mindset and Consistency
Dr. Akhil emphasizes the mental aspect of preparation:
-   **Be Selective:** For competitive exams, it's crucial to be selective and master previous year topics, letting go of the fear of missing out (FOMO) on less important topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
-   **Focus on Retention:** "It is not important how much you have read, ultimately what matters is how much you remember, how much you can revise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.
-   **Believe in Efforts:** Efforts never go to waste; consistency and belief in one's hard work will eventually yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.
-   **Systematic Approach:** Advised juniors to follow a systematic approach:
    1.  First read: Read notes once and solve topic-wise previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>, highlighting mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>.
    2.  Second read: Focus on previous year question bank, becoming more subject-wise instead of topic-wise, and review mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
    3.  Final cycle: Do grand tests covering all 19 subjects to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>.

The diagnosis of pneumothorax frequently appears in medical examinations, highlighting its importance in clinical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This condition involves the accumulation of air in the pleural space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, leading to lung collapse and impaired oxygenation.

## Clinical Presentation Clues

Patients presenting with a suspected pneumothorax, particularly in the context of an acute exacerbation of [[Spirometry and lung function | COPD]] (obstructive lung diseases), may exhibit several key signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>:
*   **Saturation Drop:** A consistent drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a significant indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. In patients on mechanical ventilation, saturation may not be maintained due to the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Reduced Chest Wall Movement:** The affected side of the chest may show reduced movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Radiological Signs of Pneumothorax

A chest X-ray is crucial for confirming the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. A classic chest X-ray picture of pneumothorax reveals distinct findings on the affected side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. It is imperative for students to be able to identify pneumothorax on a chest X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Auscultatory Findings

On auscultation, specific findings are indicative of pneumothorax:
*   **Absent or Decreased Breath Sounds:** On the affected side, there will be no or decreased air entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This means normal vesicular breath sounds heard on the unaffected side would be absent on the affected side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Bronchial breath sounds would not be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Decreased Vocal Fremitus/Resonance:** Vocal fremitus is also typically decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Percussion Findings

When percussing the chest wall, a [[Radiological signs and their significance in clinical diagnosis | hyperresonant note]] can be heard on the affected side due to the accumulation of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Associated Conditions and Management Considerations

Pneumothorax can develop in patients with obstructive lung diseases, especially when on mechanical ventilation, due to the decreased elasticity of the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. If pneumothorax is present, positive pressure ventilation will worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

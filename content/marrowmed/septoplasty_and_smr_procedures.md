Septoplasty and Submucous Resection (SMR) are corrective surgical procedures performed for [[Nasal Obstruction and Deviated Nasal Septum | deviated nasal septum]] (DNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. They address issues like nasal obstruction, headaches, and sleep disturbances due to snoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Septoplasty

Septoplasty is considered a more conservative surgery compared to SMR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Procedure Details
During septoplasty, an incision is given at the lower border of the septal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The mucosal and perichondral flap is raised on one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Only the deviated part of the septum is removed, making it a very conservative surgery where "everything that is good" is preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Incision Type
The incision used for septoplasty is known as Friar's Incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Indications in Children
While septal surgeries are typically not performed in children under 17 years old due to the risk of damaging secondary centers of ossification, septoplasty may be preferred if severe symptoms like sleep disturbances are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Submucous Resection (SMR)

SMR is a less conservative procedure than septoplasty, with higher associated complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Procedure Details
In SMR, an L-shaped strut of cartilage is left behind, specifically superiorly and inferiorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The incision is given approximately 1 cm above the lower border of the septal cartilages, and a larger portion of the septum is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Incision Type
The incision used for SMR is known as Killian's Incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

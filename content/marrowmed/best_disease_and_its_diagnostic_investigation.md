Best disease is a fundus dystrophy, specifically a macular dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>. It is also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy due to the characteristic egg yolk-like lesion observed in the macula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

## Clinical Features
Since the macula primarily contains cone cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, Best disease primarily affects cone function, leading to loss of vision in daytime, also known as hemeralopia or day blindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## Diagnostic Investigation

The diagnostic investigation of choice for Best disease is Electrooculography (EOG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### Electrooculography (EOG)
EOG measures the Arden's ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. A normal Arden's ratio is typically greater than 1.85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. In cases of Best dystrophy, the Arden's ratio becomes less than 1.5 or less than 150% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>, making it a key diagnostic indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Electroretinography (ERG)
In contrast to EOG, Electroretinography (ERG) is found to be absolutely normal in Best disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. ERG is the investigation of choice for other retinal dystrophies like [[retinitis_pigmentosa | Retinitis Pigmentosa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>, which is primarily a rod cell dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

### Visual Evoked Potential (VEP)
Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is used to differentiate between organic and functional visual loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. It essentially functions as an EEG for the occipital lobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **Functional Visual Loss**: This refers to patients pretending to have visual loss (malingering or hysteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. In these cases, the visual pathway and occipital lobe are intact, and normal VEPs are generated despite the patient's complaint of no vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Organic Blindness**: This is typically caused by a bilateral occipital lobe lesion, where there is no vision, but the patient may feel there is vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

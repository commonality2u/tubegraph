Onychomycosis refers to a [[fungal_and_bacterial_infections | fungal infection]] of the nail unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:34">[03:58:34]</a>.

## Presentation
A patient suspected of having onychomycosis might present with significant discoloration and subungual hyperkeratosis, which causes surface changes to the nail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:12">[03:49:12]</a>.

## Antifungal Treatments
Treatment for onychomycosis can involve topical, oral, or parenteral [[antimicrobial_treatments | antimicrobial treatments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:50">[04:09:50]</a>.

### Topical Agents
Topical antifungals are used for onychomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:50">[04:09:50]</a>.
*   **Tavaborole**
    *   FDA-approved topical agent for onychomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:26">[05:33:26]</a>.
    *   Mechanism of Action: Tavaborole targets leucyl-tRNA synthetase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:09">[05:42:09]</a>, an enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of leucine to its respective transfer RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:18">[05:46:18]</a>. By inhibiting this attachment, it leads to the inhibition of fungal protein synthesis, resulting in cell death and clearance of the nail infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:30">[06:00:30]</a>.
    *   Available as a 5% solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:55">[06:33:55]</a>.
*   **Efinaconazole**
    *   Available as a 5% nail lacquer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:37">[06:15:37]</a>. Nail lacquers are a form of drug delivery system that helps in sustained drug release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:44">[06:23:44]</a>.
*   **Ciclopirox**
    *   Available as an 8% nail lacquer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:41">[06:17:41]</a>.
*   **Luliconazole**
    *   Available as a 10% solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:55">[06:33:55]</a>.

### Oral Agents
*   **Itraconazole** is an oral drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:03">[04:18:03]</a>.
*   **Griseofulvin**
    *   Regarded as the overall drug of choice in tinea capitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:05">[04:31:05]</a>.
    *   Can also be used in dermatophytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>.
    *   It is an oral drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

### Parenteral Agents
*   **Caspofungin**
    *   Belongs to a group of drugs called echinocandins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>.
    *   Echinocandins are generally used in invasive [[fungal_and_bacterial_infectios | fungal infections]] like invasive aspergillosis or invasive candidiasis, or generally for *Candida* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:06">[05:01:06]</a>.
    *   Other echinocandins include anidulafungin and micafungin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>.
    *   When used for invasive diseases, the route of administration is generally parenteral (e.g., intravenous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:35">[05:16:35]</a>.

Post dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a known complication that can occur following certain medical procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The procedure in question, [[lumbar_puncture_procedures_and_related_complications | lumbar puncture]], is performed by puncturing the dura mater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Prevalence

PDPH is common in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. It is predominantly observed in young adults rather than older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. A notable instance where PDPH is commonly seen is after cesarean sections, particularly affecting young females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

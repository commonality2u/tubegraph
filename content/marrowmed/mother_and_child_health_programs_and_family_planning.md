The May 2025 INI set exam included several easy-level community medicine questions, with approximately 20-25 questions in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Among these, [[maternal_and_child_health_programs | mother child health]], family planning, and demography consistently featured prominently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## RMNCH+A Strategy

The RMNCH+A strategy, implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aims to provide comprehensive healthcare across various life stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

*   **Target Demography**: The latest RMNCH+A includes:
    *   Mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
    *   Child health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
    *   Family planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Geriatric health is *not* included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Components of RMNCH+N**:
    *   **R**: Reproductive health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>
    *   **M**: Maternal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>
    *   **N**: Neonate or newborn health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>
    *   **C**: Child health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
    *   **A**: Adolescent health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>
    *   **N**: Nutrition (a prime focus area of the program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>

## Demography

### Dependency Ratio
The dependency ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of dependents by the total number of independent individuals, multiplied by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This ratio is usually expressed as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

*   **Dependent Population**: Individuals under 15 years and over 65 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Independent Population**: Individuals between 15 and 65 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

*Example Calculation*:
Given a population with:
*   6,000 individuals below 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
*   12,000 individuals between 15 and 65 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>
*   2,000 individuals more than 65 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>

Dependency Ratio = (6,000 + 2,000) / 12,000 * 100 = 8,000 / 12,000 * 100 = 0.667 * 100 = 66.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## Family Planning

### Intrauterine Device (IUD) Insertion Timing
The timing of intrauterine device (IUD) insertion varies based on the individual's obstetric status:
*   **Post-placental IUCD insertion**: Within 10 minutes of placenta delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Postpartum IUCD insertion**: After 10 minutes but within 48 hours of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Interval IUCD insertion**: After 6 weeks post-delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Non-pregnant, non-lactating female**: Typically within 10 days of the start of menstruation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

The best time for IUD insertion to achieve optimal contraceptive benefits is generally considered to be within 48 hours of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act

#### Consent for MTP
There is no specific minimum age for a female to undergo [[medical_termination_of_pregnancy_mtp_act_2021 | Medical Termination of Pregnancy]] (MTP) in cases of social injustice or unwanted pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. However, the minimum age for an individual to provide *consent* for their own MTP is 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. For minors (below 18 years) or individuals who are not mentally competent to make the decision, consent must be given by their legal guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

#### Doctor's Consent Requirements (MTP Act 2021)
As per the latest [[medical_termination_of_pregnancy_mtp_act_2021 | MTP Amendment Act 2021]] (revised in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>:
*   **Below 20 weeks**: Consent from a single doctor is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **20 to 24 weeks**: Consent from two registered medical practitioners is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **After 24 weeks**: MTP can be performed, but only with the approval of a state-level medical board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

## Nutrition

### Morasmus
Morasmus is a form of protein-energy malnutrition primarily characterized by severe calorie (energy) deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   It leads to severe muscle loss (muscle wasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   There is increased lipolysis (fat breakdown) and myolysis (muscle breakdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   Low total proteins and albumin levels are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   Unlike Kwashiorkor, edema is typically absent in Morasmus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Biostatistics in Health Research

### Test of Significance for Weight Difference
When analyzing the weight difference in a single group of patients (e.g., before and after nutritional counseling), the appropriate statistical test to use is a **paired t-test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Scenario**: A researcher measures the weight of 100 diabetes mellitus patients, provides nutritional counseling for 6 months, and then measures their weight again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Reasoning**: This involves a single group measured at two different time points, and weight is quantitative, normally distributed data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Types of Statistical Tests
Statistical tests are broadly categorized into parametric and non-parametric tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:

*   **Parametric Tests**: Used for quantitative data that is normally distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   **Single group**: Paired t-test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   **Two groups**: Unpaired t-test (also known as independent sample t-test or student t-test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   **Three or more groups**: ANOVA test (Analysis of Variance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

*   **Non-parametric Tests**: Used for qualitative data or non-normally distributed data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Single group (qualitative)**: MacNemar test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Two groups**: Chi-square test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Three or more groups**: Kruskal-Wallis test (for nominal data) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (for ordinal data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Sampling Methods

*   **Stratified Random Sampling**: This method involves dividing a population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on a third variable (e.g., low, medium, or high disease burden) and then selecting samples from each stratum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Dividing regions into low, medium, and high disease burden groups, and then selecting individuals from each group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

*   **Systematic Sampling**: Involves selecting every 'n-th' person or unit from a list (e.g., every 10th person) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Convenient Sampling**: A non-probability sampling method where samples are selected based on ease of access, which is generally not considered a robust sampling technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Simple Random Sampling**: Based on lottery methods or random number generation, where every individual has an equal chance of being selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

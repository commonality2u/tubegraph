## Sperm Anatomy
The sperm consists of a head, a small neck part, and a tail piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The tail piece is further divided into the middle piece (or midpiece), principal piece, and terminal piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Middle Piece (Midpiece)**: This is considered the "Powerhouse of the sperm" because it contains numerous mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The mitochondrial sheath is found in this part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Principal Piece**: This part of the sperm assists in motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Understanding the development of sperm falls under [[spermatogenesis | spermatogenesis]].

## Oocyte Development and Meiosis Arrest
The development of oocytes involves specific stages of meiosis arrest:
*   **Primordial Germ Cells**: These cells reach the genital ridge in females by the fifth week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. They immediately convert to oogonium through mitosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Primary Oocyte**: Oogonium converts to a primary oocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The primary oocyte then enters Meiosis I and becomes arrested in the diplotene phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This arrest lasts until puberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Secondary Oocyte**: After puberty, meiosis resumes, forming a secondary oocyte and the first polar body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The secondary oocyte enters Meiosis II and is arrested in metaphase for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Gastrulation and Germ Layer Formation
Gastrulation and neurulation are key events that occur during the third week of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
The formation of the primitive streak indicates the beginning of gastrulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Primitive Streak
*   The primitive streak is formed at the caudal end of the embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   It originates from the proliferation of epiblast cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   It forms around the 14th or 15th day, marking the end of the second week or the beginning of the third week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Sequence of Germ Layer Formation
All three primary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) are derived from the epiblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The sequence of [[germ_layer_formation | germ layer formation]] is:
1.  **Endoderm**: This is the first germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It replaces all the hypoblast cells, so by the third week, hypoblast cells are entirely replaced by endoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  **Mesoderm**: This is the second germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It is derived from the primitive streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Ectoderm**: The remaining epiblast cells form the ectoderm, making it the last (third) germ layer to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Prochordal Plate
The prochordal plate is a structure formed at the cranial end of the embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It consists of columnar hypoblast cells, which are typically cuboidal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The prochordal plate will form the bucco-pharyngeal membrane (or oro-pharyngeal membrane), which eventually ruptures to form the oral cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The oral cavity marks the future head end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Neural Crest Derivatives
[[neural_crest_derivatives | Neural crest derivatives]] are a diverse group of cells that migrate throughout the embryo to form various structures. A mnemonic to remember some of these derivatives is "MORTEL PASS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:
*   **M**: Melanocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   **O**: Odontoblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   **T**: Tracheal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> (also stromal cells)
*   **E**: Adrenal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **L**: Laryngeal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
*   **P**: Parafollicular cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   **A**: All ganglions (including adrenal medulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   **S**: Schwann cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **S**: Spiral membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

### Structures NOT derived from Neural Crest
The retina is not derived from neural crest cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Instead, the retina and optic nerve are continuations or extensions of the diencephalon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The diencephalon, in turn, is derived from the neural tube, which comes from the neuroectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Therefore, the retinal pigment epithelium is also not a derivative of neural crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

In the INICET November 2024 examination, only one psychiatry question was featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While some students might have been happy about this, the number of questions in this subject is expected to change in future sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The question was a basic match-the-following format, a type that has appeared multiple times in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## INICET November 2024 Psychiatry Question

The question required matching drugs with their respective uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Drugs and Their Uses

*   **Naloxone:** Used for opioid poisoning or opioid overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It is administered intravenously (IV) and functions as an opioid antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Oxazepam:** One of the key drugs (along with Lorazepam and Temazepam) used in [[Preparation strategy for INICET | alcohol withdrawal]], especially in patients with liver dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Varenicline:** A highly effective strategy for [[Pharmacology MCQs in INICET 2025 | nicotine cessation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Acamprosate:** Used to reduce craving for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Correct Pairings from the Exam

Based on the explanations, the correct pairings lead to choice 'B' as the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Related Concepts for Future Exams

Several related topics frequently appear in exams and are important to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Tobacco/Nicotine Cessation

#### Brief Intervention: The Five A's

This intervention framework has been previously asked in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
*   **Ask:** Inquire if every patient smokes or uses nicotine in any form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Advise:** Strongly recommend and advise them to stop nicotine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Assess:** Evaluate the level and frequency of nicotine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Assist:** Help patients in their attempt to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Arrange:** Schedule follow-up appointments to ensure accountability and maintain motivation, regardless of whether they have quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

#### Nicotine Supplementation Strategy (Nicotine Replacement Therapy - NRT)

NRT involves providing purified nicotine from an external source to reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving, avoiding the 4,000 chemicals found in cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Common Forms:** Gums, lozenges, and patches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   **Gums and Lozenges:** Available as 2 mg and 4 mg doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Patches:** Available as 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Patches are generally well-tolerated and easy to use, applied for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Gums can cause oral ulcers, jaw pain, or mouth soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Nicotine Gum Usage (Chew and Park Method):** This method is crucial and has been tested in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   Chew until a burning or tingling sensation occurs in the mouth, indicating rising nicotine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   Do not swallow the juice, as it reduces nicotine absorption (low bioavailability) and can cause gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, or retrosternal burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   Avoid hot beverages, water, or food for about 15-30 minutes after using the gum, as they can deactivate nicotine or reduce its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

#### Anti-Craving Medications for Nicotine

Two primary pharmacological agents are used:
*   **Varenicline:** The most effective medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. It acts as an alpha-4 beta-2 partial agonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Bupropion:** Increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels to reduce craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Caution is advised in patients with a history or risk of seizures, as it can decrease the seizure threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Opioid Poisoning

[[Common questions and themes in INICET exams | Opioid poisoning]] is a frequently tested topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Key Clinical Features:**
    *   Pinpoint pupils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   Respiratory depression or cyanosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
    *   Coma or unconsciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Treatment:** Intravenous (IV) Naloxone is the treatment of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. While Naltrexone is also an opioid antagonist, it is an oral medication and takes time to work, making it unsuitable for acute poisoning in unconscious patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Alcohol Withdrawal

[[Preparation strategy for INICET exam | Alcohol withdrawal]] is a critical condition often appearing in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

#### Timeline of Symptoms (1-2-3 Rule)

*   **Within 1 Day:** General withdrawal symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Within 2 Days:** Withdrawal-related seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Within 3-5 Days:** Delirium Tremens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

#### Detailed Symptom Progression

*   **Within the first 12 hours:**
    *   Tachycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
    *   Increased sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
    *   Insomnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
    *   Rebound REM phenomena (tested in exam), leading to nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Alcohol suppresses REM sleep, so cessation causes an increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
    *   Tremors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **Within 12 to 24 hours:**
    *   Perceptual problems, most commonly auditory hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
    *   **Alcoholic Hallucinosis:** Characterized by auditory hallucinations with a clear sensorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This distinction from delirium tremens is important and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Within 2 days:**
    *   Seizures: Typically generalized tonic-clonic seizures, often occurring in clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Within 3 days:**
    *   **Delirium Tremens (DTs):** An emergency condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
        *   Features altered sensorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
        *   Visual hallucinations are more common than auditory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
        *   **Lilliputian hallucinations:** A characteristic type of visual hallucination where objects (humans, birds, insects) appear small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This is a common stock question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

#### Classification of Withdrawal Symptoms

*   **Simple Withdrawal:** Includes symptoms like tachycardia, increased sweating, increased blood pressure, and insomnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Complex Withdrawal:** Occurs when patients experience psychotic symptoms, altered sensorium, or seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

#### Management of Alcohol Withdrawal

*   **Benzodiazepines:** The treatment of choice for managing [[anaesthesia_questions_in_inicet_nov_24 | alcohol withdrawal]], regardless of symptom complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **LOT Drugs for Liver Dysfunction:** In patients with liver dysfunction, Lorazepam, Oxazepam, and Temazepam (LOT) are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. These are short-acting and do not accumulate, reducing the risk of respiratory depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment: Aversive and Anti-Craving Drugs

#### Aversive Drug: Disulfiram

*   **Mechanism:** An irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. When alcohol is consumed, it leads to an increase in acetaldehyde levels, causing the "Disulfiram-ethanol reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Administration:** Can be started 12-24 hours after the last drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Precautions:**
    *   Liver function tests should be done before starting due to common liver involvement in alcohol patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
    *   Must only be given to motivated patients with their consent; never without their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
    *   Its effects can last for one to two weeks even after stopping the medication, due to irreversible inhibition of enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Patients must be cautioned about this residual effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
    *   Use with caution in patients with peripheral neuropathy and psychosis, as it can worsen these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Disulfiram-Ethanol Reaction Symptoms:** Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, flushing, and a garlic/onion-like odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

#### Anti-Craving Drugs (ANTSOB Acronym)

These drugs reduce the craving and urge to consume alcohol without reacting negatively with it, offering a safer alternative for patients not seeking complete abstinence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **A**camprosate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>
*   **N**altrexone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>
*   **T**opiramate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>
*   **S**SRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>
*   **O**ndansetron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>
*   **B**aclofen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>

Dr. Ravi, who secured Rank 3 in the INI CET exam and Rank 5 in NEET PG, shares his [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] for competitive medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of consistent effort, focused revision, and strategic use of resources.

## Mindset for Exams
Dr. Ravi's recent INI CET Rank 3 was "accidental" as he wasn't planning to give further exams after securing Rank 5 in NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His key takeaway from this success was the lack of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He approached the exam with an open mind, focusing only on attempting all 200 questions and giving his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

> "There was nothing on my mind... I was just like I have to attempt this 200 questions and give my best." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>

## Subject Preparation and Study Schedule
Dr. Ravi started his PG [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] from his third year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Third Year:** Focused on third-year subjects and parts of final-year subjects (e.g., 50% of surgery, medicine, OB/GYN, and some short subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This approach minimized the burden of final-year subjects during his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Final Year:** Became more serious, started MCQ practice alongside reading topics, and completed all final-year syllabus videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This was done to ensure he wouldn't need to watch videos during his internship due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Internship:** Utilized notes for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Note-Taking Strategy
Dr. Ravi used a mix of self-made notes (e.g., for surgery and medicine) and PDF notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. A crucial part of his [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | study and preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] was maintaining a "20th notebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To write down factual things or concepts he knew he would forget in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Common sense topics or easily remembered facts were excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** This condensed information (e.g., surgery notes fitting into 60 pages) allowed him to revise subjects very quickly (e.g., surgery in 8-9 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Alternative Hack:** For students who haven't created such a notebook early on, a quick hack is to click pictures of important points and store them in a private Telegram/WhatsApp group for quick review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## MCQ Practice
MCQ practice was a significant component of Dr. Ravi's [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | effective study strategies for medical exams]].
*   **Starting Point:** Most MCQ practice was done in the final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Internship Approach:** On day one of internship, he reset all completed modules on the app and started resolving them from scratch, including first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. By the end of his internship, he had completed about 80% of all MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Difference in Practice (Pre-Final/Final Year vs. Internship):**
    *   **Pre-Final/Final Year:** More time was spent reading full explanations and noting things down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Internship:** Less time for detailed explanations; instead, the time was used to revise from notes if an MCQ was answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. He was selective in reading explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Consistency:** Viewed MCQ practice as a daily challenge, aiming for a minimum of 4-5 modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Method for Practice:** Read a topic, then immediately solved the corresponding module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   Comprehensive review of the topic, understanding how MCQs can be formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
        *   "Hammers" the topic into the brain, preventing easy forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs) and Analysis
GTs are considered "irreplaceable" in [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | medical entrance exam preparation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Starting Point:** First GT was given in the first month of internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Varied from one GT every 2-3 weeks to sometimes two in a week during free postings, or only one a month during heavy postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **GT Analysis Strategy:**
    1.  Reviewed **incorrect questions** first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    2.  Then, reviewed **skipped questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    3.  Finally, reviewed questions that were **guessed but correct** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   The goal was to identify conceptual gaps or areas where understanding was weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This typically took 3-4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   Correct questions were only reviewed if there was extra time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Addressing Stagnant GT Scores:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Stagnant at 150 correct questions):** Realized he was postponing subjects like Community Medicine and FMT due to waiting for updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. He focused on these weak subjects (identified via subject-wise review in the app) to improve his scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (Stagnant at 165 correct questions):** Even after studying all 19 subjects, scores plateaued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. However, with more GTs and consistent review, his scores eventually rose above 170 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

[!TIP] Face your weak subjects early on in your [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]], rather than delaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This is crucial for improving GT scores and actual exam ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Revision Strategy
Revision is paramount in medical entrance exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** For NEET PG, Dr. Ravi did three to four revisions of the entire 19-subject syllabus in the last three months, taking only 20-25 days per revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Planning:** Revision should be planned from day one of [[dr_soumyadityas_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | Dr. Soumyaditya's preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It's impossible to read all main notes for 19 subjects a month before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Key:** Concise, self-made, or pre-made notes (like the "20th notebook") are essential for quick and efficient revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow App Features
*   **Dr. Rakesh Videos:** Dr. Ravi credits Dr. Rakesh's medicine videos for influencing him towards medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He appreciated the patient-oriented explanations and holistic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Pearls:** Marrow Pearls were extremely helpful during internship, especially during long duty hours in emergency or wards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. They served as a quick revision tool, focusing on important, highlighted concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **User Interface (UI):** Dr. Ravi praised the Marrow app's simple yet effective user interface, allowing easy access to videos and GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Advice for Future Aspirants
*   **Revision is Key:** The depth of study for one subject matters less than how many times you revise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Medicine is largely factual, requiring quick recall under exam stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Plan Revision Early:** Start planning your revision and making concise notes from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **GTs are Irreplaceable:** Giving Grand Tests is crucial for staying on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Foundation First:** Read the main subjects thoroughly before moving directly to revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

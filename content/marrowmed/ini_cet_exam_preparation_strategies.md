Dr. Jasurya, who secured Rank 5 in the May 2025 INICET exam, shares his [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet_exam | preparation strategy for the INICET exam]], highlighting his focused use of Marrow as his sole resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Originally from Hyderabad, he completed his MBBS at Gandhi Medical College, belonging to the 2018 batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This was his first attempt at a major medical entrance exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Journey and Resource Utilization

Dr. Jasurya's exposure to Marrow began in his third year of MBBS when he subscribed to a two-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He initially used Marrow lectures to grasp subjects and supplement his college studies for about one to one-and-a-half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

After a break during his internship to pursue plans in the UK that didn't materialize, he fully committed to INICET and NEET PG preparation around eight months before the exam, in September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Marrow Components Utilized:
*   **Main Notes**: These were his primary source of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. He used them to reinforce topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Question Bank (QBank)**: He solved relevant question bank modules immediately after reading notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. He completed approximately 80% of the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: He maintained a consistent habit of taking a Grand Test every 10 or 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Videos**: While he had a good base from watching videos in his third and fourth years, he couldn't cover all videos again due to time constraints during his focused 8-month preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He would revisit specific videos only for topics he couldn't grasp from the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Components Not Heavily Used:
*   **Custom Modules**: He used fewer than five custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos/Marathons**: He didn't have time for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | Preparation Strategy for INICET]]

Dr. Jasurya's [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | medical entrance exam preparation strategies]] revolved around integrating notes, question banks, and grand tests.

### Notes Strategy
*   He used Marrow's readymade notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   He *did not* add information from videos or the question bank directly into his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. He preferred keeping notes separate, viewing them solely for reading and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   He dislikes highlighting or writing in his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Question Bank (QBank) Approach
*   He engaged with the question bank *simultaneously* with reading notes, testing himself on what he had just read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   The QBank helped him understand how questions are framed, identify trick words, and apply knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   He used the QBank to *condense* his main notes by focusing on high-yield questions that were frequently repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   He revised by bookmarking all previous year questions (PQs) he got wrong, reviewing them twice before the INICET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Strategy
Grand Tests were considered the most high-yield component of his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Assessment**: He took a GT on his very first day of preparation to establish a baseline, scoring 118 correct out of 200 without any preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **First "Proper" GT**: His first serious GT was taken six months before the actual exam, by which time he had covered about 50% of the syllabus. He scored 136 correct questions and achieved a rank of around 300-400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Score Progression**:
    *   After his first revision, scores ranged from 150-155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
    *   During his second revision, scores rose to 155-170 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
    *   In the last five or six exams, scores consistently hovered between 165-175 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Rank Progression**: While his best GT rank was in the top 20, he consistently achieved ranks between 50 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. For the INI mock exam, he scored 166 questions correct and secured a rank of 228 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   **Reviewing GTs**:
    *   **Early Phase**: He would review 20 questions per day over 10 days (for a 200-question GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. He would thoroughly analyze even correct answers to ensure no guessing or gaps in knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Later Phase (Time Crunch)**: Towards the end of his preparation, he would review GTs on the same day they were given, focusing *only* on the questions he got wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Breaking Plateaus**: When hitting a plateau in scores, he would use Marrow's GT analytics to identify the five subjects he performed worst in. He would then intensively study those subjects over the next 10-15 days, which consistently resulted in a score increase of two to three questions in the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from Dr. Jasurya's Strategy

Dr. Jasurya's [[strategies_for_preparing_for_fmge_and_inicet_exams | strategies for preparing for FMGE and INICET exams]] echo common themes among toppers:
*   **Start Early**: Beginning preparation in the second or third year helps build a strong foundation and general knowledge, which is useful for both entrance and professional exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
*   **One Resource, Done Well**: Focus on one comprehensive resource and master it through multiple revisions, rather than superficially using multiple resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency with Grand Tests**: Regular and disciplined participation in GTs is crucial for objective measurement of preparation and identifying weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Treat GTs like the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Improvement**: Use GT analytics to pinpoint weak subjects and focus on improving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Stress Over Scores**: It's not a linear growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. Focus on the process and gradual improvement, rather than worrying too much about day-to-day scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.
*   **Stay Mentally Strong**: Don't be swayed by what others are doing; stick to what works for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

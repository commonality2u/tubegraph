Infections of the bone are a standard topic in orthopedic examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Chronic Osteomyelitis

Chronic osteomyelitis is characterized by specific clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
A patient, such as a 12-year-old boy, might present with leg pain and swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. On examination, the affected leg may be swollen and warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Laboratory Investigations
Typical laboratory findings include elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Radiological Findings
X-rays often show a sclerotic bone fragment surrounded by lucencies in the medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This appearance indicates a dense sclerotic bone, known as a sequestrum, surrounded by the absence of infection and new bone formation called an involucrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Causative Organisms
The most common cause of chronic osteomyelitis is *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Other organisms that can cause chronic osteomyelitis include *E. coli*, *Streptococcus*, and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. *Klebsiella* is considered an unlikely cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Specific patient populations may have different common causative organisms:
*   **Sickle cell disease patients:** *Salmonella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>
*   **IV drug abusers:** *Pseudomonas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>
*   **Osteomyelitis following animal bites:** *Pasteurella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>
*   **Osteomyelitis following human bites:** *Eikenella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>
*   **Osteomyelitis in patients undergoing prolonged parenteral therapy:** Fungal organisms, such as *Candida* and *Aspergillus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>

## Spinal Tuberculosis

For [[who_guidelines_on_diagnosing_spinal_tuberculosis | spinal tuberculosis]], the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends specific diagnostic investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Diagnostic Investigations
The gold standard investigation for diagnosing spinal tuberculosis is the culture of tissue collected from the infection site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This process typically involves identifying the lesion with an MRI of the spine, followed by a CT-guided biopsy of the tissue for culture and sensitivity testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. However, traditional culture methods are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, taking 2 to 6 weeks for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

For these reasons, the WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis (updated in 2024) recommend the use of Xpert MTB/RIF for detection in adults and children with signs and symptoms of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Xpert MTB/RIF is a gene expert test, which is a type of Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAT) or Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

This automated diagnostic test identifies *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DNA and can simultaneously detect resistance to Rifampicin, a crucial drug in tuberculosis treatment, in less than 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The rapid diagnosis provided by NAT/CBNAAT tests is why the WHO aggressively promotes their use for quick diagnosis of tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

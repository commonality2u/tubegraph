The gag reflex is a physiological response that involves the reflex contraction of pharyngeal and palatal muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This reflex is often tested by touching the posterior one-third of the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Nerves Involved

The gag reflex involves both afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) nerve pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Afferent Pathway
The afferent (sensory) fibers of the gag reflex are carried by the ninth cranial nerve, which is the glossopharyngeal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Efferent Pathway
The efferent (motor) fibers responsible for the reflex contraction of the constrictor and palatal muscles are carried by the tenth cranial nerve, the vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

In summary, the nerves involved in the gag reflex are the ninth (glossopharyngeal) and tenth (vagus) cranial nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils. The decision to perform a [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is based on specific infectious and non-infectious criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

## Infectious Indications

The most significant infectious indication for [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is recurrent episodes of tonsillitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Criteria for recurrent tonsillitis include:
*   More than three episodes per year for three consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   More than five episodes per year for two consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   More than seven episodes in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

## Non-Infectious Indications

The primary non-infectious indication for [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is when the tonsils are hugely enlarged, leading to obstructive symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. A common obstructive symptom is sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. This condition often corresponds to the [[tonsil_infections_and_their_types | parenchymatous variant]] of tonsillitis, where the tonsils become chronically enlarged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### Complications

One of the most common complications following [[techniques_and_complications_of_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is [[management_of_hemorrhage_following_tonsilectomy | hemorrhage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary fundus dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It is an autosomal recessive [[retinal_layers_and_anatomy | Rod dystrophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Patients typically present with gradual loss of vision at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This symptom, known as nyctalopia or night blindness, is a key indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The condition also leads to peripheral loss of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa is often made based on the characteristic symptoms and fundus examination findings.

### Key Findings
*   **Nyctalopia (Night Blindness)**: Patients report difficulty seeing in dim light or at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, which is directly related to the rod dystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Fundus Image**: Examination of the fundus typically reveals pigmentation in the periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Bony Spicule Pigmentation**: The most famous and characteristic finding is "bony spicule pigmentation" in the fundus periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis

The transcript mentions some other conditions that might be considered in a broader differential, though they do not fit the classic Retinitis Pigmentosa presentation:

*   **Retinitis Punctata Albescens**: This is a variant of Retinitis Pigmentosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Its onset is usually at birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The name "Punctata Albescens" indicates "dot-like" (Punctata) and "white" (Albescens) lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. These dot-like white lesions would be visible in the fundus, which were not present in the described case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Retinal Hemorrhage**: Hemorrhages are not associated with nyctalopia and are seen in conditions like [[diabetic_retinopathy_complications | diabetic retinopathy]] or hypertensive retinopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Fundus Flavimaculatus**: This is a variant of [[best_disease_and_its_diagnostic_investigation | Stargardt's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Stargardt's disease is a cone dystrophy, which would cause central loss of vision, not peripheral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The combination of nyctalopia and bony spicule pigmentation makes the diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

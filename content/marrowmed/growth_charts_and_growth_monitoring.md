Growth charts are fundamental tools used in pediatrics to monitor a child's physical development and identify potential [[patterns_of_growth_in_children | growth patterns]] or issues like growth failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## WHO Growth Charts

The World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts are standard tools for assessing a child's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. For instance, a weight-for-age chart for girls is typically depicted in pink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

### Normal Growth Trajectory
A normal growth trajectory on a WHO chart is generally considered to be:
*   Between 0 and +2 standard deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   Between 0 and -2 standard deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:97">[01:41:97]</a>.

### Growth Failure or Faltering
Growth failure or faltering is indicated when a child's growth value falls below -2 standard deviations on the chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. An example of growth faltering can be seen when a child's weight, initially following a normal trajectory, decreases in trend and falls below the -2 standard deviation line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>.

## Schmon's Growth Curve
Schmon's Growth Curve illustrates the distinct [[patterns_of_growth_in_children | growth patterns]] of various tissues and organs in the human body relative to age and percentage of adult size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:93">[05:41:93]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:99">[05:54:99]</a>. The x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents the percentage of adult size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Types of Growth Patterns:

*   **Curve A (Neural/Brain Growth)**
    *   Characterized by a parabolic curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:07">[06:10:07]</a>.
    *   Shows a steep initial increase, with approximately 90% of adult brain size attained by two years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:95">[06:21:95]</a>.

*   **Curve B (Lymphoid Tissue Growth)**
    *   Indicates that lymphoid tissues (such as tonsils, adenoids, and lymph nodes) grow to more than 100% of their adult size, typically between 4 to 8 years, before regressing back to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:21">[07:13:21]</a>.

*   **Curve C (Somatic/General Growth)**
    *   Presents as a sigmoid curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
    *   Shows an initial rapid increase during the first two years, followed by a slower increase, and then another rapid increase after approximately 12 years (representing the pubertal growth spurt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This curve typically reflects height increase patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

*   **Curve D (Gonadal Growth)**
    *   Remains relatively silent until 10 to 12 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:05">[07:54:05]</a>.
    *   After this age, there is a rapid increase in size, reflecting the development of gonads and secondary sexual characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

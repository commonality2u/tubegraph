## Treatment for Acute Mania
The primary treatment for acute mania involves the use of antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Antipsychotics are often considered the first-line treatment for acute mania due to their faster action and tolerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Both older and newer antipsychotics are effective, with second-generation antipsychotics commonly used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Other drugs that can be used in acute mania include carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Antidepressants like amitriptyline should **not** be used in patients with acute mania as they can worsen symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Maintenance and Prophylactic Treatment
For the maintenance or prophylactic treatment of mood episodes in bipolar patients, mood stabilizers are primarily considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The goal is to prevent further mood episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Mood stabilizers used for maintenance or prophylaxis include:
*   Lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
*   Valproate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
*   Carbamazepine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
*   Oxcarbazepine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

While these drugs are also used in acute mania, their primary role in this context shifts to preventing recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Specific Mood Stabilizers and Related Drugs

### Lithium
Lithium is most effective in patients with **typical, euphoric, or classical mania** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. These are patients who present with "textbook-like" descriptions of mania, often appearing very happy and engaging in activities like singing and dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Valproate
Valproate (valproic acid) is a mood stabilizer particularly useful in patients with:
*   **Atypical, irritable, or dysphoric mania** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>
*   Organic mood disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   Head injury-related mood changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>

> [!WARNING] Valproate is known to be teratogenic and can cause neural tube defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This is a crucial consideration in [[drug_management_in_obstetrics | drug management in obstetrics]].

### Lamotrigine
Lamotrigine is considered one of the safest mood stabilizers for use in pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. However, it is not highly effective in treating or preventing bipolar mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Its primary utility is in preventing bipolar depression symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Bupropion
Bupropion is an antidepressant that increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. It is notable for causing the least sexual side effects and least weight gain among antidepressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. It is also used in [[pharmacological_management_of_nicotine_addiction | pharmacological management of nicotine addiction]] and to treat ADHD, falling under the category of [[selective_nor_epinnephrine_reuptake_inhibitors_snris_and_adhd_treatment | Selective Nor Epinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. A key caution with bupropion is that it can decrease the seizure threshold, requiring careful administration in patients with a history of seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

### Ketamine
[[ketamine_as_a_rapidonset_antidepressant | Ketamine]] is a psychoactive drug and anesthetic agent that has gained importance for its rapid antidepressant effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. It is particularly useful in:
*   Treatment-resistant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>
*   Patients who are acutely suicidal, providing an immediate anti-suicidal action within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This allows time for other antidepressants, which typically take 2-3 weeks to show effect, to begin working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Ketamine is administered at a very small, sub-anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) as an IV infusion over 40 minutes in psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Cannabidiol (CBD)
Cannabidiol is primarily approved for treating resistant seizures, especially in children with conditions like Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Lesser known uses include chronic pain management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, neuromuscular spasms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, and improving appetite in cachexia related to HIV, cancer, or chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. It has also been explored for glaucoma, ADHD, anxiety, and substance use disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Cannabidiol is considered to have minimal or negligible abuse potential and is not known to be addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

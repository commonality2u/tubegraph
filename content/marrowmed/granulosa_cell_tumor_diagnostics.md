Granulosa cell tumors are a type of [[understanding_complex_cases_through_integrated_radiological_and_pathological_analysis | sex cord stromal tumor]] of the ovary, typically observed in elderly females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:38">[07:28:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:32">[08:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:14">[09:53:14]</a>. Grossly, these tumors often appear yellowish due to fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:04">[10:10:04]</a>.

## Diagnostic Features

### Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with an adnexal mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:03">[06:47:03]</a>. Given their estrogen-producing nature, granulosa cell tumors are associated with:
*   Endometrial hyperplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:22">[10:02:22]</a>
*   Endometrial cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:08">[10:04:08]</a>
*   Precocious puberty (in younger patients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:08">[10:04:08]</a>

### Microscopic Findings
Microscopy is crucial for diagnosis and often features distinct characteristics:
*   **Call-Exner Bodies**: These are a hallmark microscopic feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:32">[10:28:32]</a>. They appear as pinkish material surrounded by tumor cells, often forming circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:33">[07:47:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:27">[11:00:27]</a>.
*   **Nests of Tumor Cells**: The cells are arranged in nests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:33">[10:37:33]</a>.
*   **Coffee Bean Nuclei**: The nuclei of the tumor cells exhibit a nuclear longitudinal groove, resembling a coffee bean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. These can also be seen in other conditions like Brenner's tumors, papillary thyroid cancer, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and chondroblastoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

### Immunohistochemistry and Serum Markers
*   **Inhibin Positive**: Granulosa cell tumors stain positive for inhibin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:48">[09:10:48]</a>.
*   **CA 125 Levels**: Unlike surface epithelial tumors (e.g., serous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenomas), CA 125 levels are **not** typically raised in sex cord stromal tumors like granulosa cell tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

### Genetic Associations
*   **FOXL2 Gene Mutations**: Granulosa cell tumors are associated with FOXL2 gene mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.

### Differential Diagnosis
It's important to differentiate Call-Exner bodies from [[understanding_complex_cases_through_integrated_radiological_and_pathological_analysis | Schiller-Duval bodies]], which are seen in yolk sac tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

### Genetic Testing
[[Genetic testing in familial cancer cases | Genetic testing]] may be performed in cases with a strong family history of related cancers, although for granulosa cell tumors specifically, the FOXL2 mutation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.

Dr. Shreya Gandhi, who scored 244 in his first attempt at the FMG exam after completing his medical undergraduation in Russia, attributes his success significantly to his consistent and strategic [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | use of Marrow]] for his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Starting the [[Role of Marrow in exam preparation | Marrow]] Journey
Dr. Shreya subscribed to [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] towards the end of his third year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He continued to [[Utilizing educational apps like Marrow for medical studies | use Marrow]] consistently until his examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. His initial approach involved completing all the main video lectures, practicing the question banks, and doing a lot of custom modules, followed by numerous revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow Video Lectures]] Strategy
Initially, Dr. Shreya watched videos on subjects like Pathology and OBGYN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. He found that while [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow videos]] contained a lot of detailed content, solving questions helped him narrow down the most important and frequently asked points for the examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

His strategy for videos varied by subject:
*   **Major Subjects**: For extensive subjects like OBGYN, Surgery, Ophthalmology, and ENT, he completed the main, regular [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow videos]] end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Shorter Subjects**: For shorter subjects, where the number of questions in the exam is typically less (around 5 to 10 questions), he focused on the revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He found these revision videos to be "absolutely fantastic" and sufficient to achieve a 90% accuracy rate on questions from these subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He emphasized doing multiple revisions of these notes to remember every line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This approach allowed him to cover less content but be sure about what he had read, making it a "masterful strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

He specifically praised the Orthopedics faculty for summarizing the subject effectively in six to seven videos, finding the content sufficient for both the exam and Grand Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] Notes Strategy
Dr. Shreya chose to purchase the readymade printed notes provided by [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] rather than making his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. His approach to notes was:
*   **Initial Reading**: In his fourth and fifth years, when he had more time, he read all the notes cover-to-cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Marking Key Areas**: Later, realizing he wouldn't have time to read everything again, he started marking specific areas in the major notes that were frequently tested or required for questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Revision**: During revisions, he would navigate through his main notes, focusing on the marked important areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. He preferred sticking with his main notes, even for last-minute revisions, as he was confident he could cover them quickly due to repeated study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This helped with memory recall and provided a sense of completion and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | Utilization of Marrow Question Bank]]
Dr. Shreya followed a specific sequence: first, he watched the videos to understand a topic, then read the notes, and only then moved to the question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

*   **Initial Focus (NEET PG)**: Initially, until October-November 2024, he focused solely on the NEET PG and AIIMS question sections of [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Transition to FMG and Custom Modules**: Realizing he needed to prepare for FMG, he then shifted to the FMG section and primarily used custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He found custom modules efficient, using hashtags like #neat, #fmg, #clinical, and #mostcommons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Papers**: He repeatedly solved previous year papers, even if he knew the answers, to ensure reflexive recall and save time during the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Custom Module Strategy**: Initially, he used custom modules for single subjects to achieve 85-90% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Later, he started mixing multiple subjects and topics in his custom modules, which helped avoid subject bias and trained his mind for the random nature of questions in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Grand Tests and Analytics
Dr. Shreya began taking Grand Tests in September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. He believed it was essential to have a substantial amount of knowledge (at least 15-16 subjects completed) before appearing for Grand Tests to get a meaningful evaluation and avoid demotivation from low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

*   **Frequency**: He gave around five to six Grand Tests, initially once a month from September to December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Reviewing Analytics**: He diligently checked the Grand Test analytics provided by [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] to identify weak areas and silly mistakes, especially when he found himself getting tougher questions correct but making errors in easier ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. PSM was a subject he specifically worked on improving based on analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Review Strategy**: He prioritized reviewing wrong questions first, bookmarking important ones or making notes on a separate paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. He also briefly reviewed correct questions to confirm his reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Question Practice**: Despite giving fewer Grand Tests, Dr. Shreya emphasized that he practiced a huge number of questions (around 10,000-12,000) throughout the year, which was crucial for his confidence and familiarity with important subject areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He stressed that daily question practice has "no replacement whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Key Advice for Juniors
Dr. Shreya offered several key pieces of advice for juniors aspiring to clear the FMG exam:

*   **Start Early**: Begin preparation early, ideally not waiting until the last year or returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Use the Right Resources**: Select and stick to appropriate study materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Study**: Study with actual dedication, not just for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Regular Question Practice**: Solve questions regularly and don't be afraid of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Dedicate time every day, even if it's just an hour, to revise or solve questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Avoid skipping days unless feeling overwhelmed, in which case a day off in a week or ten days is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Study Partner**: Having a good study partner can be quite important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow as a Sole Resource]]
When asked about using shorter, more concise resources, Dr. Shreya strongly recommended [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]] as "sufficient enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. He advised students to "just trust the faculty, go through all the videos, the lectures, the notes, the questions they have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He stated that if one studies well from [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]], FMG is bound to happen, as people are even clearing INI CET using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. His key message was to "stick with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]], stay with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]], study everything in [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]], and just focus on [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

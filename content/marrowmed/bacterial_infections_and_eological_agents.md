## Sterilization and Disinfection Techniques

### Bacteriological Loops
*   Bacteriological loops, used for inoculating culture media, are typically sterilized by placing them in a flame until they become red hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   While autoclaving is a sterilization method, it is impractical for frequent, repeated sterilization of inoculation loops during culture work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   Loops are often made of expensive materials like platinum or nichrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Other Disinfection Methods
*   Passing slides and cover slips through a flame three times is a method for disinfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Bacterial Morphology and Staining

Different bacteria exhibit distinct morphologies and arrangements when viewed under a microscope, which aids in their identification.

### Gram-Positive Cocci
*   **_Streptococcus pyogenes_**: Appears as Gram-positive cocci in chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. It is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **_Staphylococcus_**: Arranged as Gram-positive cocci in clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **_Micrococcus_**: Appears as Gram-positive cocci in tetrads (sets of four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **_Enterococcus_**: Arranged in pairs, often at an angle to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Gram-Positive Rods
*   **_Nocardia_**:
    *   Causes infections following blunt trauma, especially in farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
    *   Microscopy of wound exudate shows weakly acid-fast beaded filamentous rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
    *   These appear as red-colored rods against a blue background in an acid-fast stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
    *   It belongs to the *Actinomycetales* family, which consists of Gram-positive, slender, branching rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
    *   _Nocardia_ is weakly or partially acid-fast, meaning it stains with a lower concentration of sulfuric acid (0.5-1%) as a decolorizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
    *   It is aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> and causes exogenously acquired infections, as it is a normal environmental saprophyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **_Actinomyces_**:
    *   Morphologically similar to _Nocardia_ on Gram stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
    *   Unlike _Nocardia_, it is not acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
    *   It is anaerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> and causes endogenous infections, as it is part of the normal flora in the oral cavity, GI tract, or female vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   **_Bacillus anthracis_**: A Gram-positive rod, but does not show slender morphology or branching, and is not acid-fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **_Listeria_**: A Gram-positive rod, but not acid-fast, not branching, and not filamentous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (MTB)**:
    *   Is acid-fast, typically with 20% sulfuric acid as a decolorizer, but does not have the filamentous morphology of _Nocardia_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
    *   The easiest culture medium for its isolation is Lowenstein-Jensen's (LJ) medium, an egg-containing green medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
    *   Malachite green in LJ medium acts as a selective agent, inhibiting unwanted bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
    *   Due to a long generation time (14-15 hours), MTB colonies form in 3-8 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
    *   Colony morphology is described as "rough, tough, and buff" (off-white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## [[Microbial phenomena and tests | Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing]]

### E-Test (Epsilometer Test)
*   A test used for antibiotic sensitivity testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   Involves placing plastic strips impregnated with a graded concentration of antibiotic onto a Mueller-Hinton agar plate inoculated with a bacterial lawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   After overnight incubation, ellipsoidal zones of inhibition are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   The point where the zone of inhibition intersects the strip indicates the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   Advantages: Determines the MIC (quantitative test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   Disadvantage: Expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion Test
*   More commonly used due to its lower cost and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   Uses discs impregnated with a single, standardized concentration of antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Zone of inhibition diameter is measured to determine if the bacterium is sensitive, intermediate sensitive, or resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   Disadvantage: Does not determine the exact MIC (qualitative test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

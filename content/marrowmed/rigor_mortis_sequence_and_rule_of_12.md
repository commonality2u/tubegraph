Rigor mortis is a postmortem stiffening of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The phenomenon is well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It begins approximately 60 minutes, or one hour, after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Mechanism

Rigor mortis occurs due to ATP depletion in the muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Sequence of Appearance (Nysten's Rule)

The process of rigor mortis follows a sequential manner and does not appear throughout the body simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Initially, after a person's death, there is primary flaccidity, followed by muscle stiffening (rigor mortis), and then secondary flaccidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Order of Muscle Involvement

*   Rigor mortis first begins in involuntary muscles, then progresses to voluntary muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   The first organ to show rigor mortis is the myocardium (heart muscle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   The first external site to show rigor mortis is the eyelid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Nysten's Order

The sequential order of rigor mortis appearance is known as Nysten's Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>:
1.  Heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
2.  Eyelid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
3.  Neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
4.  Jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
5.  Facial muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
6.  Thorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
7.  Upper limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
8.  Abdomen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
9.  Lower limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
10. Fingers and toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

This progression is from top to bottom, also described as proximo-distal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Rule of 12

The "Rule of 12" describes the timeline of rigor mortis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>:
*   **Appearance**: Rigor mortis starts and appears throughout the entire body within 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: It remains in the body for another 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Disappearance**: It then gradually disappears from the body in another 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The disappearance of rigor mortis also occurs in a descending order, similar to its appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Understanding the emergence points and anatomical relationships of [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves|cranial nerves]] from the brainstem is crucial for diagnosing and predicting the consequences of nerve injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Clinical questions often relate specific symptoms to the involvement of particular cranial nerves based on their location and function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Cranial Nerves on the Ventral Aspect of the Brain Stem

The ventral aspect of the brain stem is where many [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem|cranial nerves emerge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Identifying these nerves on the ventral aspect is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Third Cranial Nerve (Oculomotor Nerve)
*   **Emergence:** The third cranial nerve is the only nerve seen emerging from the interpeduncular fossa, which is located between the cerebral peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Clinical Implications of Injury:**
    *   Injury to the third nerve can lead to ipsilateral ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   It can also cause a divergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear Nerve)
*   **Emergence:** The fourth cranial nerve is unique as it is the only cranial nerve that emerges from the dorsal aspect of the brain stem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. It is also the thinnest cranial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   While the transcript describes its unique emergence, specific clinical implications of its injury are not detailed in this segment.

### Fifth Cranial Nerve (Trigeminal Nerve)
*   **Emergence:** The fifth nerve, a mixed nerve with sensory and motor components, is the only nerve emerging from the ventral surface of the Pons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Specific clinical implications of its injury are not detailed in this segment.

### Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Cranial Nerves
*   **Emergence:** These three cranial nerves (Abducens, Facial, and Vestibulocochlear) emerge together from the pontomedullary junction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Sixth Cranial Nerve (Abducens Nerve)
*   **Clinical Implications of Injury:**
    *   Injury to the sixth nerve can lead to a convergence squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   The sixth nucleus is located deep to the facial colliculus in the floor of the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   While the sixth nucleus is present, injury to the facial colliculus primarily affects the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery|facial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, not the sixth nerve directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Seventh Cranial Nerve (Facial Nerve)
*   **Anatomy:** The [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery|facial nerve]] makes an internal genu (bend) in the pons, forming an elevation called the facial colliculus on the floor of the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This bulge is formed because the facial nerve fibers surround the sixth (abducens) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Clinical Implications of Injury to Facial Colliculus:**
    *   If there's a tumor or pressure on the facial colliculus, the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery|facial nerve]] is primarily affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
    *   This leads to a [[physiology_of_lower_motor_neuron_lesions|lower motor neuron lesion]] of the facial nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   The muscles of facial expression supplied by the facial nerve will show paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Examples include zygomaticus major/minor, mentalis, risorius, and orbicularis oculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    *   It is less likely to primarily affect the lateral rectus muscle, which is supplied by the sixth nerve, in the context of facial colliculus injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Cranial Nerves
*   **Emergence:** These nerves (Glossopharyngeal, Vagus, and Accessory) emerge just lateral to the olive (inferior olivary nucleus) on the ventral aspect of the medulla oblongata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The spinal accessory nerve specifically comes from the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Specific clinical implications of their injury are not detailed in this segment.

### Twelfth Cranial Nerve (Hypoglossal Nerve)
*   **Emergence:** The hypoglossal nerve is the only nerve that emerges between the pyramid and the olive on the ventral aspect of the medulla oblongata, often as multiple rootlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Specific clinical implications of its injury are not detailed in this segment.

## Cranial Nerve Nuclei in the Floor of the Fourth Ventricle
The floor of the fourth ventricle, also known as the rhomboid fossa, exposes several cranial nerve nuclei on the dorsal aspect of the brain stem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

    *   **Facial Colliculus:** Contains the sixth (abducens) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Hypoglossal Triangle:** Deep to which the hypoglossal (twelfth) nucleus is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   **Vagal Triangle:** Contains the dorsal nucleus of Vagus (tenth nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Lateral to Sulcus Limitans (Sensory Area):**

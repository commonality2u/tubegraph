Consistency is a crucial element for success in demanding examinations like the NEET PG [00:09:53]. Vaibhav, who secured All India Rank one in NEET PG 2024, emphasized that maintaining consistent effort throughout the preparation period is vital [00:19:35].

## Strategies for Consistent Study
Vaibhav's approach to facing challenges, such as a hectic internship or unexpected incidents, was to "just keep going and just take it one day at a time" [00:00:27]. This mindset helps maintain balance during preparation, as every day is not the same [00:00:34].

### Sustaining Momentum on Challenging Days
On days when motivation might be low, the key is to still put in some effort [00:00:44]. Even solving a few questions or taking a mini-test can be productive, ensuring the day is not wasted [00:00:47]. This continuous, albeit sometimes minimal, effort helps maintain momentum throughout the preparation [00:20:02]. As long as the "ball is moving in the direction," success will eventually be reached [00:21:02]. Even doing one question a day is more beneficial than doing nothing [00:21:10].

## The Role of Practice Tests
[[the_impact_of_consistent_practice_tests_on_exam_performance | Consistent practice tests]] are a critical component of [[role_of_standard_and_thorough_preparation_for_exams | standard and thorough preparation]] for MCQ-based exams [00:03:29]. Vaibhav considered Grand Tests (GTs) his favorite learning tool [00:08:35]. He started giving GTs regularly from the beginning of his final year and continued this practice throughout his internship [00:03:19], [00:15:13]. Initially, he gave GTs every 15-20 days, gradually increasing the frequency to every 5-7 days in the last few months before the exam [00:15:22].

Regular Grand Tests help in:
*   Keeping up with MCQ-solving skills in a time-bound manner [00:08:55].
*   Simulating the actual examination environment, especially when practiced in a library setting with other students [00:07:17].
*   Learning to avoid distractions during the exam [00:07:23].
*   Boosting confidence, as seen when Vaibhav achieved a top 10 rank in a Marrow GT despite having night shifts [00:09:30]. This particular experience reinforced his belief that consistency, even during hectic periods, would be beneficial [00:09:53].

## Integrated Study Approach
Vaibhav's study strategy involved a mixed approach that emphasized deep understanding and continuous learning:
*   **Conceptual Learning** Vaibhav enjoyed using Marrow, putting "all his heart into it" to learn subjects conceptually [00:02:27].
*   **Question Banks** He started his [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | preparation]] by solving question banks to understand the pattern of questions asked in entrance exams [00:02:40].
*   **Video Lectures and Textbooks** His strategy involved watching video lectures, then referring to standard textbooks for related text, and finally solving question banks to reinforce concepts [00:04:45].
*   **Note-Making** He used a mixed approach for notes, including handwritten notes for subjects like surgery, pharmacology, pathology, and obstetrics/gynecology, and printed notes for others [00:05:05], [00:13:01]. He selectively added "highly catchy" or conceptual facts from question banks to his notes, avoiding making them bulky [00:13:41].
*   **Custom Modules** During internship free periods, he utilized Marrow's custom modules as quick mini-tests, allowing for immediate solving and review [00:16:25].

## The Importance of Starting Early
A common observation among successful toppers, including Vaibhav, is the [[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | importance of starting early]] in [[importance_of_exams_for_medical_students | medical exam preparation]] [00:19:01]. Starting early allows sufficient time to:
*   Finish regular videos for all subjects [00:18:50].
*   Complete question banks [00:18:53].
*   Dedicate enough time to Grand Tests and mock exams [00:18:54].
*   Build a broad and strong foundational understanding of concepts in the early years of MBBS [00:10:21]. This strong conceptual base is crucial as it allows retention for a longer period and provides an edge, especially in the last few months leading up to the exam when there isn't time to revisit textbooks or main notes [00:10:41].

## Mindset for Success
Vaibhav advises against attaching too much emotional significance to the exam, viewing it as a "transit from MBBS to post-graduation" rather than a "life or death" situation [00:18:02]. While it's essential to put "your heart into" the preparation and give your best, emotional detachment can prevent undue stress if results are not as expected [00:18:31]. The ability to enjoy the process of solving questions, rather than fearing tests, is also highlighted as an important aspect of preparation [00:20:32].

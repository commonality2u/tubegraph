[[Dimorphic fungi and their forms | Dimorphic fungi]] are characterized by their ability to exist in two distinct forms based on temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   At room temperature (25°C to 28°C), they appear in their **mold form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   At body temperature (37°C), they transform into their **yeast form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

Six key [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]] include:
*   *Histoplasma capsulatum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   *Blastomyces dermatitidis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>
*   *Coccidioides immitis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>
*   *Sporothrix schenckii* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>
*   *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

## Clinical Manifestations and Characteristics

### Coccidioides immitis
*   **Common Names**: Desert rheumatism, valley fever, San Joaquin Valley disease, or California disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Morphology**:
    *   Mold state: Shows barrel-shaped [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | arthrospores]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
    *   Yeast state: Seen as spherules filled with endospores at body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Blastomyces dermatitidis
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Can cause pneumonia with skin lesions, particularly in immunocompromised patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Morphology**:
    *   Yeast state: Characterized by broad-based budding yeasts, often described as having a "figure-of-eight" or "hourglass" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
    *   Mold state: Yields white colonies with hyphae and conidiospores on culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Histoplasma capsulatum
*   **Endemic Regions**: Endemic in Ohio and Mississippi River valleys in the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Common Names**: Ohio disease, Darling's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Can cause [[endemic_fungal_atypical_pneumonia | pneumonia]], fever, cough, breathlessness, and significant hilar mediastinal lymphadenopathy (mediastinitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   **Morphology**:
    *   Mold state: Shows tuberculate macroconidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
    *   Yeast state: Characterized by tiny budding yeasts seen inside macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

## Other Fungal Infections

### Myoma (Actinomycetoma)
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Typically presents with an ulcer on the feet with white powdery granules and multiple discharging sinuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
*   **Causative Agent**: Often caused by aerobic actinomycetes, particularly *Nocardia* species, which appear as gram-positive filamentous rods with branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis**: *Staphylococcus aureus* can cause a similar condition (botryomycosis) but would show gram-positive cocci, not filamentous rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### Candida
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Common cause of infections associated with central venous lines, leading to fever and tachycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **Morphology**:
    *   Colonies: Appear as buff (off-white), pasty colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
    *   Microscopy: Shows gram-positive, rounded yeast cells that reproduce by budding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

### Aspergillus
*   **Morphology**: A hyaline septate mold that does not have a yeast stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. It exhibits dichotomous branching at acute angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. Microscopic features include a conidiophore with a swollen vesicle and finger-like phialides bearing conidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Staining**: Best visualized in tissue sections using stains like Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

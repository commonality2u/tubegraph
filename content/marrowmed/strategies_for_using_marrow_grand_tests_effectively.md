[[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] grand tests and test series are widely recognized resources for medical exam preparation in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Many students endorse them as a platform to gauge their standing against competition, as the difficulty level of questions often mirrors that of actual exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Dr. Dian, who achieved Rank 4 in the May INI CET exam, leveraged grand tests extensively, considering them one of the most useful tools available on [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Dr. Dian's Approach to Grand Tests

Dr. Dian's strategy for using [[Marrow]] grand tests evolved throughout his preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Early Acclimatization

During his third year and the beginning of his final year, Dr. Dian adopted an early approach to grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. At this stage, his primary goal was not to achieve high scores, but rather to:
*   Become familiar with the format of the grand test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Acclimatize to answering 200 questions in a timed setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Test and refine his guessing abilities, practicing making intuitive and educated guesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He acknowledged that he wasn't fully ready with all subjects at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Regularity and Live Participation

As he progressed into his internship, Dr. Dian began taking grand tests more regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. A key aspect of his strategy was to:
*   Always take the grand test when it was live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   This ensured an accurate All India Rank, which was crucial for gauging his preparation level effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. He noted that the rank would not be as accurate if the test was taken after the live period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Correlation with Success

Dr. Dian's experience highlights the predictive power of [[Marrow]]'s grand tests. His best rank in a grand test was four, which coincidentally matched his final rank in the INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This correlation is attributed to the careful design of the grand and mock tests, which are based on historical exam patterns and aim to mimic future exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The rigorous process of ensuring accuracy and relevance in the question bank, including controversial topics, contributes to this reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Effective [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | exam preparation]] hinges on a well-structured timeline, especially for high-stakes medical entrance exams like NEET PG and INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This guide outlines a recommended timeline and strategies to maximize performance.

## Predicted Exam Dates

The National Board of Examination released a tentative schedule for various exams, but the most important one, NEET PG 2025, was not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. While predictions are difficult, it's advisable to prepare with **early April 2025** in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Any time beyond that should be considered bonus for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

INI CET is generally more predictable in its scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, with the next one expected in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

## Importance of Early Preparation

[[starting_early_with_pg_exam_preparation | Starting early]] and maintaining consistency are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
[[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | The importance of starting early]] allows for multiple revisions, which is key to securing a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. Two solid revisions are recommended by March end or early April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on your "circle of control" (how many questions you solve, your planning) rather than the "circle of concern" (exam date, difficulty), which is not under your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>.

## Marrow's Edition 8 and Revision Strategy

Marrow's Edition 8 (replacing Edition 6.5) offers updated content in a more crisp and palatable manner, primarily focused on INI CET, NEET PG, and FMG exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. It is less verbose and more exam-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

### Edition 8 Revision Videos
These videos comprise 200+ hours of updated content, designed to be concise for efficient learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Conciseness:** For instance, Medicine in Edition 8 has 125 hours of core content, making it realistically completable even if starting late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Mind Maps:** OBGY revision videos include 40-50+ mind maps to help condense material from 8-10 pages to one or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **PYQ Integration:** Important previous year questions (PYQs) are included directly within the revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Notes:** Soft copy notes are live in the app, and PDFs will be sent to registered email IDs by the second week of December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### When to Use Revision vs. Main Videos
For those starting fresh with the Edition 8 revision videos, if you consistently score **more than 70-75% correct** in the QBank modules after watching them, you can stick to revision videos for that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. However, if your performance dips below 60-65%, it indicates a problem in understanding, and you should use the main video lectures to solidify concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Just doing revision videos once is not enough; they need to be reviewed multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. They also need to be combined with the QBank to be complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

## Effective Revision Techniques

The "funnel approach" to revision aims to cut down revision time by half with each subsequent pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

1.  **First Read/Viewing:** Focus on getting more information into your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. Utilize main videos for conceptual topics where needed.
2.  **Subsequent Revisions:**
    *   **Underlining Pattern:** Use a uniform pattern for underlining notes (e.g., orange for keywords, yellow for concepts, green for investigations of choice) for visual recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
    *   **20th Notebook/Digital Group:** Create a customized "20th notebook" (or a WhatsApp group for personal notes) with facts you struggle to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. This should be unique to your weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. Revise this regularly, deleting facts you've now memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Bookmarked MCQs & Custom Modules:** Regularly review bookmarked MCQs. Create custom modules from bookmarked questions to revise weak topics efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.

## Leveraging Practice and Analysis

### Question Bank (QBank)
The QBank is a critical learning tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize PYQs:** If short on time, start with previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Prioritize High-Yield Topics:** Within the QBank, prioritize modules based on frequently asked topics (PYTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules:** Use tags in custom modules to focus on specific question types like "drug of choice," "investigation of choice," "image-based," or "clinical problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **Magic Modules:** These are a new feature where the app generates high-yield MCQs from your past mistakes, serving as a great tool for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. They unlock as you solve more questions and make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Take Grand Tests regularly (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly) and review them on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Review Strategy:** Focus on reviewing incorrect answers and those you guessed correctly (using the guess tracker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. Don't waste time reviewing questions you got correct and were sure about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Categorize Mistakes:**
    *   **Silly Mistakes:** (e.g., missing "except" or "false") will reduce with more practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.
    *   **Concept-Based Mistakes:** Go back to the main videos to understand the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
    *   **Factual Mistakes:** Add these specific facts/tables to your 20th notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

### Pearls
Pearls are concise tables and facts, often with mapped PYQs, excellent for quick revision during idle time or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. They are accessible even without a Marrow subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

## Advice for Different Student Groups

### Overall Timeline Recommendation
Aim to finish all subjects (first reading/watching) by **end January +/- 15 days** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. This allows for:
*   First revision: 45 days, until mid-March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   Second revision: From mid-March until mid-April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

### For Those Awaiting Counseling
If you're waiting for further counseling rounds (e.g., third or stray rounds for previous NEET PG), **stay in touch with studies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Solve questions or revise notes to avoid being caught off guard if results don't go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Consider appearing for INI CET, as it is more predictable and a good practice exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### For Freshers
The current exam pattern (more clinical, integrated, and image-based) is easier for freshers compared to those relying on rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. [[integration_and_time_management_in_medical_exams | Integration and time management]] are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### For Those Starting Preparation Now
Adhere to the timeline above. With 200 hours of revision videos, dedicating 4 hours daily for videos and 2 hours for QBank means you can finish in about 50 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### For Those Who Have Completed 7-8 Subjects
You are in a good position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. Start appearing for GTs to identify weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Address weak subjects now rather than delaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Consider mixing one weak subject with one strong subject to maintain interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

### For Working Professionals
The recommended schedule (e.g., 5.5 hours daily for videos and MCQs) is doable even while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

### For Interns
*   Revise final year subjects you are fresh with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.
*   Approach the QBank for those subjects.
*   Revisit first and second-year subjects one by one, alternating with clinical subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>.
*   Aim to complete all subjects with the QBank by mid-internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>.
*   One strategy is to prepare a custom module of PYTs in the morning for the topic you plan to study later, and solve MCQs during internship, then revise the topic from notes/videos at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

## Key Principles for Success

*   **Consistency:** It takes 36-38 days for a habit to form, so solve questions regularly to build a reflex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | Consistency]] is the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Focus on Basics and Concepts:** The exam increasingly emphasizes basic concepts and integrated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. Don't just memorize; understand the core ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Clinical Orientation and Image-Based Questions:** Focus on keywords and images in clinical vignettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_standard_and_thorough_preparation_for_exams | Standard and thorough preparation]] for Exams:** The exam checks your "grounding" and ability to quickly identify the core of a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Competitive Mindset:** This is a competitive exam; aim to score above others by devising [[dr_hamzas_exam_preparation_strategy | strategies]] and developing an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.
*   **Smart Work:** This means working hard with a proper plan and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Procrastination:** Start with small, achievable goals, or subjects you enjoy, to build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.
*   **Belief in Yourself:** You are capable of clearing the exam and achieving a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>.

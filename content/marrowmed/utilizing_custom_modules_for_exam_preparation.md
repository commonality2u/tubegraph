Utilizing custom modules can be a highly effective strategy for [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | exam preparation]], especially in the months leading up to a competitive medical exam like the FMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach helps maintain connection with all subjects and simulate exam conditions.

## Usage Strategy

Dr. Mayank, who scored 252 in the FMG exam, found [[Utilizing custom modules for exam readiness | custom modules]] to be very beneficial, particularly during the last six months of his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. His strategy involved:
*   **Late-stage adoption**: He started using [[custom_module_and_gt_analysis_for_exam_preparation | custom modules]] in the final six months of his study period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Daily practice**: He committed to doing 100 to 100 questions daily from the [[Utilizing digital tools and Q banks for exam preparation | custom module]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive subject coverage**: The questions he added to his [[utilizing_test_resources_like_marrows_custom_module_for_medical_exams | custom module]] covered all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Consistent tagging**: He consistently used specific tags like "clinical NEET PG" and "ICT" for his questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Benefits of Custom Modules

The main advantages of [[utilizing_grand_tests_and_custom_modules_for_exam_readiness | custom modules]] include:
*   **Maintaining subject connectivity**: By doing questions from all subjects daily, one can remain connected with all 19 subjects simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This prevents forgetting other subjects while focusing on one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Repeated revision**: This approach facilitates continuous and repeated revision of all topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Custom Modules vs. Subject-Specific Question Banks

A significant benefit of [[Using question banks and practice modules | custom modules]] over traditional subject-specific [[Utilizing Question Banks for Competitive Medical Exams | question banks]] is the elimination of bias:
*   When studying a specific subject, a bias is formed, leading you to expect and seek answers within that subject's topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   With a randomized [[custom_module_and_gt_analysis_for_exam_preparation | custom module]] covering multiple subjects, you don't know the origin of the question, which tests your ability to find the answer in an actual exam scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This is considered more powerful than just completing a subject-specific [[Utilizing digital tools and Q banks for exam preparation | question bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

> "When you do a custom module and randomize it and put multiple subjects in it, then you will not know from where did this question come, then you will be Testing your ability to find the answer in the exam scenario and I think that is more powerful compared to just doing the question bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Although marathons were offered to motivate students to engage with [[Utilizing digital tools and Q banks for exam preparation | question banks]] and [[utilizing_test_resources_like_marrows_custom_module_for_medical_exams | custom modules]], Dr. Mayank's consistent daily practice meant he didn't need to participate in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He was running his "own marathon" from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Dr. Somya Aditya, who secured an INIC rank of 2, shared insights into how he managed to balance his rigorous medical studies with the demanding responsibilities of an internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.

## Dr. Somya's Approach to [[balancing_internship_and_exam_preparation | Internship and Exam Preparation]]

Dr. Somya outlined a comprehensive strategy for integrating study into a busy internship schedule:

*   **Early Preparation** He subscribed to Marrow and started watching videos from his third year, completing significant portions of final-year subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Gynae, and OBS before entering his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Completing Core Subjects** By the mid-point of his internship, he had completed revisiting his first and second-year subjects, utilizing main videos for selective topics and relying on revision notes and QBank for the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.
*   **Revision Cycles** During his internship, he completed two to three cycles of main subjects and about two cycles for shorter subjects by consistently revising his main video notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of QBank and PYQs** He completed the entire QBank before his May exam and revised it multiple times, particularly focusing on mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. He also heavily utilized previous year questions (PYQs) from the QBank, revisiting them about two to three weeks before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.
*   **Incorporating GTS** He started taking Grand Tests (GTS) from his mid-internship after completing one full revision cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>, prioritizing taking them live to avoid accumulating liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. He adjusted his study focus based on GT scores, dedicating more time to weaker subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

## Daily Schedule During Internship

When asked how he coped with the hectic nature of internship, Dr. Somya detailed his daily routine:
> "I went to college, I did all my duties then when I returned home and then that small time which I got before sleep I devoted that time to studying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.

He noted that certain department postings, particularly those with "light" or "short subjects," offered more free time for study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. He thoroughly utilized this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

### Connecting Theory with Practice
A significant advantage during internship was the ability to directly relate theoretical knowledge from his notes to practical experiences in the wards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.

## Importance of Clinical Experience

The interviewer, Dr. Sakshi Aur Hans, emphasized that attending internship and gaining experience from the wards is "extremely extremely important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>. She stressed that no video can substitute the clinical knowledge acquired by observing patients and participating in ward rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

> "If you are an undergraduate student please don't miss out on the clinical rounds and if you are an intern don't even think about about this that you are not going to get a rank because you are doing your internship you are getting less time rather you are getting much more experience than any student who's sitting at home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

This highlights that while internships are demanding, they provide invaluable practical experience that contributes directly to exam success, especially as many questions are derived from ward experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

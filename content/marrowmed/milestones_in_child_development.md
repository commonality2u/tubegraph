[[developmental_milestones_in_pediatrics | Developmental milestones]] are important topics within pediatrics, frequently appearing in examinations like the INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Questions often focus on specific attainments at particular ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Four-Year-Old Milestones

A common scenario in [[pediatrics_recall_questions_ini_cet_may_2025 | recall questions]] involves identifying the probable age of a child based on a set of developmental achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For instance, a child able to copy a cross, tell stories, and go to the toilet alone typically fits the age of four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Based on the Nelson textbook of Pediatrics, key milestones attained at four years include:

### Motor Domain
*   Hopping on one foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Able to go downstairs with one foot per step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Fine Motor Domain
*   Imitates construction of a gate of five cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Able to copy a cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Language Domain
*   Able to count four pennies accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Able to tell a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Social Domain
*   Able to play interactively with other children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Engages in role play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Able to go to the toilet alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

These milestones collectively indicate the typical [[developmental_milestones_in_pediatrics | developmental stage]] of a four-year-old child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Related Concepts Mentioned in Pediatrics
*   **Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)**: Diagnostic criteria for SAM in children aged 6 months to 5 years include mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 11.5 cm, presence of bipedal edema, and [[growth_charts_and_growth_monitoring | weight for height]] less than or below minus three standard deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Low [[patterns_of_growth_in_children | height for age]] is indicative of chronic malnutrition, not acute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Factor 13 Deficiency**: A rare, autosomal recessive clotting factor disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Bleeding manifestations, such as epistaxis, recurrent rectal bleeding, and umbilical bleeding since birth, are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Basic coagulation tests (PT, APTT, platelet count and function) are typically normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> because Factor 13 acts after clot formation to stabilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The diagnostic test is the Urea Clot Solubility Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Primary Failure of SAM Treatment**: Criteria include failure to regain appetite by day 4, failure to start losing edema by day 4, complete absence of edema not achieved by day 10, or not gaining more than 5 grams per kg per day by day 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Breast Milk Jaundice**: A benign condition in exclusively breastfed babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. It is characterized by total serum bilirubin exceeding 10 mg/dL after 3 to 4 weeks of birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. It is due to substances like beta-glucuronidase in breast milk that deconjugate bilirubin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Breastfeeding is seldom stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Cystic Fibrosis**: Often features bilateral nasal polyps, meconium ileus (delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Bleeding diathesis can occur due to pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including Vitamin K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **[[congenital_diseases_and_their_diagnostics_in_pediatrics | Congenital Heart Disease]] (Nadas Criteria)**: Major criteria include systolic murmur of grade 3 or more, any diastolic murmur, cyanosis (central), and congestive cardiac failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Minor criteria include holosystolic murmur less than grade 3, abnormal S2, abnormal ECG, abnormal chest X-ray, and abnormal blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The diagnosis is indicated by one major criterion or two minor criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Increased Troponin T is not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS)**: A post-infectious polyneuropathy often preceded by *Campylobacter jejuni* infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Characterized by ascending paralysis or weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a> and absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. CSF analysis shows albuminocytological dissociation (high CSF protein with normal cell count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Treatment for progressive weakness includes IV immunoglobulin (first line) and plasma exchange (for refractory cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Steroids are not effective for improving weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.
*   **Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)**: An upper respiratory infection typically affecting children aged 6 months to 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. It is primarily a viral infection, most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, followed by influenza virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Clinical features include low-grade fever, stridor, and a characteristic "barking cough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. X-rays may show a "steeple sign" due to subglottic narrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Ductus Arteriosus Closure**: The primary factor for its closure after birth is the increase in oxygen levels due to breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This rise in oxygen causes constriction of the smooth muscles in the ductus arteriosus wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. A secondary factor is the decrease in prostaglandin levels, which maintain its patency during fetal circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)**:
    *   Chest compression rate: approximately 100 to 120 per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
    *   Compression depth: at least 1/3 of the AP diameter of the child's chest (approx. 4 cm in infants, 5 cm in children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
    *   Allow full chest recoil after each compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
    *   Compression-to-ventilation ratio: 30:2 for a single rescuer, 15:2 for two rescuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
    *   Adrenaline: Dose is 0.01 mg/kg IV or IO, using a 1:10,000 concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Maximum dose is 1 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Endotracheal (ET) route is an alternative if IV/IO access is not available, but is least preferred due to erratic absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
    *   Adenosine is not used in pediatric CPR; it's for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

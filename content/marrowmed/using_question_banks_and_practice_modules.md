Dr. Rajeswari, an FMG exam topper, emphasized the strategic use of question banks and practice modules in her preparation. She utilized these tools to solidify concepts, identify weak areas, and build confidence.

## Integrating Question Banks with Video Lectures

Dr. Rajeswari's primary approach involved integrating question bank modules directly with her video lecture study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>.
After watching four to five video modules a day, which typically amounted to three and a half to four hours of content, she would immediately proceed to solve the corresponding question bank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. This immediate application helped her better understand the concepts and facilitated revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>.

She aimed to complete almost all topics in the question bank, opting to address more challenging questions later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:31">[05:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:54">[05:27:54]</a>. Her target score in the question bank was approximately 80%, a feat she found achievable after thorough video study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:41">[05:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:26">[05:41:26]</a>. Any new information encountered in the question bank was promptly added to her self-prepared notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:39">[02:51:39]</a>.

Even when utilizing revision videos, she would tackle modules again and incorporate any missed points into her notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>. For concepts not fully grasped during revision, she would refer back to the more detailed regular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:15">[04:04:15]</a>. The ultimate goal, she noted, was to master the concept, regardless of the source (regular videos, revision videos, or question bank), to be prepared for any exam question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>.

## [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | Utilizing Custom Modules]]

Custom modules proved to be a critical component of Dr. Rajeswari's preparation, particularly in the final three to four months leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:17">[08:46:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:29">[08:48:29]</a>. During this period, she dedicated herself to solving approximately 200 questions daily, typically completing four custom modules, each containing 50 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:11">[08:30:11]</a>.

Custom modules provided random questions from across all subjects, serving as a comprehensive test of her knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:04">[08:56:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>. Consistently scoring well (e.g., 40-42 out of 50) in these modules boosted her confidence, reaffirming her grasp of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:43">[08:52:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:30">[09:13:30]</a>. She stressed the importance of practicing 100 to 200 questions daily, especially towards the end of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:31">[09:25:31]</a>.

### Advice for Juniors

Dr. Rajeswari advises her juniors to:
*   Watch videos and immediately follow up with the corresponding modules to clarify doubts and understand mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:03">[09:51:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   Utilize [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | custom modules]], even if not all 19 subjects have been completed. Focus on completed subjects to gain correlation and integrated understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:44">[10:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:06">[10:11:06]</a>.

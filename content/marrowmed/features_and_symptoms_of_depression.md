Depression is characterized by a range of symptoms and features, with specific diagnostic criteria outlined in classifications like ICD-10 and DSM-5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Cardinal Features

As per ICD-10, the cardinal or core features of depression include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>:
*   Reduced interest in pleasurable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   Low mood most of the day and at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   Reduced energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>

These three core features can be remembered with the acronym "EMI problem": Energy low, Mood low, Interest levels low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] ICD-11 and DSM-5
> Current diagnostic classifications (ICD-11 and DSM-5) typically focus on two cardinal features: low mood and low interest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Low energy levels are no longer primarily discussed as a core feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. For a depression diagnosis, at least one of these two (low mood or low interest) must be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Common Symptoms

A comprehensive list of symptoms can be remembered using the acronym "DIGESCAPS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>:
*   **D**epressed mood or affect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>
*   **I**nterest levels low (also known as [[anhedonia]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>
    *   [[anhedonia | Anhedonia]] is the loss of pleasure from previously pleasurable activities; things one used to enjoy, they no longer do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **G**uilty feelings (excessively or pathologically) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
*   **E**nergy low, leading to easy fatigue or excessive tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>
*   **S**leep problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>
*   **C**oncentration problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>
*   **A**ppetite problems (changes, often loss of appetite and significant weight loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>
*   **P**sychomotor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   **S**uicidal behaviors or thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>

> [!CAUTION] Lack of Self-Esteem and Confidence
> While patients with depression can exhibit a lack of self-esteem or poor confidence, this is not considered a core or cardinal feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Diagnostic Criteria

For a diagnosis of depression, at least five out of these nine symptoms should be present for a minimum duration of two weeks or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Importantly, among these five, either low mood or low interest must be one of the important features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

Beyond the presence of symptoms, current diagnostic approaches (ICD-11 and DSM-5) also consider whether these symptoms are causing a decrease in the patient's functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. A significant impairment in personal, family, social, academic, or occupational roles and responsibilities indicates a disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Parasitic Diseases

### Helminthic Infections

Auto-infection is a phenomenon observed in several helminthic parasites. This includes _Taenia solium_, _Hymenolepis nana_, _Enterobius vermicularis_, and _Strongyloides_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Among these, _Strongyloides_ is the most common cause of auto-infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Additionally, the protozoan _Cryptosporidium_ can also cause auto-infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Protozoal Infections

#### Morphological Forms of Protozoa
Protozoa can exhibit different morphological forms:
*   **Intestinal Protozoa** are typically found with two morphological forms: trophozoite and cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Both forms can be seen in stool samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. An example is _Giardia_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Free-living Protozoa** also have two forms: trophozoite and cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Trophozoites are seen in CSF samples, while cysts are present in the brain but not in CSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Examples include _Naegleria_ and _Acanthamoeba_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Vaginal Protozoa** possess only one morphological form, the trophozoite, with cysts being absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. _Trichomonas vaginalis_ is an example of a vaginal protozoan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

#### Toxoplasmosis (_Toxoplasma gondii_)
_Toxoplasma gondii_ infection is more common in the third trimester of pregnancy, impacting mother-to-baby transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

*   **Hosts**:
    *   **Definitive host**: Cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
    *   **Intermediate hosts**: Mammals (e.g., humans, sheep, cattle, cow, goat) and birds (e.g., hen, duck, pigeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Infective Stage**: Oocysts shed in cat feces are not immediately infective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. They must undergo sporulation in the soil to become infective, leading to the formation of sporozoites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Culture**: _Toxoplasma_ is non-cultivable in standard laboratory media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It can be cultured via viral culture methods such as animal inoculation (preferred animal is mice, specifically in the peritoneal cavity) or vero cell culture (tissue culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

#### Malaria
Malaria treatment involves different drugs for clinical cure, radical cure, and transmission cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

*   **_Plasmodium vivax_ Malaria**:
    *   **Clinical Cure**: Achieved by Chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Chloroquine also kills gametocytes, contributing to transmission cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
    *   **Radical Cure** (preventing relapse): Achieved by Primaquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Primaquine can also kill gametocytes, aiding transmission cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **_Plasmodium falciparum_ Malaria**:
    *   **Clinical Cure**: Achieved by drugs like Artesunate, Pyrimethamine, and Sulfadoxine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
    *   **Transmission Cure**: Achieved by Primaquine, which kills gametocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
    *   There is no need for radical cure in _P. falciparum_ malaria as there is no relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   Primaquine is specifically involved in radical cure and transmission cure, not in clinical cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

#### Leishmaniasis
Amastigotes surrounded by macrophages are a characteristic finding in Leishmaniasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. Leishmaniasis can affect the skin and cause hepatosplenomegaly, but not the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>.

### Enterobiasis (_Enterobius vermicularis_)
Infections with _Enterobius vermicularis_ typically manifest with perianal itching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Diagnosis is commonly made using the cellophane tape (NIH perianal swab) test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The eggs are plano-convex (one side flat, one side convex) and D-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Viral Diseases

### Herpes Virus Infections
*   Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1, 2, and 3 cause skin manifestations characterized by vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
    *   HSV-1 typically causes vesicles on the upper body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   HSV-2 typically causes vesicles on the lower body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
    *   HSV-3 (Varicella-Zoster Virus) causes vesicles over the entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   Diagnosis can be aided by a Tzanck smear, which reveals multinucleated giant cells, also known as Tzanck cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.
*   Treatment for herpes infections is Acyclovir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

### Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
*   HPV serotypes 6 and 11 are responsible for anogenital warts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   HPV serotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 can cause cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
*   Serotypes 16 and 18 are the most common strains responsible for cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Enteroviruses
*   Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis can be caused by Coxsackie A24 serotype and Enterovirus 70 serotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are characteristic of cytomegalovirus infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

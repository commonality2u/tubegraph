Dr. Sayani, who secured an All India Rank 5 in the INI-CET November exam on her first attempt, shares her strategies for effective exam preparation, emphasizing the crucial role of [[using_question_banks_and_practice_modules | question banks]] and [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | mock exams]] (Grand Tests). She began her preparation with Marrow in her second year of MBBS, during the pandemic in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a>.

## Dr. Sayani's Approach to Question Banks

Dr. Sayani diligently used Marrow's [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]] as a core part of her study routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.

*   **Initial Engagement:** When she started solving the [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]], she was not concerned about her scores, focusing instead on going through the questions once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:49">[06:21:49]</a>. She even reset the [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]] once to review it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:46">[06:30:46]</a>.
*   **Integrating New Information:** After watching subject videos, she would complete the corresponding [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]] module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>. Any new information or questions not covered in the videos were added directly to her notes, making them a comprehensive source for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:10">[05:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:33">[05:15:33]</a>.
*   **Tricky Questions:** The Marrow [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]] and [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Marrow GTs]] were particularly helpful in answering tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:40">[06:41:40]</a>, as the questions are intentionally designed to stimulate critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Mock Exams (Grand Tests)

Dr. Sayani recognized the significance of [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | mock exams]] in her preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a>.

*   **Consistent Participation:** She took all available [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | mock exams]], including the INI-CET mocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:30">[07:00:30]</a>.
*   **Performance in Mocks:** In the final INI-CET mock before her November exam, she secured a rank of 33, indicating she was consistently among the top performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:56">[07:09:56]</a>. This gave her an idea of her true standing among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:15">[07:22:15]</a>.
*   **Grand Test Analysis Strategy:** Dr. Sayani developed a disciplined approach to reviewing [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | grand tests]]:
    *   **Immediate Review:** She analyzed her [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | grand test]] results on the same day they were released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. This immediate review kept the questions and mistakes fresh in her mind, preventing the "freshness" from fading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:06">[12:07:06]</a>.
    *   **Prioritized Review:** She started by reviewing all the questions she got wrong, then moved on to unattempted questions, and finally glanced through the correct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:47">[11:09:47]</a>.
    *   **Understanding Correct Answers:** Even for correct answers, she briefly reviewed them, especially if she had guessed, to understand the correct explanation and rule out luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:15">[11:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Time Commitment:** She aimed to complete the entire review within one day, or at most one and a half days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:48">[11:57:48]</a>.

> "If you keep a [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | grand test]] review for later, it won't be done anytime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:03">[11:01:03]</a>

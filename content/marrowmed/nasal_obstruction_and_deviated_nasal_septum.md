Nasal obstruction can be caused by a [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | deviated nasal septum (DNS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This condition may present with symptoms such as headaches and sleep disturbances due to snoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Diagnosis
Examination of a [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | deviated nasal septum]] may reveal a prominent C-shaped deformity on one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Treatment: Corrective Surgery
Corrective surgery for a [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | deviated nasal septum]] can involve either [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | septoplasty]] or [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | SMR]] (Submucous Resection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Patient Considerations
Typically, septal surgeries are not performed on children younger than 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This is due to the presence of secondary centers of ossification, which if damaged, could lead to additional deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, surgery may be considered in children if there are significant issues such as sleep disturbances due to nasal obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Septoplasty vs. SMR
*   **[[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | Septoplasty]]**: This is a more conservative surgical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   **Incision**: An incision is made at the lower border of the septal cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Procedure**: The mucosal and perichondral flap is raised on one side, and only the deviated portion of the septum is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The surgery aims to preserve healthy tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   **Incision Name**: The incision used in [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | septoplasty]] is known as Friar's Incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This can be remembered as making the septum "freer" from deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **[[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | SMR]] (Submucous Resection)**: This procedure is less conservative than [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | septoplasty]], and complications are higher following SMR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Incision**: The incision is given 1 cm above the lower border of the septal cartilages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Procedure**: A significant portion of the septum is removed, leaving behind an L-shaped strut of cartilage superiorly and inferiorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   **Incision Name**: The incision for [[septoplasty_and_smr_procedures | SMR]] is called Killian's Incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This can be remembered as "killing" or removing most of the septum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Dr. Akshhat Koshik, who achieved an All India Rank 8 in the INI CET May 2024 exam, emphasizes the critical role of [[balancing_academics_and_personal_life_in_medicine | personal wellbeing]] and a balanced approach during exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His journey highlights that a holistic approach, rather than solely focusing on the exam, contributes significantly to success and overall mental health.

## A Balanced and Low-Pressure Approach
From the beginning of his MBBS journey, Dr. Akshhat did not plan for the PG exam as he would for an undergraduate exam, believing that the time in medical school comes only once in a lifetime and requires balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He observed that many people take on a lot of stress for the PG exam by starting with a similar strategy too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Instead, Dr. Akshhat:
*   Put almost zero pressure on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Watched only a few videos per day, giving himself time to absorb the knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Focused on learning to be a good doctor rather than just aiming for the PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This early foundation made everything "a reflex" during questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Emphasized the importance of being a good doctor first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

This approach allowed him to build a strong clinical base using online videos and actual postings, which was a "low energy task" rather than a "high energy task" that required active effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Overcoming Mental Challenges and Underconfidence
Dr. Akshhat highlighted that the journey is often more about winning the battle with oneself than just the academic preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. He experienced times of underconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> and believes that overcoming this internal struggle counts more in life than any specific rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He advises aspirants to remember that they are here to live and do their best, and not to be overly attached to a single number or rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The focus should be on the process and the means, rather than just the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## The Role of Support Systems
Dr. Akshhat credits his mother for counseling him whenever he felt low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Her support was crucial in helping him believe in himself and do his best, providing immense relief and motivating him to double his studying efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. His parents also provided the necessary space and communication, allowing him to talk to them whenever he needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Personalized Approach and Self-Belief
There is "no correct way of doing it," and half of the journey involves finding the "perfect optimized balance and optimized situation" for individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Dr. Akshhat emphasized the importance of believing in what works best for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He advises categorizing study methods into "high energy," "middle energy," and "lower energy" tasks, allowing students to choose low-energy tasks when exhausted to save brain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Maintaining Wellbeing During Internship
During his [[balancing_internship_responsibilities_and_study | internship]], Dr. Akshhat chose to focus on clinical work rather than dedicated exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. He made sure to use his leaves for travel and consciously avoided studying per se <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He took only one grand test (GT) during his 11-month internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This deliberate choice helped him avoid sadness or depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. His confidence stemmed from his clear concepts developed earlier, allowing him to perform well with just a touch-up before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

His advice:
*   If you're in the OPD, focus on the OPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   If you've decided to take a break, take the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   If you've decided to do something, do it, or give yourself a chance not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Calmness on Exam Day
Dr. Akshhat made sure to relax his mind the day before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. He did not study for most of the day, traveled near the center, talked to friends and family, watched a movie, and slept without stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. This calmness allowed him to perform his best during the three-hour exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Ultimately, Dr. Akshhat's journey underscores that [[balancing_emotions_and_mindset_during_exam_preparation | knowledge]] gained through deep understanding and enjoyment, combined with periods of deliberate rest and strong personal support, leads to sustainable success and peace of mind. He encourages juniors to make their journey their own and completely own it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

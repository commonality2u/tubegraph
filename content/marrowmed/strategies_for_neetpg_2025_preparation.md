This article provides an overview of [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | strategies for NEET PG 2025 preparation]], incorporating insights from medical faculties Dr. Rohan Khandelwal (Surgery), Dr. Sakshi Arora (OBGY), Dr. Rakesh Nair (Medicine), Dr. Ashwani Kumar (Anatomy), and Dr. Nasir (Microbiology). The discussion covers exam predictions, format changes, effective study methods, and resource utilization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## NEET PG 2025 Exam Date Prediction

The National Board of Examination released a tentative schedule for various exams, but the date for NEET PG 2025 was not mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Predicting the exact date is challenging given past behavior of the National Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   **Dr. Rohan Khandelwal's Prediction**: Students should prepare with early April 2025 in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Any time gained beyond this is considered extra for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Dr. Rakesh Nair's Prediction**: Realistically, June end or July 1st could be a possibility due to ongoing counseling for the previous batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, preparing for an April exam acts as a booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The NBO has announced SS exams for March 29th and 30th, 2025, suggesting NEET PG might not be back-to-back with SS exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Dr. Sakshi Arora's Prediction**: Keeping April as a deadline means completing the first reading and two revisions by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Any additional time is a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Students who are waiting for counseling results from the previous NEET PG batch (third or stray round) should continue studying to avoid being caught off guard, as the counseling process can stretch for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Maintaining touch with studies (solving questions, revising notes) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Importance of INI CET Exam

Students are encouraged to take the INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   INI CET is more predictable and its counseling happens on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   It offers a realistic chance of selection and is not just for participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Preparing for INI CET (which is typically held in June) helps maintain motivation and provides a structured timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   There's a significant overlap of topics and questions between INI CET, NEET PG, and FMG exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Especially in surgery, FMG topics are similar to INI CET and NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   INI CET focuses more on first and second-year subjects, which are often rank deciders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> All students preparing for NEET PG should solve INI CET previous year questions (PYQs) and FMG exam papers due to the significant topic overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## [[Exam pattern and preparation strategies for NEET PG 2024 | Changes in NEET PG Exam Format and Question Types]]

NEET PG 2024 was considered a "true bouncer," similar to the tough 2020 exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Key [[changes_in_neet_pg_exam_format_and_question_types | changes in exam format and question types]] include:

*   **Integration**: Increased focus on questions integrating multiple subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Block-based exam**: Five blocks of 40 questions each, with 42 minutes per block (roughly one minute per question) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Questions do not remain on screen for the entire duration, emphasizing the need for quick decision-making and strong temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Concept-based vs. Factual**: The exam tests "reasonable idea" and "ground understanding" rather than rote memorization or deep theoretical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. It's about identifying the core of the question within a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Basics**: More focus is being laid on basic concepts across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> (e.g., spermatogenesis, oogenesis in OBGY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Mixed Question Types**: Roughly 50% single-liner questions and 50% concept-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Image-based Questions**: A significant increase in image-based questions across NEET PG, FMG, and INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Clinical Orientation**: The exam is becoming more clinical, with clinical vignettes and image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Students should focus on keywords and images in clinical branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Marrow Edition 8 Features

Marrow Edition 8 has been updated from Edition 6.5 with several enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>:

*   **Updated Content**: Contains the latest updates in a crisp manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Exam Focus**: Primarily tailored for INI CET, NEET PG, and FMG exams, unlike 6.5 which was recorded during Next PG debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Concise and Palatable**: Less number of hours, with a more concise and easier narration style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. For example, Medicine in Edition 8 has only 125 hours of core content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos**: Over 200 hours of updated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, featuring more tables and mind maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **New Faculties**: Fresh take on Anatomy by Dr. Ashwini Kumar and Microbiology by Dr. Nasir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Notes Availability**: Soft copy notes are live in the app, with PDFs distributed to registered email IDs by the second week of December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Integrated PYQs**: Important PYQs are included within the revision videos themselves, eliminating the need to search for them separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> For Surgery, if a student has seen Edition 6.5, they can supplement it with Baily update videos and PYQ sessions of recent exams, rather than switching to Edition 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

## [[Strategies for NEET PG preparation | Revision Strategies]]

### General Approach for Revision Videos

*   Revision videos alone can yield 75-80% correct answers if watched multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   For shorter subjects, revision videos can be sufficient, but they must be combined with the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Deciding between Revision and Main Videos**: After watching a revision video, if a student scores 70-75% or more correct in the QBank for that topic, they can stick to revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. If performance drops below 60-65%, main video lectures should be used to fill knowledge gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   If relying solely on revision videos and QBank, every line of the revision video notes must be thoroughly understood and learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   For those who have completed main videos and notes:
    *   For the first revision, revise main video notes while keeping revision video notes (e.g., mind maps) in front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Add any necessary points from main notes to revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
    *   For the second revision, switch solely to revision video notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.
*   **Underlining Strategy**: Develop a uniform pattern for underlining notes (e.g., different colors for keywords, concepts, investigations of choice) to create visual impressions and aid recall during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Prioritizing QBank Questions

*   QBank is essential as a learning tool, including PYQs and extra questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
*   If time is short, prioritize previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
*   Prioritize modules in the QBank based on the frequency of PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a> (e.g., do high-yield topics like P first before less frequently asked ones like Rh incompatibility in OBGY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   QBank offers a mixture of question difficulties; custom modules can be created to focus on easy and moderate questions if difficult ones are overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

### Timeline for Preparation

*   **Aim**: Finish all subjects (main or revision videos) by end of January 2025 (+/- 15 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Revision videos total 200 hours, so studying 4 hours/day allows completion in 50 days, with additional time for QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   **First Revision**: Target to finish by mid-March (approx. 45 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Second Revision**: Target to finish by mid-April (approx. 20-25 days), spilling over from mid-March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   This timeline aims for two solid revisions by March end/April beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

### Making and Using a Customized "20th Notebook"

*   The "20th notebook" is for factual errors or concepts consistently forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Customization is Key**: This notebook must be customized to individual needs, focusing on specific facts or topics *you* forget, not a generic one from a topper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Digital Method**: Create a WhatsApp group with only yourself as a participant to quickly jot down facts, classifications (like TNM), or PYQs you can't remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Revision**: Review this digital "notebook" during idle time (travel, ward duties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Delete information once it's committed to memory, focusing on what remains difficult to recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   This approach significantly reduces revision time towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

### Effective Use of Grand Tests (GTs)

*   Take Grand Tests regularly (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Do not wait to finish all subjects before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.
*   **Review on the Same Day**: Review the GT on the same day it's taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
    *   Review **wrong answers** and **guessed answers** (which are tracked in the app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
    *   Do not waste time reviewing correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Categorize Mistakes**:
    1.  **Silly mistakes**: (e.g., misreading "except" or "false") – These reduce with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.
    2.  **Concept-based mistakes**: Worrying. Requires revisiting the main videos to understand and re-attempt the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
    3.  **Factual mistakes**: (e.g., not remembering a specific value or marker) – These facts should be added to your 20th notebook for focused revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Use GTs to practice solving questions quickly, as time is a critical factor in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### Magic Modules

*   A new feature where the app generates high-yield MCQs based on a student's past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.
*   Unlocked by regularly solving questions and making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.
*   Great tool for revision, especially on "off days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   Helps build confidence by showing improvement in understanding previously mistaken concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

### Pearls

*   Extremely important for quick revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.
*   Can be used during idle time (e.g., 10-20 minutes before a class or posting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.
*   Contain concise tables of high-yield information and mapped PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.
*   Available to all, even non-subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

## Addressing Procrastination and Mindset

*   **Overcoming Procrastination**:
    *   Start with small, achievable goals (e.g., making your bed, brushing teeth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.
    *   If struggling to study for long hours, start with 2 hours and gradually increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.
    *   Begin with subjects you enjoy to build momentum and rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Circle of Control**: Dedicate more time to aspects within your control (e.g., how many questions you solve, your daily planning) rather than worrying about external factors like exam dates or difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.
*   **Positive Influence**: Surround yourself with positive people (friends, family) who support you and don't increase anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Regular practice of questions for 36-38 days helps form a habit and makes it a reflex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Competitive Mindset**: Recognize that NEET PG is a competitive exam; the goal is to score above competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. This requires devising a tailor-made strategy and aiming to gain an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>.
*   **Work Smart**: Hard work combined with a proper plan and strategy is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

## Advice for Different Student Groups

*   **Students who have completed 7-8 subjects**:
    *   Start appearing for Grand Tests to identify weak subjects through analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
    *   Combine studying weak subjects with strong ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
    *   Stick to the recommended timeline (finish first reading by January end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.
    *   For the remaining subjects, decide whether to use revision or main videos based on QBank performance (70-75% rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
    *   Address weak subjects now rather than delaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
*   **Working Professionals ([[balancing_study_with_personal_obligations_during_neetpg_preparation | Balancing study with personal obligations during NEETPG preparation]])**:
    *   The suggested timeline and reliance on revision videos are applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.
    *   Watching 4 hours of revision videos and solving 1.5-2 hours of MCQs daily (total 5.5-6 hours) is achievable even while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **Students Entering Internship**:
    *   Leverage fresh knowledge of final year subjects by immediately approaching the QBank and revising notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.
    *   For first and second-year subjects where touch has been lost, pick them up one by one, alternating between clinical and pre/para-clinical subjects to maintain interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>.
    *   Aim to complete all subjects with QBank by mid-internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
    *   A good method: Prepare a custom module of PYTs for a subject in the morning, solve questions during internship downtime, and revise the corresponding topics from main/revision videos upon returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
    *   Focus on high-yielding topics (PYTs) first, then move to lesser-asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

Success in NEET PG relies on consistency, discipline, and believing in oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. Plan and execute your [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | preparation strategies]] effectively, and cultivate internal motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>.

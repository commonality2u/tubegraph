Dr. Trupti, who secured Rank 1 in the INICT exam, shared insights into how she navigated significant setbacks and maintained her motivation throughout her preparation journey. Her approach emphasizes self-awareness, strategic adjustments, and a strong support system.

## Initial Setback and First Steps
Dr. Trupti initially faced a considerable setback, securing a rank of 19,000 in the NEET PG exam last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, she was "okay" with this result because she had not fully prepared for the exam, having only covered about 10 or 11 subjects by that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This perspective allowed her to see the potential for improvement if all subjects were covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Overcoming Subsequent Disappointment
After improving her rank significantly to 115 in the November INICT, Dr. Trupti still didn't secure her preferred branch or institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Despite the pressure to settle for another option, she decided to attempt the exam again.

### Key Factors in Her Decision:
*   **[[family_support_in_academic_success | Parental Support]]**: Her [[the_importance_of_support_systems_in_exam_success | parents supported]] her decision to give it one more shot, which enabled her to take the decision "more firmly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Burnout**: She felt she was "not fatigued" because she hadn't aimed for the November INICT specifically, leaving her with enough energy to push for the May exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Confidence and [[overcoming_challenges_and_persistence_in_achieving_academic_goals | Determination]]**: She possessed confidence in her ability to improve and had observed consistent progress, which required "strong willpower and determination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Turning Point
The November INICT exam itself served as a "major rank confidence booster" for Dr. Trupti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. She utilized this performance to propel herself towards achieving a top rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## [[maintaining_motivation_and_managing_performance_plateaus | Managing Performance Plateaus]] and [[dealing_with_preparation_plateaus | Preparation Plateaus]]
When her Grand Test (GT) scores plateaued, Dr. Trupti implemented specific strategies:
*   **GT Book**: She created a "GT book" during the last two to three months of her preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This small notebook primarily contained mistakes from topics she had already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Immediate Review**: She made it a point to review the GT on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   She reviewed all questions, starting with her weakest subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   Correct answers were quickly scanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Incorrect answers were studied in detail and added to her GT notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Revision of Mistakes**: She regularly revised her GT book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Advice for Students Facing Setbacks
Dr. Trupti highlighted a crucial aspect for students who might be taking a drop year or dealing with unsatisfactory results:
> "It was difficult sir initially I had actually participated in the counseling and did not get to see but the faster we accept it the better we can perform the next year." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>

She emphasized that acknowledging and accepting the outcome, rather than blaming external factors, is essential for moving forward and improving performance in subsequent attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

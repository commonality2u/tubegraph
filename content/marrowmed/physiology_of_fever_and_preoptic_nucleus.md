Fever is a common illness experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> and is considered a form of the body's defense mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. A rise in body temperature enhances the body's defense mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Hypothalamic Involvement
Temperature regulation, including the manifestation of fever, primarily involves the hypothalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Specifically, the hypothalamic set point for temperature is altered during fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Preoptic Nucleus
The most likely and best answer for the specific area involved in fever within the hypothalamus is the preoptic nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This nucleus is located in the anterior region of the hypothalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Mechanism of Fever
Agents capable of causing fever are known as pyrogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. These pyrogens affect heat-sensitive neurons found in the preoptic area (specifically, the preoptic nucleus) of the anterior hypothalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The activity of these heat-sensitive neurons is altered, leading to a change in the hypothalamic set point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

A key molecular agent responsible for altering this set point is prostaglandin E2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Pyrogens induce the release of prostaglandin E2, which then influences the activity of these heat-sensitive neurons in the preoptic area, thereby altering the hypothalamic set point and resulting in fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

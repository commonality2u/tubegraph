Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a technique used to visualize intracranial vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, often performed as part of an MRI brain scan to examine these vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Normal Intracranial Vessel Anatomy on MRA

MRA allows for the identification of major arteries that comprise the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Anterior Circulation
The internal carotid artery (ICA) is a main artery that supplies the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. On each side, the internal carotid artery divides into the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. These arteries have segmented classifications, such as M1, M2, M3, M4 for MCA, and A1, A2 segments for ACA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Posterior Circulation
The vertebral arteries on either side arise from the subclavian arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The two vertebral arteries fuse to form the basilar artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, which then divides into the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## MRA Findings in Acute Stroke

MRA is crucial for diagnosing various cerebrovascular conditions in the context of stroke.

### Thrombosis or Occlusion
In a patient presenting with acute stroke, MRA can reveal the absence of signal from an artery, indicating a thrombus or occlusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. For example, if the signal from the left anterior cerebral artery is not seen, it suggests thrombosis within that artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This finding indicates an A.C. territory infarct on diffusion-weighted images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Similarly, a paucity of blood vessels on either the right or left side, when comparing MCA branches, could indicate an MCA thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This relates to [[Chronic and Acute Arterial Occlusion | arterial occlusion]].

### Aneurysms
In cases of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), MRA can identify underlying causes like aneurysms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. An out-pouching from an internal carotid artery, as seen on a post-contrast MRA, indicates an aneurysm, such as a left internal carotid artery aneurysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Ruptured berry aneurysms are a common cause of acute SAH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Moya Moya Disease
Moya Moya disease is a peculiar condition affecting children who present with neurological deficits, loss of consciousness, weakness, and cranial nerve palsies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. On MRA, it appears as a chronic gradual narrowing of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, which is not an acute thrombosis or occlusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

As a compensatory mechanism for the chronic narrowing, the body creates multiple collaterals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. When an invasive angiography is performed, these numerous collateral arteries attempting to supply the brain from its base become opacified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. This phenomenon is known as the "puff of smoke appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>, a significant [[Radiological signs and their significance in clinical diagnosis | radiological sign]] on angiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

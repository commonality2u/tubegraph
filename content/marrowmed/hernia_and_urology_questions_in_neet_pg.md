The NEET PG 2024 surgery recall highlighted a significant shift in question patterns, particularly regarding the number of [[Urology questions in NEET PG exam | Urology]] questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While previous exams typically included only one or two [[Urology questions in NEET PG exam | Urology]] questions, Session One of NEET PG 2024 featured a surprisingly high number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Both sessions had an equal number of surgery questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Session Two was comparatively more challenging due to lengthier questions, trickier options, and more images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There was a reduced focus on general surgery and trauma, with more emphasis on systemic surgery and conceptual questions across both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Questions were conceptual and required understanding rather than rote memorization of facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Hernia Questions

### Umbilical Hernia
A common scenario involved a patient with an umbilical swelling that was initially asymptomatic and reducible but became painful and non-reducible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Irreducibility indicates obstruction, and inflammation suggests potential strangulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Management** Since a mesh cannot be used in the presence of infection or strangulation, the appropriate management is heriorrhaphy (suturing the defect) along with umbilectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Classification**
    *   **Uncomplicated Hernia:** Characterized by reducibility and a cough impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Obstructed Hernia:** Presents with signs of obstruction, irreducibility, abdominal pain, vomiting, and distension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Strangulated Hernia:** Similar to an obstructed hernia but includes compromised blood supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A key surgical dictum is that "all obstructed hernias should be treated as strangulated unless proved otherwise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Repair Types**
    *   **Herniotomy:** Involves no repair of the defect, leading to a high recurrence rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Heriorrhaphy:** Involves suturing the defect together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   **Hernioplasty:** The current standard of care, utilizing synthetic mesh materials (e.g., Prolene, Vicryl) for the least recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. However, synthetic meshes cannot be used in infected or strangulated cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In such situations, biological meshes (acellular human dermis, acellular porcine dermis) or heriorrhaphy are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
This condition is a recurring topic in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Most Common Type:** The most common congenital diaphragmatic hernia in neonates is a Bochdalek hernia, which is left posterolateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Hiatal hernia is the most common diaphragmatic hernia overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Types and Embryology:**
    *   **Bochdalek Hernia:** Left posterolateral, most common type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Results from defective development of the pleuroperitoneal canal or membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Common herniated structures include the stomach, spleen, and transverse colon, with the stomach being most common in left-sided hernias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   **Morgagni Hernia:** Right anteromedial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Caused by defective central tendon of the diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The transverse colon is the most common herniated structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation & Management:**
    *   Infants present with respiratory distress and a scaphoid abdomen due to bowel herniation into the thoracic cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   **Contraindicated:** Bag and mask ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   **Preferred Ventilation:** IV intermittent positive pressure ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   **Most Common Cause of Death:** Pulmonary hypoplasia, as the herniated bowel prevents lung development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Second Most Common Cause of Death:** Pulmonary hypertension, treated with inhaled nitrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
    *   **Prenatal Diagnosis/Treatment:** Can be diagnosed *in utero* by imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. *In utero* surgery, called FETO (Fetal Endoscopic Tracheal Occlusion), promotes lung development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
    *   **Surgical Repair:** Involves a circular incision over the diaphragm and mesh repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Patent Vitellointestinal Duct (Omphalomesenteric Duct)
A baby presenting with fecal discharge from the umbilicus is a classic sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This indicates a patent connection between the ileum and the umbilicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Other Abnormalities (from vitellointestinal duct obliteration):**
    *   **Normal:** Duct obliterates completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
    *   **Meckel's Diverticulum:** Persistence of the intestinal end of the duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Follows the "Rule of 2s" (2% population, 2 inches long, 2 feet proximal to ileocecal junction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
    *   **Cyst:** Entire duct obliterates at both ends, but a central portion remains as a cyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
    *   **Umbilical Polyp:** Persistence of the umbilical end, leading to mucoid or sometimes bloody discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
    *   **Fibrous Band:** A fibrous band may remain, around which bowel can rotate, causing volvulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

### Inguinal Hernia Surgery
During open inguinal hernia surgery, a structure marked with a black arrow, appearing as a wide, glistening structure being separated from the hernial sac, is likely the testicular vein or pampiniform plexus of veins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. Obturator and femoral veins are much deeper, and the inferior epigastric vein is closer to the deep ring, not the sac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

## Urology Questions

### Instruments for DJ Stent Placement
An X-ray showing a DJ (Double J) stent requires a cystoscope for placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. The cystoscope is used to enter the bladder and then the ureter to position the stent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. DJ stents are used to treat stones (allowing small fragments to pass), bridge strictures, or identify ureters during complex surgeries like colorectal cancer resections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

### Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Histopathology
A patient with flank pain and hematuria, whose histology shows plant-like cells and raisin-like nuclei, indicates Chromophobe RCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. These cells are rich in mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Types of RCC:**
    *   **Clear Cell RCC:** Most common type, characterized by glycogen-rich cells that appear clear due to dissolution during slide preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
    *   **Chromophobe RCC:** Has the best prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and loss of multiple chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Histopathology shows plant-like cells and raisin-like nuclei; cytokeratin is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Differentiated from oncocytoma, a benign kidney tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.
    *   **Papillary RCC:** May show psammoma bodies (folky of dystrophic calcification) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

### Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV)
A male child unable to pass urine, with a history of recurrent UTIs and a catheter that can be passed easily, suggests PUV, especially with a "keyhole defect" on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** PUV act as one-way valves, obstructing urine outflow but allowing a catheter to pass inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Classification:** Young's classification describes three types, with Type I being the most common, located just below the verumontanum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** Keyhole defect seen on ultrasound and micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Management:** Fulguration of the valves (burning them) to open the urinary passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

### Bladder Exstrophy (Ectopia Vesicae)
An image of exposed posterior bladder wall with urine dribbling, and pubic diastasis, points to bladder exstrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
*   **Defect:** Deficient anterior abdominal wall and anterior bladder wall below the umbilicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Associated Anomalies:**
    *   Pubic diastasis (widely separated pubic bones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>, corrected by iliac osteotomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
    *   Undescended testes in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
    *   Bifid clitoris in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
    *   Congenital inguinal hernias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
*   **Management:** Requires multiple surgeries for correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **Distinction from other abdominal wall defects:** Omphalocele involves a sac covering extruded organs, appearing through the umbilicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Gastroschisis has no sac and is lateral to the umbilicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

### Renal Tuberculosis
A patient with a history of tuberculosis presenting with dysuria, sterile pyuria, and a dilated ureteric orifice (golf-hole ureteric orifice) is characteristic of renal tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Sterile Pyuria:** Pus cells are seen on microscopy, but bacterial culture is sterile because *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* does not grow on routine media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Features:** Can lead to papillary ulcers, perinephric abscess, and a "putty kidney" (calcified, pus-filled, non-functioning kidney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Hematuria and pain are common symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Ureterocele presents as a "cobra head" or "adder head" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Renal Stones and Crystals
A patient with renal colic, recurrent UTIs, and hexagonal crystals on urine analysis indicates cysteine stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Cystine Stones:** Hexagonal crystals, very hard, radiopaque, formed in acidic urine, difficult to break with ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Other Crystals/Stones:**
    *   **Struvite/Triple Phosphate Stones:** Coffin-lid appearance, seen in alkaline urine due to *Proteus* infection, radiopaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
    *   **Uric Acid Crystals:** Appear like glass shards, formed in acidic urine, radiolucent (most common radiolucent stones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
    *   **Calcium Oxalate Stones:** Most common type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Monohydrate: dumbbell shaped, very hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Dihydrate: envelope shaped, formed in acidic urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
    *   **Ammonium Urate Stones:** Seen in laxative abuse, radiolucent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

### Penile Cancer
Penile cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) is a frequently asked topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Patients often present with an ulceroproliferative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Diagnosis is by biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Treatment Aspects:**
    *   **Primary Tumor Treatment:**
        *   **Partial Penectomy:** For small, distally placed lesions where a 2 cm stump can be achieved with a 0.5 cm margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
        *   **Total Amputation (Penectomy):** For large (T3), proximally placed tumors, or when a 2 cm stump cannot be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
    *   **Lymph Node Management:** Lymphatic spread primarily involves inguinal lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. The most common cause of death is erosion of femoral vessels due to involved inguinal or obturator lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
        *   **No Enlarged Lymph Nodes:**
            *   Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (preferably with dual marker technique) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
            *   If sentinel biopsy is unavailable or not an option, superficial inguinal clearance is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
        *   **Enlarged and Involved Lymph Nodes (confirmed by FNAC):**
            *   Ilioinguinal lymph node clearance (a morbid procedure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
            *   Radiotherapy can be an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario:** A Stage III penile cancer with no clinically palpable inguinal lymph nodes requires penectomy with superficial inguinal lymph node dissection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Surgical Image:** An image showing removal of the penis and cuts on both sides of the thigh/inguinal region suggests total penectomy with bilateral ilioinguinal dissection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.

### Testicular Torsion
A male child experiencing acute scrotal pain with a gangrenous (black) testis on surgical exploration indicates testicular torsion with gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.
*   **Risk Factors:** Bell Clapper testes (high investment of tunica vaginalis, most common predisposing cause) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>, testicular inversion, undescended testes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Differentiation from Epididymo-orchitis:**
    *   **Prehn's Sign:** Lifting the involved testis reduces pain in epididymitis, but increases it in torsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
    *   **Deming Sign:** Testis undergoing torsion lies at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.
    *   **Angel Sign:** Transversely placed testis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
*   **Prognosis:** Untwisting within 6 hours offers 100% salvage chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>, but only 20% if delayed over 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. A 720° twist causes more rapid ischemia than 360° <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.
*   **Management:** Regardless of affected side surgery (orchidectomy for gangrene or derotation with three-point fixation), a prophylactic orchidopexy should always be performed on the contralateral side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Torsion of testicular appendage (cyst of Morgagni) causes a "blue dot sign" but does not involve the entire testis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

### Urethral Stricture
A 45-year-old male with acute urinary retention, drained suprapubically, and an RGU (retrograde urethrogram) showing a long segment stricture in the bulbar urethra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Short, Incomplete Stricture:** Visual Internal Urethrotomy (VIU/OIU) where the strictured portion is cut endoscopically and dilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.
    *   **Short, Complete Stricture:** Excision with end-to-end anastomosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>.
    *   **Long Segment Stricture (as in this case):** Excision plus buccal mucosal graft (urethroplasty) to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. Penile foreskin can also be used, but buccal mucosal graft is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>.

Effective preparation for exams like FMG involves a strategic approach to [[importance_of_revision_and_practice_questions | revision]] and consistent practice, particularly through grand tests. Dr. Rajeshwari, who achieved a score of 246 in the FMG January 2025 exam, shares her insights on these crucial aspects of her preparation [00:00:12].

## Strategic Preparation and Content Mastery

Dr. Rajeshwari began her preparation in her fifth year of undergraduation, subscribing to Marrow with the goal of having a strong grasp of knowledge closer to the exam [00:00:36]. She believed that preparing at the level of NEET PG and INI-CET would ensure a good score in FMG, as the conducting boards and question quality are becoming increasingly similar and clinically oriented across these exams [00:01:26].

Her daily routine included:
*   Watching Marrow videos for four to five hours [00:02:11].
*   Making her own notes while watching videos, often at 1.5x or 1.8x speed for familiar subjects [00:02:16].
*   Solving module-related questions from the question bank immediately after watching videos [00:02:20].
*   Adding any extra information found in the question bank to her notes [00:02:52].
*   For shorter subjects, she utilized [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revision]] videos but still made her own notes [00:03:22]. If a concept from a [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revision]] video was unclear, she would refer back to the regular videos for a complete understanding [00:04:04].
*   The core principle was to understand the concept being tested, irrespective of whether the information came from regular videos, [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revision]] videos, or the question bank [00:04:27].

Dr. Rajeshwari emphasizes that Marrow faculty simplify complex topics, making them easily understandable in a single viewing [00:11:20].

## The Role of Question Banks

Solving question banks was an integral part of her strategy:
*   She aimed to complete almost all topics in the question bank [00:05:22].
*   She consistently scored around 80% in the question bank after watching the corresponding videos [00:05:39].
*   Solving questions immediately after watching videos helped in better understanding and immediate [[importance_of_revision_for_neetpg_and_ini_exams | revision]] of the content [00:05:54].

Towards the end of her preparation, Dr. Rajeshwari heavily relied on Marrow's custom modules, doing approximately four per day, each containing 50 questions. This practice of solving 200 random questions daily helped her maintain confidence and stay in touch with the material from various subjects [00:08:30].

## Significance of Grand Tests

Grand tests (GTs) played a crucial role in Dr. Rajeshwari's success:
*   She started taking GTs in October 2024 and achieved impressive scores, including 127 out of 150 in her last GT [00:06:11].
*   She advises students to overcome the fear of low scores in GTs, noting that initial scores might be low but will gradually improve [00:10:30].
*   Her GT scores closely mirrored her performance in the main FMG exam, highlighting their predictive value [00:06:46].
*   GTs provide an authentic exam simulation, including question quality and trickiness [00:06:54].
*   After each GT, she utilized the analytics feature to identify her weak subjects [00:07:15]. She would then revise these weak subjects multiple times to strengthen her understanding [00:07:24]. These analytics transparently reveal true weak areas, guiding focused [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | revision]] [00:08:04].
*   She strongly advises juniors to start taking grand tests early in their preparation, unlike her, who started them relatively late [00:10:49].

In summary, consistent engagement with video lectures, dedicated note-taking, immediate practice with question banks, and early, regular participation in grand tests, combined with analytical review of performance, are vital for exam success [00:10:58].

From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

Dr. Baseli, an orthopedics faculty member with Maro, discussed the latest [[INICET May 2025 preparation strategies | INICET May 2025]] orthopedics recall questions, focusing specifically on pure orthopedics-based questions [00:00:00]. The paper was described as interesting and slightly tricky [00:00:10], featuring some questions with overlap into anatomy and rheumatology [00:00:12].

The questions largely covered standard, expected topics [00:00:29], including:
*   Infections of the bone (two questions) [00:00:33]
*   Upper limb trauma [00:00:34]
*   Lower limb trauma [00:00:36]
*   Bone tumors [00:00:38]

The primary goal of the discussion was to learn the concepts behind the questions to better prepare for similar questions in future exams [00:00:53].

## Key Recall Questions and Concepts

### Intratrochanteric Fracture Management
A 75-year-old lady presented with an intratrochanteric fracture, a frequently tested concept in recent years [00:01:01]. Fractures around the hip are a very important topic for the [[INICET exam pattern and preparation | INICET exam]] and DPG exams [00:01:27].

*   **Fracture Types around the Hip** [00:01:11]:
    *   **Neck of femur fracture (Intracapsular)**: Occurs inside the hip joint capsule [00:01:35]. This type of fracture disturbs blood supply, leading to a risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) and non-union [00:03:21].
    *   **Intratrochanteric fracture (Extracapsular)**: Occurs outside the capsule [00:01:37]. This type typically does not disrupt blood supply but can result in malunion, specifically coxa vara [00:03:27].
*   **Intratrochanteric Fracture Management** [00:01:46]:
    *   For intratrochanteric fractures, the patient's age is not the primary concern [00:01:50].
    *   The main goal is to maintain the neck-shaft angle to prevent coxa vara, which can cause an "adrenaline bug gate" and limp [00:03:55].
    *   **Management of choice**: Proximal femoral nail (PFN) or dynamic hip screw (DHS) [00:01:54]. The PFN is considered the best device [00:04:10].
    *   **Alternative (if inoperable)**: Boot and bar traction or de-rotation boot to prevent external rotation, if the patient has comorbidities or cannot undergo surgery [00:04:51]. This is not a standard protocol [00:05:13].
*   **Neck of Femur Fracture Management** [00:05:22]:
    *   For intracapsular neck of femur fractures, the patient's age is crucial [00:05:28].
    *   **Age > 65 years**: Hemiarthroplasty (replacement of head and neck) using bipolar, Austin-Moore, or Thomson prosthesis (bipolar being the best) [00:05:40]. If there is pre-existing hip osteoarthritis, total hip arthroplasty (replacement of head, neck, and acetabular cup) is preferred [00:06:02].
    *   **Age < 65 years and fresh fracture (<3 weeks old)**: Closed reduction and internal fixation with cannulated cancellous screws (three screws in an inverted triangle fashion) [00:06:31].

### Scaphoid Fracture Diagnosis and Management
A 35-year-old laborer presented with pain and swelling over the anatomical snuff box after falling on an outstretched hand, with unremarkable X-rays [00:07:23]. This clinical presentation strongly suggests a scaphoid fracture [00:07:56].

*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: Scaphoid fractures are primarily clinical diagnoses, as initial X-rays can be negative in 25-30% of cases [00:08:11].
*   **Next Step in Management**:
    1.  Assume it is a scaphoid fracture and apply a thumb spica cast [00:08:29].
    2.  Review the patient after 10-14 days and repeat X-rays [00:08:34].
    3.  If a fracture line becomes visible (due to osteolysis), continue casting for 6-8 weeks until healing [00:08:40].
    4.  If X-rays are still negative and the patient has no pain, treatment is complete [00:09:05].
    5.  If X-rays are still negative but the patient continues to have pain, consider further imaging like an MRI scan to rule out a scaphoid fracture [00:09:11].
*   **Role of Advanced Imaging**: MRI or CT can provide an immediate diagnosis if essential, but they are not routinely done initially due to cost and because management typically starts with immobilization regardless of initial X-ray findings [00:10:30].

### Bone Tumor Radiographic Appearance (Osteosarcoma vs. Ewing's Sarcoma)
A 17-year-old boy presented with leg pain and difficulty walking, with X-rays showing a sunburst appearance and Codman's triangle [00:11:07].

*   **Likely Diagnosis**: Osteosarcoma [00:11:21].
*   **Periosteal Reactions**:
    *   **Sunray/sunburst appearance and Codman's triangle**: Typically associated with osteosarcoma [00:11:24].
    *   **Onion peel appearance**: Often seen in Ewing's sarcoma [00:11:46].
    *   **Thick/solid periosteal reaction (involucrum)**: Usually occurs in osteomyelitis [00:12:37].
*   **Important Note**: Periosteal reactions are non-specific and not pathognomonic [00:11:36]. Other factors like age, bone involvement, location, and especially biopsy findings are more critical for diagnosis [00:12:20].
*   **Ewing's Sarcoma Key Findings**: CD99 positivity, MIC2 gene mutation, small round blue cells with pseudo-rosettes, and translocation 11;22 [00:13:06].

### Chronic Osteomyelitis Causative Organisms
A 12-year-old boy presented with leg pain, swelling, and warmth. Lab investigations showed elevated ESR and CRP. X-rays revealed a sclerotic bone fragment surrounded by lucencies in the medullary cavity (sequestrum surrounded by involucrum) [00:13:20].

*   **Diagnosis**: Chronic osteomyelitis [00:14:02].
*   **Most Common Cause**: *Staphylococcus aureus* [00:14:40].
*   **Unlikely Cause (from options)**: *Klebsiella* [00:14:50].
*   **Other Common Organisms**: *E. coli*, *Streptococcus*, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* [00:14:51].
*   **Exceptions (Specific Associations)**:
    *   **Sickle cell disease**: *Salmonella* [00:15:14]
    *   **IV drug abuse**: *Pseudomonas* [00:15:17]
    *   **Animal bites**: *Pasteurella* [00:15:20]
    *   **Human bites**: *Eikenella* [00:15:24]
    *   **Prolonged parenteral therapy**: Fungal organisms [00:15:26]

### WHO Recommended Investigation for Spinal Tuberculosis
The question asked about the WHO recommended investigation of choice for spinal tuberculosis [00:15:36].

*   **Gold Standard**: Culture of tissue collected from the infection site (e.g., via CT-guided biopsy after MRI localization) [00:16:00]. However, culture is time-consuming (2-6 weeks) and invasive, making it unsuitable as a primary diagnostic test [00:16:34].
*   **WHO Recommendation (2021, updated 2024)**: Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), also known as GeneXpert test or NAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) [00:16:42].
    *   **Benefits**: This automated diagnostic test identifies *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DNA and detects rifampicin resistance within 2 hours [00:17:51].
    *   **Purpose**: To make a quick diagnosis, especially for extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, as it is less invasive than culture [00:17:29].

## Exam Preparation Advice
The speaker emphasized the importance of sustained effort in the final weeks leading up to the exam [00:18:50]. It is crucial to continue studying and revising, even if anxiety or fear is present [00:19:03]. Past performance in other exams (like [[INICET exam preparation strategies | INICET]] or grand tests) does not reflect future performance [00:19:43]. Continuous revision ensures facts are at the "tip of your brain" just before the exam, as these are primarily fact-based exams [00:20:00]. A difference of just 5-6 MCQs can significantly alter the outcome, impacting qualification status or college choice [00:20:26].

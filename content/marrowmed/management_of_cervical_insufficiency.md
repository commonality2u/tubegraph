## Definition
[[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | Cervical insufficiency]], also known as cervical incompetence, is characterized by the spontaneous dilation of the cervix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Normally, the internal os of the cervix remains closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In patients with [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]], the internal os automatically dilates, which can lead to second trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A key historical finding is painless, recurrent second trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Diagnosis
The [[diagnosis_of_cervical_incompetence | diagnosis of cervical incompetence]] can be made based on patient history or ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### History-Based Diagnosis
If a patient reports two or more painless second trimester abortions, this confirms a case of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]], and no further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Ultrasound-Based Diagnosis
If there is a history of only one painless second trimester abortion, a Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS) should be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The investigation of choice for [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical incompetence]] or [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] is TVUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

On TVUS, if the length of the cervix is less than or equal to 2.5 cm, it indicates [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For reference, the length of the cervix in a normal pregnant female is 4 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

#### Cervical Shape Changes on Ultrasound
As the cervix dilates due to insufficiency, its shape changes progressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
1.  **T-shaped:** Normal appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  **Y-shaped:** First stage of dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **V-shaped:** Further dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  **U-shaped:** The final dilated shape, where the cervix becomes part of the lower uterine segment (known as "taking up of cervix") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]], the cervix has to be U-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Management
The primary management options for [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] are progesterone and [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Management Based on Clinical Scenarios
1.  **Pregnant female with history of two or more second trimester abortions:**
    *   No need for ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Proceed with [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] plus progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
2.  **Pregnant female with history of one second trimester abortion:**
    *   **Measure cervical length via TVUS.**
        *   If cervical length is less than or equal to 2.5 cm: Perform [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] plus progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
        *   If cervical length is more than 2.5 cm: Give only progesterone (no cerclage, as it doesn't meet the criteria for cerclage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
3.  **Pregnant female with no history of abortion, but cervical length is less than 2.5 cm (coincidental finding):**
    *   This does not justify [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   Give only progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Progesterone
Progesterone is given in various scenarios as part of the [[drug_management_in_obstetrics | drug management in obstetrics]] for [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, often alongside [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cervical Cerclage]]
[[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indica tions | Cervical cerclage]] is a surgical procedure that can be performed in both pregnant and non-pregnant females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

#### Types of [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cervical Cerclage]]
1.  **Transvaginal Cerclage (in pregnant females):**
    *   **McDonald Cerclage:** The most commonly performed transvaginal cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, using a purse-string suture applied to the porio vaginalis (the part of the cervix inside the vagina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Shirodkar Cerclage:** Another type of transvaginal cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Wurm Cerclage:** Used as an emergency or "rescue" cerclage when the patient is already dilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. It involves two stitches, anterior and posterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
2.  **Transabdominal Cerclage (Benson and DeLee Cerclage):**
    *   Can be done laparoscopically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   Indications: Failed transvaginal cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Drawbacks: It's an abdominal surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The sutures are typically not removed until the family is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, meaning future deliveries must be via Cesarean section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
3.  **Non-Pregnant Females:**
    *   **Lash and Lash Procedure:** Involves removing a part of the defective cervix and then stitching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This procedure is rarely done today due to complications, as it makes the cervix very fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Patients undergoing this procedure are advised to have a 3-month gap before conceiving and deliver via Cesarean section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   **Laparoscopic Cerclage:** The preferred method in non-pregnant females these days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

#### Suture Material and Application
A monofilament non-absorbable suture is used for [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cerclage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Purse-string sutures are applied on the porio vaginalis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

#### Timing of [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cerclage]]
The ideal time for [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cerclage]] is between 14 to 16 weeks of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The earliest it can be done is 12 weeks, and the latest is 24 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:00]</a>.

## [[contraindications_for_cervical_circlage | Contraindications for Cervical Cerclage]]
[[contraindications_for_cervical_circlage | Cerclage]] is contraindicated in the following situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>:
*   Ruptured membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Chorioamnionitis (infection of the amniotic fluid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   Bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
*   Uterine contractions (indicating onset of labor, though rescue cerclage like Wurm can be attempted with poor prognosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
*   Cervical dilation more than or equal to 3 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
*   Gross congenital anomalies of the fetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   Current pelvic infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
*   Placenta previa (relative contraindication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>

## Post-Management Considerations
Whenever [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cerclage]] is performed, progesterone should also be administered to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

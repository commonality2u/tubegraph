Dr. Naresh, who secured Rank 1 in the INI-CET exam, emphasizes the importance of balancing [[balancing_medical_studies_with_internship_responsibilities | medical studies with internship responsibilities]] during medical school. His own journey highlights the challenges and strategies involved in preparing for competitive exams while managing a demanding internship [00:01:53].

## Challenges During Internship

Internship duties can be "very heavy" and "hectic," making it difficult to consistently meet daily study targets [00:05:15]. Dr. Naresh admits that during his May INI-CET attempt, which coincided with his internship, he was not "the best prepared" and lacked "INI-CET oriented specific preparation" due to a "paucity of time" [00:01:57]. He relied on his "Baseline knowledge" and did not solve many previous year's questions (PYQs) for that exam [00:02:08].

## Strategies for Preparation

### Time Management and Daily Targets
Dr. Naresh began his serious preparation during his internship, setting "daily targets" for himself [00:04:57], [00:05:02]. He understood that missing targets was sometimes inevitable due to demanding internship duties, but stressed the importance of not giving up, treating each new day as an opportunity to complete targets, and compensating for lost time by valuing every moment available for study [00:05:15], [00:05:22], [00:05:26], [00:27:28], [00:27:31], [00:27:33], [00:27:36].

### Utilizing Question Banks (QBank)
He strategically used the Marrow QBank, solving modules *after* thoroughly studying a particular topic from his theory sources [00:04:48], [00:04:50], [00:05:31], [00:05:34]. This approach helped him identify specific areas targeted by exams, which standard textbooks might not emphasize [00:05:51], [00:05:55]. He aimed for 70-80% correctness in QBank modules, using questions beyond this threshold to learn new, difficult information or recent updates not found in textbooks [00:06:30], [00:06:44], [00:07:03], [00:07:06].

He managed a large number of bookmarks (around 5,000) by revisiting them, especially during night duties or lighter periods [00:08:45], [00:08:47], [00:08:56], [00:09:00], [00:09:03]. He utilized Marrow's three-category bookmark feature to prioritize "key areas" or "recent updates" [00:09:18], [00:09:20], [00:09:26]. He also used the "magic module" for revisiting incorrect MCQs [00:09:56], [00:09:59]. For custom modules, he primarily used "#clinical" for NEET and "#recent updates" tags [00:10:42], [00:11:35], [00:11:42], [00:11:45].

### Grand Tests (GTs) Approach
Dr. Naresh started taking Grand Tests relatively late, around January, when he was nearing 75% completion of his internship [00:16:21], [00:16:59], [00:17:03], [00:17:10], [00:17:12]. Initially, he took them approximately once a month [00:18:08], [00:18:10]. Due to heavy internship postings, he couldn't take many GTs towards the end of his internship [00:18:18], [00:18:20], [00:18:21], [00:18:24], [00:18:30].

After his May INI-CET result, he started giving GTs "very frequently," sometimes two to three per week, to compensate for a perceived lack of exam practice [00:18:37], [00:18:40], [00:18:44].

#### Unique GT Strategy
Due to limited time, Dr. Naresh adopted a unique approach for GTs:
*   He did not solve them in a single three-hour slot [00:19:31], [00:19:49].
*   Instead, he broke them into 40-45 minute slots, simulating exam conditions [00:19:53], [00:5:55], [00:20:02], [00:20:04], [00:20:07].
*   After each slot, he reviewed only the wrong questions or those that provided new information, taking 15-20 minutes [00:20:14], [00:20:16], [00:20:19], [00:20:34], [00:20:38], [00:20:40], [00:20:41], [00:20:44]. This allowed him to complete a 45-question block and review it within an hour [00:20:47], [00:20:51].
*   This strategy allowed him to utilize the rest of his day for personal study and progressing through the syllabus [00:21:17], [00:21:19], [00:21:21], [00:21:26].

He used GT analysis to identify weak subjects or topics and would revisit those areas [00:22:07], [00:22:09], [00:22:19], [00:22:21], [00:22:28].

## Advice for Students in Internship

Dr. Naresh recommends that students starting their internship should begin taking Grand Tests earlier than he did [00:28:11], [00:28:17], [00:28:20]. He views his late start as a "flaw" and believes that early GTs, even sitting for the full three hours, provide crucial insights into one's weaknesses and overall standing in the competition [00:28:24], [00:28:27], [00:28:41], [00:28:45], [00:28:49], [00:28:51]. A positive result in early GTs can serve as a "booster" and "positive reinforcement" for future months of preparation [00:29:12], [00:29:15], [00:29:25], [00:29:28].

He advises students to:
*   Set daily targets and persevere even if they fall behind [00:27:25], [00:27:28], [00:27:31], [00:27:33], [00:27:36].
*   Utilize question banks to identify weak areas and revise them [00:27:39], [00:27:43], [00:27:46].
*   Recognize that the journey is long with stumbles, but "just don't stop" and "keep on continuing" [00:27:50], [00:27:52], [00:27:55].

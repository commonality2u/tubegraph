Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. It is a critical condition requiring prompt diagnosis and appropriate management.

## Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy

The classic triad of ectopic pregnancy includes abdominal pain, bleeding per vaginum (PV), and amenorrhea, typically lasting for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Presenting Symptoms
*   **Abdominal Pain** is the most common presenting symptom, observed in approximately 90% of patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   In a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, abdominal pain is caused by hemoperitoneum (blood in the peritoneal cavity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This can lead to **shoulder tip pain**, known as the Done Forth sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   In an unruptured ectopic pregnancy, pain results from the stretching of the fallopian tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The fallopian tube is innervated by nerves from T10, T11, and L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Other associated symptoms may include difficulty (likely referring to urinary/bowel issues), syncope attacks, and orthostatic hypotension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Risk Factors
*   [[PIDC infections | PIDC infections]] (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) are a major risk factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Tubal surgeries also increase the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Contraceptives: While contraceptives generally decrease the absolute risk of any pregnancy, including ectopic, their failure can lead to an increased relative risk of ectopic pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Biochemical Markers
*   **Progesterone levels**: Low values of progesterone are typically seen in ectopic pregnancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, there is no specific value that can completely rule out ectopic pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Progesterone levels in ectopic pregnancy are higher than in a non-pregnant female but lower than in a normal pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Low progesterone levels are also observed in abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **hCG**: In pregnancy, hCG is formed by the syncytiotrophoblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. hCG prevents the luteolysis of the corpus luteum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Management of Ectopic Pregnancy

Management depends on the stability of the patient and the presence of rupture.

### Contraindications for Methotrexate
*   Oral methotrexate is **not** a viable medical alternative for ectopic pregnancy in patients presenting with shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   In cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy (indicated by shock and BP 90/60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>), methotrexate is contraindicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Methotrexate is typically given intramuscularly (IM), not orally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

> [!important]
> If a patient presents with shock, it indicates a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and surgical intervention is required. Methotrexate is not indicated in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

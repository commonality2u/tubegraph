Blood culture and the Vidal test are diagnostic investigations used in microbiology, particularly for identifying specific infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>.

## Role in Diagnosing Typhoid Fever

Both blood culture and the Vidal test are relevant in the diagnosis of typhoid fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:34">[03:30:34]</a>.

### Blood Culture
Blood culture is highly effective for diagnosing typhoid fever, especially in the early stages of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. It is positive in more than 90% of cases during the first week of symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>.

### Vidal Test
The Vidal test detects antibodies, which typically appear in the second week of typhoid fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:03">[04:01:03]</a>.

## Other Applications of Blood Culture

Blood cultures are also used to identify bacterial infections in other contexts. For instance, *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is often grown from blood cultures in patients with a central venous line, making it the most common cause of bacteremia in such individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:02">[06:00:02]</a>. If antibiotics based on sensitivity profiles do not resolve the fever, it may indicate biofilm formation by the bacteria, which reduces susceptibility to antibiotics by acting as a mechanical barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:12">[06:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:07">[06:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. In such cases, the infected catheter typically needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

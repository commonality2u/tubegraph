Dr. Jasurya, who secured Rank 5 in the May 2025 INI-CET exam, leveraged [[utilizing_educational_apps_like_marrow_for_medical_studies | Maro]] as his exclusive study resource throughout his preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He used [[marrow_as_a_primary_study_resource | Maro]] for notes, QBank, and Grand Tests (GTs), expressing immense gratitude for its comprehensive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Early Engagement and Foundation Building

Dr. Jasurya's initial exposure to [[utilizing_online_resources_like_marrow_effectively | Maro]] was during his third year of MBBS when he subscribed to a two-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For about 1.5 years, he used [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | Maro video lectures]] to supplement his college lectures and gain a sense of the subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This early engagement allowed him to build a strong foundational knowledge base, which proved crucial later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Dedicated Exam Preparation

After an unplanned break for UK exam preparation, Dr. Jasurya fully committed to the INI-CET and NEET-PG exams around eight months before the actual exam in May 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. He re-subscribed to a two-year [[marrow_subscription_and_its_impact_on_exam_preparation | Maro plan]] and adopted a more focused preparation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Core Resources Used:

*   **Main Notes**: His primary source for preparation was [[impact_of_platform_resources_like_maro_on_exam_success | Maro]]'s main notes, which he used to reinforce topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He opted for ready-made notes and did not add information from videos or the question bank to keep them separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Question Bank (QBank)**: He consistently solved relevant QBank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Simultaneous Approach**: He used the QBank simultaneously with reading notes, testing himself on what he had just read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   **Application of Knowledge**: The QBank helped him understand how questions are framed, identify trick words, and apply his knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   **High-Yield Concepts**: He used the QBank to focus on high-yield questions for revision and to condense his main notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   **Coverage**: He completed approximately 80% of the QBank, covering 669 modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He also did all previous year questions (PQs) twice before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Review**: He bookmarked incorrect PQ questions for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: This was a cornerstone of his strategy.
    *   **Regularity**: He took a GT every 10 to 15 days consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   **Baseline Assessment**: His first GT score without preparation was 118 correct out of 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Score Progression**: His first "proper" GT, six months before the exam, yielded 136 correct questions and a rank of around 300-400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Scores gradually climbed to 150-155 after the first revision, and 165-175 after the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   **Rank Consistency**: His best GT rank was in the top 20, and he consistently ranked between 50 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   **GT Review Strategy**:
        *   He treated GTs like the main exam, maintaining focus for 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
        *   Initially, he reviewed 20 questions a day, completing the review of all 200 questions over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
        *   Towards the end, due to time constraints, he reviewed only the questions he got wrong on the same day he took the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[0:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
        *   He used the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | Maro GT analytics]] to identify his weakest subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Whenever he hit a plateau in scores, he would focus on studying these bottom 2-5 subjects for the next 10-15 days, which consistently led to score improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Less Utilized Features:

*   **Custom Modules**: He used fewer than five [[utilizing_test_resources_like_marrows_custom_module_for_medical_exams | Maro's custom module]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos/Marathons**: He did not have time to use [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | Maro videos and Q Bank]]'s revision videos or marathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

Dr. Jasurya emphasizes several points for successful exam preparation:

*   **Stick to One Resource**: Doing one resource like [[marrow_as_a_primary_study_resource | Maro]] properly multiple times yields more results than using multiple resources half-heartedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Mental Strength**: Stay mentally strong and don't be swayed by what others are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Regular GTs**: Be very regular with GTs as they are a "game changer" by providing an objective measure of preparation and identifying weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

His journey highlights that consistent and focused [[impact_of_platform_resources_like_maro_on_exam_success | utilization of educational resources like Maro]] can lead to outstanding results, even with initial breaks or non-linear growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

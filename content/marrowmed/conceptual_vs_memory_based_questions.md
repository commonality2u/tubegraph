## Exam Analysis: NEET PG 2024 Surgery

The NEET PG 2024 surgery recall revealed an increased focus on systemic surgery and [[importance_of_conceptbased_learning | conceptual questions]] in both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This marks a shift from previous exams, which typically had fewer Urology questions, but this time, especially Session One, featured many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Trauma and general surgery questions were less prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Session One was generally considered easier, while Session Two presented lengthier questions, more intricate options, and a greater number of images, making it more challenging for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Despite the difficulty variations, the topics were matched across sessions; for example, if one session had a question on V dressing, the other had a different type of question on the same topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways on Question Type

The most significant insight from the NEET PG 2024 surgery paper was the clear emphasis on [[importance_of_conceptbased_learning | conceptual understanding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

> "The questions were all conceptual; they couldn't have been done say 5 days before. You could just randomly can't read 100 facts and then you can answer these surgery questions. You need to understand the concepts or shortcuts wouldn't have helped in this kind of a surgery paper." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>

There were hardly any memory-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. Many questions provided extensive keywords and clues within the stem itself, allowing students to deduce answers even without a clear image, highlighting the importance of comprehending the underlying principles rather than just memorizing facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Advice for Future Preparation

The exam clearly demonstrated that there are "no shortcuts to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>. For future aspirants, the advice is to:

*   **Develop Strong Concepts**: Focus on [[importance_of_conceptbased_learning | building a solid conceptual foundation]], especially in clinical subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Main Videos**: Initially, watch main subject videos to establish concepts rather than rushing to revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid Early Selectivity**: Do not be overly selective with information upfront. It's better to absorb more knowledge like a sponge and then filter it closer to the exam, as attempting to remember little information 100% is often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

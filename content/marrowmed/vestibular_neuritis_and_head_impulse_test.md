## Vestibular Neuritis

Vestibular neuritis is defined as an acute inflammation of the vestibular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This condition leads to the vestibular nerve not properly conducting impulses from the vestibular system of the affected side to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Consequently, it presents as a hypoactive lesion of the affected labyrinth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with acute, sudden onset vertigo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This vertigo is continuous and lasts for at least three to seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. A key distinguishing feature is that hearing remains absolutely normal, as the inflammation is specifically of the vestibular nerve and does not affect the cochlear nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Nystagmus Characteristics
Patients with vestibular neuritis exhibit spontaneous nystagmus, which displays all the features of peripheral involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
The direction of the nystagmus is always towards the more active side, which is typically the normal side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, in left vestibular neuritis, the left labyrinth becomes hypoactive, making the right side more active, thus the nystagmus will be directed towards the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The direction of nystagmus refers to its fast component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Differentiating Vertigo
When a patient presents with vertigo, the primary approach is to determine if it's a peripheral or a central lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This differentiation can often be made by observing the nystagmus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. [[Differential diagnosis of vertigo]] often involves specific vestibular function tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Head Impulse Test

The head impulse test (HIT) is a crucial [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome | vestibular function test]] used to assess the function of the vestibular system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The vestibular system's normal function is to sense head movement and immediately send impulses to the eyes to coordinate eye movement with head movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This coordination ensures that vision remains clear on a desired object regardless of head movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### How it Works
In a healthy vestibular system, if the head is suddenly turned to the right, the eyes will immediately move at an equally fast pace in the opposite direction, remaining fixed on the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Positive Head Impulse Test (Abnormal Response)
If the vestibular system on one side is not functioning properly (e.g., in vestibular neuritis), when the head is suddenly turned towards the affected side, the eyes will move in the opposite direction but will lag behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. To catch up to the target, the eyes will make quick, corrective movements called saccades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Clinical Utility
The Head Impulse Test is a very important and commonly asked test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   It is an easy, outpatient procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   It can test each labyrinth separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   It can also test each semicircular canal separately by performing swift head movements in the plane of the specific semicircular canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   Unlike caloric tests, which can be disturbing for the patient and involve hot/cold water, the HIT is simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

> [!example] Case Example
> A patient with left-sided vestibular neuritis will have a positive head impulse test when the head is rotated to the left. This indicates that right saccades (corrective eye movements to the right) will be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

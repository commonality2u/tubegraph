Homocystinuria is a group of `[[metabolic_disorders_and_enzymes | metabolic disorders]]` that fall under `[[metabolic_disorders_in_biochemistry_for_neet_pg_exam | metabolic disorders in biochemistry]]`, which are high-yielding topics for exams like NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. These conditions involve `[[enzyme_deficiencies and their biochemical implications | enzyme deficiencies]]` in the metabolism of methionine and cysteine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Methionine and Cystine Metabolic Pathways

Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine, then to S-adenosylhomocysteine, and subsequently to homocysteine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Homocysteine has two primary metabolic fates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:

1.  **Transsulfuration Pathway:** Homocysteine combines with serine to form cystathionine, which is then converted to cysteine and homoserine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   The key enzyme for this step is **Cystathionine beta synthase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   This enzyme requires **Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)** as a cofactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Remethylation Pathway:** Homocysteine can be remethylated back to methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   The methyl donor for this process is N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (N5-methyl THF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   N5-methyl THF donates its methyl group to Vitamin B12, forming methyl B12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
    *   Methyl B12 then donates the methyl group to homocysteine, regenerating methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Types of Homocystinuria

Homocystinuria is broadly categorized into two types based on the specific enzyme deficiency and associated biochemical profiles:

#### 1. Classic Homocystinuria

*   **Cause:** Deficiency in the enzyme **Cystathionine beta synthase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Biochemical Implications:**
    *   Cystine level is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   Methionine level remains normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   Megaloblastic anemia is **not** seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Clinical Features:** Patients often present with ectopia lentis (displaced lens) and `hypo` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Supplementation with `cystine` is necessary due to its reduced levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   High doses of **Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)** are given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Pyridoxine helps by increasing cystathionine beta synthase activity, thereby reducing homocysteine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

#### 2. Non-Classic Homocystinuria

This type involves defects in the remethylation pathway, leading to different biochemical and clinical presentations. In non-classic homocystinuria, methionine levels are low because homocysteine cannot be converted back to methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, while cystine levels remain normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

There are two main causes for non-classic homocystinuria:

*   **Defect in N5-methyl THF formation:**
    *   **Cause:** Deficiency of **Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Feature:** Megaloblastic anemia is **not** seen in this condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   **Treatment:** `Methionine supplementation` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, along with a combination of `Vitamin B12`, `Vitamin B6`, and `folic acid` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Defect in Methyl B12 formation:**
    *   **Cause:** Deficiency in the formation of methyl B12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Feature:** Megaloblastic anemia is typically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   **Treatment:** High dose of `hydroxycobalamin (Vitamin B12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>, along with `methionine supplementation` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

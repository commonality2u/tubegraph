[[sexually_transmitted_infections_and_urethritis | Sexually Transmitted Infections]] (STIs) are a significant topic in dermatology, often appearing in medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The exam of INICT May 2025 included multiple questions from infections and [[sexually_transmitted_infections_and_urethritis | sexually transmitted infections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Syphilis (Secondary Stage)

A 30-year-old man presented with high-risk sexual behavior history, lesions on his palms and soles, and a transient genital lesion one month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This clinical picture points to a [[sexually_transmitted_infections_and_urethritis | sexually transmitted infection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
*   **Primary Genital Lesion**: A transient genital lesion approximately one month prior may indicate a primary chancre, which is typically a painless, indurated ulcer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Secondary Syphilis Manifestations**: Four to ten weeks after the primary chancre, the patient may progress to secondary syphilis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This stage involves hematogenous dissemination of *Treponema pallidum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Rash**: A very characteristic asymptomatic, coppery-brown maculopapular rash, notably involving the palms and soles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **Alopecia**: Patchy, non-scarring alopecia, also known as "motheaten pattern" or "motheaten alopecia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Serology**: The most appropriate test for secondary syphilis is serology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   Tests include VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Gonococcal Urethritis

A 26-year-old male presented with pus at the urethral meatus and dysuria (painful urination), following unprotected heterosexual activity one week prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Urine analysis showed plenty of pus cells, and culture indicated penicillin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Gram stain revealed Gram-negative intracellular diplococci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Clinical Findings**: Purulent discharge at the urethral meatus with dysuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Gram Stain**: Gram-negative intracellular diplococci confirm gonococcal urethritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Culture Medium**: For diagnosing gonococcal urethritis, modified Thayer-Martin medium is used for culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Management
*   **First-Line Treatment**: For uncomplicated gonococcal infections involving the cervix, urethra, or rectum, the first-line treatment is injection Ceftriaxone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Dosage**:
        *   500 mg IM single dose for patients weighing less than 150 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
        *   1 g IM single dose for patients weighing 150 kg or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Chlamydia Co-treatment**: If [[sexually_transmitted_infections_and_urethritis | Chlamydia]] infection is not excluded, Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days should always be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Cephalosporin Allergy**: In cases of allergy to cephalosporins, the treatment regimen is injection Gentamicin 240 mg IM plus tablet Azithromycin 2 grams orally in a single dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Ceftriaxone Unavailable**: If Ceftriaxone is unavailable, the third-generation cephalosporin Cefixime can be used at 800 mg orally in a single dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Note that the dosage for Cefixime has changed from 400 mg to 800 mg according to NACO kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Genital Herpes

A young male presented with painful vesicular lesions over the genitalia with superficial erosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
*   **Primary Lesions**: Genital herpes typically presents with painful vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Diagnosis
*   **Histopathology/Tzanck Smear**: Key findings include:
    *   **Multinucleated Giant Cells**: Caused by cell-to-cell fusion triggered by the HSV virus (syncytia formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **Acantholytic Cells (Tzanck Cells)**: Result from the disruption of desmosomal junctions after keratinocytes are infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Management

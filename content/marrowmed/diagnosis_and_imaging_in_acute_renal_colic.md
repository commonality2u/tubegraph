Acute renal colic is a clinical condition characterized by sharp, often severe pain, typically caused by the passage of a [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | renal stone]] or calculus through the ureter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Patients with acute renal colic usually present with acute lumbar region pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This pain characteristically radiates from the loin to the groin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Additional symptoms may include burning sensation or frequent micturition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The combination of these symptoms strongly suggests a suspected diagnosis of acute renal colic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Imaging Modalities

### Initial Investigation: USG
The initial and most commonly performed investigation for suspected acute renal colic is ultrasonography (USG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. USG is readily available, can be performed quickly, and is the [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice]] for detecting hydronephrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

**USG Findings:**
*   A calculus typically appears as a hyperechoic focus with a dense posterior shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Non-obstructive renal calculus:** If there is no associated hydronephrosis, the calculus is considered non-obstructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Obstructive calculus:** If a calculus dislodges and impacts the ureter, it can cause obstruction, leading to a dilated pelvicalyceal system and ureter, known as hydronephrosis and hydro-ureter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Alternative / Older Investigation: X-ray KUB
In cases where USG is not available or as a historical approach, an X-ray KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) might be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, X-ray KUB has poor sensitivity for detecting calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

**X-ray KUB Findings:**
*   A [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | renal calculus]] may be directly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   A ureteric calculus would appear along the course of the ureter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Staghorn Calculus:** A specific appearance is a cast-like structure filling the entire [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | renal pelvic system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These are typically triple phosphate or struvite calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Investigation of Choice: Non-contrast CT
The best diagnostic investigation and the [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice]] for renal or ureteric calculi is a non-contrast CT scan of the Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder (CT KUB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Contrast is generally not required for the detection of calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

**Non-contrast CT Findings:**
*   [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | Renal calculus]] visible within the renal pelvis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Jackstone Calculus:** A calculus within the urinary bladder can take a peculiar shape known as a jackstone calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Soft Tissue Rim Sign:** A ureteric calculus impacted within the ureter may show an edematous ureteric wall surrounding it on all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This appears as a calculus at the center with a soft tissue rim around it, known as the soft tissue rim sign of a ureteric calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Clinchers Related to Urolithiasis
*   **Most Common Calculus:** Usually calcium oxalate calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Hardest Calculus:** Usually cysteine calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These cannot be treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) because they are too hard to fragment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Radiolucent Calculi (not seen on X-rays):**
    *   Pure uric acid calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Certain medication calculi (e.g., indinavir calculi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   Pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   **CT Occult Calculi (not seen even on CT scan):** Indinavir calculi and pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Management and Complications of Renal Calculi
The [[radiological_signs_and_treatment_of_renal_calculi | treatment of renal calculi]] can involve various interventions:
*   **Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube (PCN):** A tube passed percutaneously into the kidney to drain urine and establish output, especially for large calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL):** Used to fragment large calculi into smaller pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Double J (DJ) Stent:** Placed after fragmentation to help smaller fragments pass without impaction and drain urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It has one J-loop in the renal pelvis and one in the bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Steinstrasse Appearance:** Small calculus fragments lining up along the double J stent or ureter, resembling a "stone street" (German for "Steinstra√üe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Complications of Obstructive Uropathy
*   **Acute Pyelonephritis:** An inflamed or infected kidney secondary to calculus disease. Presents with fever, elevated WBC count, and p-cells in urine. On CT, the kidney is enlarged with heterogeneous enhancement and perinephric fat stranding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Emphysematous Pyelonephritis:** A severe renal infection, typically in diabetics or immunocompromised patients, caused by air-forming microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. CT shows extensive dirty black mottling within the renal parenchyma due to interspersed air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis:** Occurs due to chronic [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | renal calculus]] disease with superimposed infection (often *Proteus* or *E. coli*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Imaging shows a central dense calculus and multiple round collections in the renal parenchyma, resembling a "bear paw" sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

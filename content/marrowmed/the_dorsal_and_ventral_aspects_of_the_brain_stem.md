The [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] is a crucial part of the central nervous system, and understanding its various surfaces helps in localizing [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] and identifying key anatomical features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article details the ventral and dorsal aspects of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]], including the points of emergence of different [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] and significant internal structures.

## Ventral Aspect of the Brain Stem

The ventral surface of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] provides a view of how [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves are emerging out]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Midbrain

The most superior part of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]]'s ventral aspect is the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | midbrain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **[[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | Cerebral Peduncle]]** (Crus Cerebri): This area is part of the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | midbrain]], specifically its ventral portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It contains descending tracts from the cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   **Third Cranial Nerve (Oculomotor)**: The only nerve emerging from the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | cerebral peduncle]], specifically from the interpeduncular fossa between the two peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Interpeduncular Fossa**: The space between the two [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | cerebral peduncles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   **Structures within**: Mammillary bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> and the infundibulum of the pituitary gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   **Third Cranial Nerve**: Emerges from this fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear)**: While seen from the ventral aspect, it is unique as it is the *only* [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] that emerges from the dorsal aspect of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> and is the thinnest [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Pons

The pons is the middle part of the ventral [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Fifth Cranial Nerve (Trigeminal)**: The only nerve emerging from the ventral surface of the pons, located laterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is a mixed nerve with a thicker sensory part and a thinner motor part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Medulla Oblongata

The medulla oblongata is the most inferior part of the ventral [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Key Ventral Features**:
    *   **Olive**: An elevation due to the inferior olivary nucleus inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   **Pyramid**: An elevation where the corticospinal tract passes through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These two elevations help identify the medulla oblongata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Cranial Nerves Emerging from the Pons-Medulla Junction (Ponto-medullary Junction)**:
    *   **Sixth Cranial Nerve (Abducens)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Seventh Cranial Nerve (Facial)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   **Eighth Cranial Nerve (Vestibulocochlear)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Cranial Nerves Emerging Lateral/Posterolateral to the Olive**:
    *   **Ninth Cranial Nerve (Glossopharyngeal)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   **Tenth Cranial Nerve (Vagus)**: Often seen along with the cranial accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Eleventh Cranial Nerve (Accessory)**: Includes cranial and spinal components, with the spinal part coming from the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Cranial Nerve Emerging Between the Pyramid and Olive**:
    *   **Twelfth Cranial Nerve (Hypoglossal)**: Emerges as multiple rootlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Clinical Relevance (Ventral Aspect)

Identifying [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] on the ventral aspect of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] is critical for diagnosing clinical conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For example, injury to the third nerve (interpeduncular fossa) can lead to ipsilateral ptosis or divergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, while injury to the sixth nerve (pontomedullary junction) can cause convergence squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Dorsal Aspect of the Brain Stem

The dorsal aspect of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] reveals the floor of the fourth ventricle, which is exposed when the cerebellum is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This floor is also known as the rhomboid fossa due to its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Midbrain (Dorsal)

The dorsal [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | midbrain]] features prominent colliculi:
*   **Superior Colliculus**: Part of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | visual pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and connected to the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | lateral geniculate body]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Inferior Colliculus**: A component of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> and connected to the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | medial geniculate body]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Corpora Quadrigemina**: The collective term for the four colliculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Geniculate Bodies**: Located behind the thalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   **Medial Geniculate Body**: Associated with the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   **Lateral Geniculate Body**: Associated with the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | visual pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear)**: The only [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] emerging from the dorsal aspect of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Fourth Ventricle

The boundaries of the fourth ventricle are formed by the cerebellar peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Superior Cerebellar Peduncle**: Converges downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle**: Converges upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Middle Cerebellar Peduncle**: Belongs to the pons but does not contribute to the boundary of the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

#### Floor of the Fourth Ventricle (Rhomboid Fossa)

The floor of the fourth ventricle contains several important structures:
*   **Midline Sulcus**: A central groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Sulcus Limitans**: An embryologically important sulcus lateral to the midline sulcus, which divides the neural tube into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   **Medial to Sulcus Limitans**: This area, known as the basal plate, contains motor nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
        *   **Facial Colliculus**: The most prominent elevation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. It contains the sixth (abducent) nucleus deep to it, which is surrounded by the facial nerve fibers, causing the bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
        *   **Hypoglossal Triangle**: An elevation below the facial colliculus, deep to which the hypoglossal nucleus is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
        *   **Vagal Triangle**: Located further below, containing the dorsal nucleus of the vagus (vagal nucleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   **Lateral to Sulcus Limitans**: This area, known as the alar plate, is primarily a sensory area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
        *   **Vestibular Triangle**: Located laterally, containing the vestibular nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Cranial Nerve Nuclei in the Floor of the Fourth Ventricle

The nuclei of the following [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] are present in the floor of the fourth ventricle:
*   Sixth (Abducent) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
*   Eighth (Vestibulocochlear) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
*   Tenth (Vagus) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>
*   Twelfth (Hypoglossal) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>

### Clinical Considerations (Dorsal Aspect)

When considering injury to the facial colliculus, the **seventh (facial) nerve** is the better answer for affected structures, rather than the sixth nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This is because the facial nerve fibers surround the sixth nucleus, and therefore, an injury or pressure on the facial colliculus would primarily affect the facial nerve, leading to [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve]] and paralysis of [[speech_areas_and_function_in_the_brain | muscles of facial expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While the sixth nucleus is deep to it, the facial nerve itself is the first structure to be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Endemic atypical pneumonia is caused by five specific [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]]: *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, *Paracoccidioides*, and *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These fungi are all [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]], meaning they exist in both yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

All five fungi typically manifest as pneumonia with symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, notably without consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The standard treatment for all is consistent: itraconazole for mild to moderate cases and liposomal amphotericin B for severe cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The primary method of differentiation among these pathogens is through laboratory diagnosis, by identifying their distinct yeast and mold forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Histoplasma (Histoplasmosis)

*   **Synonyms**: Darling's Disease, Ohio Valley Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Characterized by intracellular yeast cells, commonly found within macrophages. *Histoplasma* is the only intracellular fungus among these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Identified by tuberculate conidia, which are conidia surrounded by tubercles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Blastomyces (Blastomycosis)

*   **Synonyms**: Gilchrist's Disease, North American Blastomycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Distinguished by broad-based budding yeast cells, often described as having a "figure of eight" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Displays pear-shaped conidia found along the hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Coccidioides (Coccidioidomycosis)

*   **Synonyms**: Valley Fever, California Valley Fever, Desert Rheumatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Presents as spherules containing endospores inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Characterized by arthroconidia with fragmented hyphae. These are rectangular-shaped conidia present within the hyphae, making them appear fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Paracoccidioides (Paracoccidioidomycosis)

*   **Synonyms**: South American Blastomycosis (due to its mold form resembling *Blastomyces* and its prevalence in South America) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Features yeast cells with multiple projections, giving a distinctive "Mickey Mouse ears" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Shows pear-shaped conidia, similar to *Blastomyces* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Talaromyces marneffei (Talaromycosis)

*   **Synonyms**: Penicilliosis (due to its alternative name *Penicillium marneffei*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This fungus produces a [[microbial_phenomena_and_tests | red pigment on SDA]] (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Yeast Form**: Unique for its oval-shaped yeast cells with a septum in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Mold Form**: Exhibits a "bottle brush appearance," where chains of conidia are produced from phialides on conidiophores, resembling a bottle brush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

These distinct morphological characteristics in their yeast and mold forms are crucial for the laboratory diagnosis and identification of these endemic [[dimorphic_fungi_and_their_forms | dimorphic fungi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

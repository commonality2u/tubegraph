Dr. Somya Aditya's journey to achieving an INIC rank two demonstrates remarkable persistence and the effective strategies employed to overcome challenges in competitive medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## Parental Support and Foundational Philosophy
Dr. Somya's parents played a crucial role in his success, describing his achievement as a "dream come true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. His mother expressed immense happiness and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, considering herself lucky to have him as a son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Dr. Somya himself attributes his success significantly to the tireless work and sacrifices of his parents, who supported him and arranged everything for his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His father emphasized the importance of having a philosophy in life beyond just pursuing a career, stating that a person needs a guiding philosophy to achieve their path's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This strong [[family_support_in_academic_success | family support]] and emphasis on core values contributed to his development as a "good human being" and a "devoted son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Early Preparation and Consistent Efforts
Dr. Somya began his INIC preparation early, subscribing to Marrow from his third year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. He utilized the printed notes, marking them and adding extra points from videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. He completed major final year subjects like Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, and ENT in his third year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. By mid-internship, he had completed his first full cycle of all 19 subjects, including first and second-year subjects, primarily through main videos for selective topics and revision notes/QBank for the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## [[dealing_with_setbacks_and_maintaining_motivation | Dealing with Setbacks and Maintaining Momentum]]
Dr. Somya's journey to rank two was not his first attempt. In May 2024, he secured an INIC rank of 76 and a NEET PG rank of 157 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Despite these good ranks, he decided to attempt again because he was not securing his desired branch and college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He viewed the November attempt as his "last attempt," determining that he had to give his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This unwavering determination, even after achieving high ranks, distinguished him from many students who might stop once they reach a satisfactory score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. He stressed that "consistency matters," proving that continuous effort leads to the desired destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Adapting to Evolving Content
A significant [[overcoming_challenges_and_improving_performance_in_competitive_exams | challenge]] for many students is dealing with new editions and updates in study materials. Dr. Somya accepted this as a part of the medical field, stating that "we cannot stick on to only the history and we have to move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He diligently added new points from Marrow's Edition 6 to his Edition 5 notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Strategic Practice and Revision
Dr. Somya employed a systematic approach to practice and revision:
*   **QBank Completion**: He completed the entire QBank before his May exam and prior to starting Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. He realized the importance of multiple revisions of the QBank, focusing on mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Bookmark Usage**: He extensively bookmarked questions, using different marks for star and question mark questions to suit his study pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He revisited these bookmarked questions during subsequent revision cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Revision Cycles**: He completed two to three cycles for main subjects and about two cycles for shorter subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. For clinical subjects, he always revised the main video notes, brushing through all topics quickly, finding more confidence in them than revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **McQ Discussion Videos and Marrow Pearls**: He used MCQ discussion videos as an interactive, relaxing test by pausing and answering questions before watching explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Marrow Pearls, with their related MCQs, helped him gain a strong grasp of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: The most helpful feature for him was the previous year questions in the QBank, which he found authentic with clear explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. He revised all 19 subjects' PYQs from the QBank two to three weeks before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## GT Performance and Mindset
Dr. Somya started giving GTs from mid-internship after completing one revision cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Initially, his ranks were good (50-60), but they later dipped (400-500) as more subscribers joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Instead of being disheartened, he used this as a signal to intensify his preparation, embarking on another revision cycle, focusing particularly on his weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. He made it a point to take GTs live to avoid creating a liability later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. When his rank in the INIC mock test was 47, he consciously detached his emotions, choosing to focus solely on his preparation rather than the rank itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## [[balancing_academics_and_personal_life_in_medicine | Balancing Internship and Studies]]
Internship was a hectic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, but Dr. Somya managed by dedicating small windows of time before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. He utilized the relatively free days during lighter department postings (e.g., short subjects) to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. He found that studying during internship allowed him to relate theoretical knowledge from videos to practical ward experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

## Key Advice
Dr. Somya advises students to:
*   **Continue Hard Work**: Emphasizing that consistent hard work will pay off in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Preparation**: The exam isn't just about the last few months of study but "what you have done through entire MBBS and life and the internship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Clinical Experience**: Many questions in the INIC exam came directly from ward experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Attending clinical rounds and gaining experience with patients during undergraduate years and internship is crucial and irreplaceable by videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. Interns should view their time as gaining valuable experience rather than a disadvantage due to less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

## Complications Related to Surgery and Postoperative Care

This article provides an overview of various complications that can arise during and after surgical procedures, along with best practices for prevention and management, drawing from discussions on surgical safety, patient monitoring, and wound care.

### Pre-operative Prevention and Patient Safety

Effective pre-operative planning and patient preparation are crucial to minimize post-surgical complications.
*   **Pre-operative Practices:**
    *   Improving nutrient intake for two weeks before surgery can significantly improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
    *   Smoking cessation is most beneficial if done for at least 6 to 8 weeks prior to surgery; 4 weeks alone is not sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
    *   Bathing with an antiseptic soap solution before surgery helps reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
    *   Chronic anemia is better tolerated than acute blood loss before surgery, as the body adapts to lower hemoglobin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **[[surgical_safety_checklist_and_procedures | Surgical Safety Checklist]]:** This checklist is divided into three phases to ensure patient safety and prevent errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>:
    *   **Sign-in:** Occurs before anesthesia induction, verifying patient identity, consent, site marking, and checking for allergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Time-out:** Performed before skin incision, reconfirming patient details, surgical plan, and discussing antibiotic prophylaxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Sign-out:** Completed before the patient leaves the operating room, involving instrument and gauze counts, specimen labeling, and blood loss assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Counting mops and equipment during this phase can prevent retained surgical items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Hand Hygiene:** Adhering to the five moments of hand hygiene prescribed by WHO is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>:
    *   Before touching a patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
    *   After touching a patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
    *   Before a procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   After exposure to body fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   After touching the patient's surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   Hand sanitizer can be used in most situations, but soap and water are mandatory when hands are visibly soiled or after using the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Patient Safety Events:**
    *   **Near Miss Event:** When an error occurs but harm is prevented due to timely intervention, such as stopping an IV bolus of potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. IV potassium cannot be given as a bolus due to the risk of arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Adverse Event:** When harm occurs to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **No Harm Event:** When an event occurs that should not have, but results in no harm to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Intra-operative Considerations

*   **[[understanding_of_anesthetic_drugs_and_complications | Anesthetic Agents]] and Positioning:**
    *   Minimally invasive techniques are preferred during surgery to facilitate faster recovery and reduce pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   Long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
    *   Patient body temperature should be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   For laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient is placed in a reverse Trendelenburg and right-up position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. CO2 retention beneath the right dome of the diaphragm can lead to referred pain to the right shoulder tip, a common post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy complication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Trendelenburg position (foot end raised, head end low) is used for pelvic surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   Lithotomy position (gynecological/pelvic procedures) carries a risk of common peroneal nerve injury if legs are not properly supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   Fowler's position (sitting position) for CNS surgery offers better exposure and less bleeding but increases the risk of air embolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Any surgical position with the head end raised can increase this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Cautery Usage:**
    *   **Monopolar Cautery:** Pencil-like, capable of both cutting and coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. It can cause thermal damage to vital nerves and interfere with cardiac pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
    *   **Bipolar Cautery:** Prong-like, used only for coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Safer near vital nerves and in patients with cardiac pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
    *   **Cutting Mode:** Continuous low voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   **Coagulation Mode:** Alternating current, high voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Post-operative Care and Complications

*   **[[enhanced_recovery_after_surgery_protocols | Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)]] Protocols:** These protocols are a group of measures implemented before, during, and after surgery to ensure faster patient recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Pre-operative:** Counseling, avoiding mechanical bowel prep (worsens fluid/electrolyte imbalance), solids up to 6 hours pre-op, clear liquids up to 2 hours pre-op <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **Intra-operative:** Minimally invasive techniques, long-acting local anesthetics, maintaining patient warmth, maintenance IV fluids, two classes of antiemetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Post-operative:** Use of NSAIDs (opioids for breakthrough pain only), regular diet, discontinuing IV fluids within 24 hours, early ambulation within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. ERAS protocols recommend inserting fewer drains to facilitate earlier discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Surgical Site Infection (SSI):** SSI rates vary based on wound classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>:
    *   **Clean Wounds:** No entry into GI/GU/respiratory tracts (e.g., thyroid or breast surgery). Risk: 1-2% with or without antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
    *   **Clean-Contaminated Wounds:** Entry into GI/GU system without inflammation (e.g., elective cholecystectomy, appendectomy, C-section, abdominal hysterectomy, prepared bowel surgery). Risk: 3% with antibiotic prophylaxis, 6-9% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
    *   **Contaminated Wounds:** Entry into GI/GI system with non-purulent inflammation (e.g., emergency cholecystectomy, appendectomy, unprepared bowel surgery). Risk: 6% with antibiotics, 20% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
    *   **Dirty Wounds:** Pus present or fecal contamination (e.g., all abscesses). Risk: 7-8% with antibiotics, 20-40% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   **Wound Healing and Assessment:**
    *   **Southampton Wound Score:** A scoring system for wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>:
        *   Grade 0: Normal healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
        *   Grade 1: Normal healing with mild bruising or erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
        *   Grade 2: Erythema plus other signs of inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
        *   Grade 3: Clear discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
        *   Grade 4: Purulent discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
        *   Grade 5: Complete breakdown of tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   **ASEPSIS Wound Score:** Another scoring system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>:
        *   A: Additional treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
        *   S: Serous discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>
        *   E: Erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>
        *   P: Purulent discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>
        *   S: Separation of deep tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>
        *   I: Isolation of bacteria from the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>
        *   S: Prolonged stay beyond 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>
    *   **Wound Healing by Intention:**
        *   **Primary Intention:** Suture the wound for a good scar and minimal granulation tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
        *   **Secondary Intention:** Leave the wound open; increased granulation and gradual shrinking, leading to a longer healing period and potential hypertrophic scars or keloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
        *   **Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure):** Wound is initially left open (e.g., in contaminated cases) and then sutured after the infection is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
    *   **Suturing Techniques:**
        *   **Horizontal Mattress Suture:** Used when simple sutures fail to cause eversion; provides hemostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
        *   **Subcuticular Suturing:** Cosmetically superior, typically uses Monocryl on a cutting or reverse cutting needle for tough structures like skin, sheath, and fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
    *   **Scars:**
        *   **Keloid:** Grows beyond the boundary of the original scar and does not settle with time or pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Common sites include the sternum, shoulder, and earlobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Management involves intralesional steroid injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
        *   **Hypertrophic Scar:** Remains within the scar boundary and may settle with time and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

### Specific Post-operative Complications

*   **Burst Abdomen (Abdominal Wound Dehiscence):**
    *   Usually presents around the sixth post-operative day with a reddish "salmon fluid sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
    *   More common with midline incisions than transverse incisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   Incidence increases if suture length is less than four times the wound length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
    *   Definitive management involves re-suturing the rectus sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

*   **Hemorrhage:**
    *   **Primary Hemorrhage:** Occurs during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
    *   **Reactionary Hemorrhage:** Occurs within 24 hours post-surgery due to slippage of a knot or dislodgement of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.
    *   **Secondary Hemorrhage:** Occurs after 7 to 14 days, typically due to sloughing of a vessel wall caused by infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Shock:**
    *   **Q-SOFA Score:** A quick assessment for organ failure, including hypotension (systolic BP < 100 mmHg), altered mental status, and tachypnea (>22 breaths/min) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.

    *   **Septic Shock:** Sepsis with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg and serum lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
    *   **MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome):** Failure of two or more organ systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
    *   **Types of Shock and Characteristics:**
        *   **Hypovolemic Shock:** Low cardiac output, low central venous pressure (JVP), high vascular resistance (cold extremities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
        *   **Distributive Shock (e.g., Septic, Neurogenic):** Low vascular resistance (warm extremities) due to vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. In septic shock, mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVOS) is high because tissues cannot properly utilize oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

*   **VAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) Dressing / Negative Pressure Wound Therapy:**
    *   Used for non-healing wounds, venous ulcers (debrided, no slough), burns without eschar, bed sores after debridement, and diabetic ulcers without osteomyelitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
    *   Exerts a negative pressure, typically -110 to -130 mmHg (normally -120 to -125 mmHg), which increases blood flow to the wound and hastens healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   **Bed Sores / Pressure Sores:**
    *   **Most Common Sites:** Ischium, followed by greater trochanter, then sacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   Caused by constant pressure >30 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
    *   **Staging (Latest):**
        *   Stage 1: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin (red/maroon, remains red under pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
        *   Stage 2: Partial thickness skin loss with exposed dermis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
        *   Stage 3: Full thickness skin loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
        *   Stage 4: Full thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Grade 1: Offloading pressure (e.g., water mattress, changing patient position every 2 hours), ensuring adequate nutrition, keeping tissue dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
        *   Grade 2 & 3: Debridement and VAC dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
        *   Grade 4: Debridement and often requires flap cover due to large tissue loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Burn Injury Treatment:** For Grade 3 and Grade 4 burns, the best treatment is debridement and split-thickness skin grafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

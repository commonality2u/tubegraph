From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The November 2024 INICET session included a recall session for anaesthesia questions. The faculty noted that the anaesthesia paper contained some routine questions, with most being straightforward, one slightly tricky question, and one "clear-cut bouncer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. The discussion specifically covered questions exclusive to the anaesthesia segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Overview of Questions Asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>

Anaesthesia typically features five or six questions in examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Key areas to focus on for future exams include airway management, basic and advanced cardiac life support, and pharmacology, especially local anaesthetics and IV induction agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Recalled Questions and Concepts

### 1. Jackson Rees Circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>

*   **Question**: Jackson Rees circuit is used for what? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>
*   **Correct Answer**: Pediatric anaesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

The Jackson Rees circuit is also known as the Ayre's T-piece (Ayre's T-piece, IR TPS) or Mapleson F circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. It is the circuit of choice for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Circuit questions have been relatively uncommon in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

#### Breathing Systems Classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>

Breathing systems are classified into three main categories:

1.  **Open Circuit**:
    *   Examples include the Schimmelbusch mask, where ether or chloroform is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
    *   Not commonly used nowadays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Semi-Closed Circuits (Mapleson's Circuits)**: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>
    *   Divided into six categories: Mapleson A, B, C, D, E, and F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Mapleson A**: Known as the Magill circuit, it is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
        *   Modification: Lack circuit (coaxial circuit with inner tubing carrying expiratory gases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
        *   Fresh gas flow should be equal to minute ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Mapleson B and C**: Obsolete and not commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Mapleson D**: Circuit of choice for controlled ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
        *   Modification: Bain circuit (coaxial circuit with inner tubing carrying oxygen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
        *   Fresh gas flow should be 1.6 times minute ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Mapleson E**: Called Ayre's T-piece (IR TPS), forms the basis for ventilator construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Mapleson F**: Known as Jackson Rees modification of the E circuit, circuit of choice for children or pediatrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
    *   APL valve position: Close to patient end in B and C circuits, away from patient end in D circuit, and absent in E and F circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Closed Circuit**:
    *   Has a provision to absorb carbon dioxide using soda lime (calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
    *   Advantage: Allows reduced fresh gas flows, making it economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
    *   Disadvantage: Bulky, prone to disconnections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
    *   Generally used for long-duration procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### 2. Rib Fracture Pain Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>

*   **Question**: A female road traffic accident patient has fractured third to fifth ribs, with pain unresponsive to routine analgesics. Which block should be given? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>
*   **Correct Answer**: Thoracic epidural anaesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

Rib fractures are painful, especially with deep breaths, and cannot be immobilized like other fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

#### Pain Management Options:

*   **Intercostal Nerve Block**: Standard treatment for rib fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
    *   Advantage: Reduces opioid dosage, thus avoiding respiratory depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
    *   Disadvantage: High possibility of [[Anesthesia recall for NEETPG 2024 | Local Anesthesia Systemic Toxicity]] (LAST) due to maximum systemic absorption of local anaesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   Best for one or two rib fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Cervical Plexus Block**: Used for surgeries like carotid endarterectomy, lymph node biopsy, or thyroid surgeries (neck region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Not applicable for rib fractures.
*   **Lumbar Epidural**: Generally used for postoperative analgesia in lower abdominal surgeries or labor analgesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Not applicable for rib fractures.
*   **Supraclavicular (Brachial Plexus Block)**: Used for upper limb surgeries as it supplies the Upper Limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Not applicable for rib fractures.
*   **Thoracic Epidural Anaesthesia**: Ideal for multiple rib fractures (e.g., T1 to T10 or T12) as it provides comprehensive pain management without high systemic absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### 3. Drug Causing Adrenal Suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>

*   **Question**: Which of the following drugs will cause adrenal suppression? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   **Correct Answer**: Etomidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

#### Etomidate Mnemonic: E.T.O.M.I.D.A.T.E. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>

*   **E**: Emesis (vomiting), Epileptogenic (may cause seizures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **O**: Oily (contains propylene glycol), making it painful upon injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. (Propofol is another oily preparation containing soybean oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.)
*   **T**: Tortures the hand (painful injection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **M**: Myoclonus (sudden involuntary jerky movements of the limb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **I**: Inhibits adrenocortical synthesis (the key characteristic causing adrenal suppression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **DATE**: Most cardio stable agent, making it the agent of choice for cardiac surgery and cardioversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

### 4. Incorrect Statement Regarding Thiopentone Sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>

*   **Question**: Which of the following is incorrect regarding Thiopentone Sodium? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
*   **False Statement (and Correct Answer)**: Rapid decline in its effect is due to renal excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

#### Properties of Thiopentone Sodium:

*   Yellow color powder with a pH of 10.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   Highly lipophilic substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   Reaches the brain within 15 seconds (arm-brain circulation time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   Acts on GABA receptors to cause sedation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   The **termination of action** is primarily due to **redistribution** to adipose tissue and muscle, not renal excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
    *   It rapidly moves from the brain to fat deposits, causing the patient to wake up, then redistributes back to the brain, causing re-sedation (this cycle can continue for 10-12 hours after a single dose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   99% of anaesthetic drugs are metabolized in the liver, with eventual renal excretion after hydroxylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### 5. Post Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>

*   **Question**: Which of the following must be avoided in a patient with post Cardiac Arrest resuscitation care? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>
*   **Correct Answer (to be avoided)**: Bring the body temperature below 32Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

This area, particularly post-cardiac resuscitation care and neuro prognostication, has been a star area since the 2020 Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

#### Post-Resuscitation Care Guidelines:

1.  **Stabilize the Patient**:
    *   Secure [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | Advanced Airway]] (endotracheal tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   Connect to ventilator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg to ensure adequate brain blood flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain SpO2 between 92-98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain CO2 levels between 35-45 mmHg, as CO2 influences cerebral perfusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Cardiac Intervention**:
    *   Obtain a 12-lead ECG.
    *   Consider emergency cardiac intervention (e.g., PCI) if the patient develops ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Assess Neurological Status**:
    *   If the patient is comatose, institute **Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)** or **Targeted Therapeutic Hypothermia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
        *   Reduce body temperature to **32-36Â°C** for up to 24 hours (hypothermia is brain-protective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
        *   Avoid fever and temperatures below 32Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
    *   If still unresponsive after 24 hours, slowly rewarm the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
    *   Perform neurological assessments:
        *   MRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
        *   Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
        *   EEG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
        *   Measure Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) levels between 24-72 hours as an indicator of brain damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### 6. Ambu Aura 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>

*   **Question**: Ambu Aura 40 is an example of which type of LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   **Correct Answer**: First-generation LMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

This was considered a "bouncer" question due to its specificity to a company product name without an accompanying image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

#### LMA Generations:

*   There are only first and second-generation LMAs; no third or fourth generation exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Second-Generation LMAs**: Characterized by the presence of a drain tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
    *   Examples: LMA ProSeal, i-gel, LMA Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   Ambu's only second-generation LMA is the Ambu AuraGain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **First-Generation LMAs**: Do not have a drain tube.
    *   Examples: LMA Classic, LMA Fastrach, and Ambu Aura 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
    *   Ambu Aura 40 can be reused up to 40 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Genetics is a frequently covered topic in biochemistry examinations, with approximately three to five questions dedicated to it in the May 2025 INACT recall session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The overall difficulty level of biochemistry questions was moderate to difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Key Genetic Concepts

### Gene Pool
A gene pool refers to the combination of all genes, including all alleles, present in a reproducing population or species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The concept of a gene pool is crucial for guaranteeing [[Genetic testing in familial cancer cases | genetic diversity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Taking alleles from an inbreeding population would result in less [[Genetic testing in familial cancer cases | genetic diversity]] compared to a reproducing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Genetic Disorders and Conditions

### Sphingolipidosis
This group of metabolic disorders often presents with unique features that provide diagnostic clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A key indicator is the presence of a cherry red spot in the macula, which directs attention towards sphingolipidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Cherry Red Spot Present:**
    *   **Visceromegaly Absent:** Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, Krabbe disease (though cherry red spot can be plus/minus in Krabbe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Tay-Sachs specifically involves hexosaminidase A deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Visceromegaly Present:** Niemann-Pick disease or GM1 gangliosidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Niemann-Pick disease is associated with sphingomyelinase deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Cherry Red Spot Absent:** Gaucher disease and Fabry disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Gaucher disease often presents with massive visceromegaly, unlike Fabry disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Gaucher disease is due to glucocerebrosidase deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Glycogen Storage Disorders (GSDs)
These disorders often manifest with liver disease, muscle weakness, and particularly fasting hypoglycemia, along with hepatomegaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

*   **Kori's Disease (GSD Type III):** Characterized by a defective debranching enzyme (alpha-1,4/alpha-1,6 glucan transferase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Features include fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly, often with increased liver enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   **IV Glucagon Challenge:** After a carbohydrate meal, a normal rise in blood glucose is seen in Kori's disease following IV glucagon administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is because the debranching enzyme defect allows for some glucose-1-phosphate release from glycogen by glycogen phosphorylase, which can then be converted to glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This differentiates it from Von Gierke's disease (GSD Type I), where glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency prevents a blood glucose rise even with glucagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency
This deficiency leads to decreased NADPH, which promotes hemolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This results in hemolytic jaundice, where indirect bilirubin is elevated while direct bilirubin remains normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Urine urobilinogen is increased due to excess hemolysis, indicated by a positive Ehrlich's test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### [[Genetic testing in familial_cancer_cases | Familial Cancer Genetic Testing]]
For strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are typically suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. These usually involve point mutations rather than changes in gene length or dosage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### [[Congenital diseases and their diagnostics in pediatrics | Hallervorden-Spatz Syndrome]] (PKAN Deficiency)
This is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to a defect in pantothenate kinase (PKAN) deficiency, which is associated with vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. Clinically, it presents with rigidity, cognitive impairment, chorea, dystonia, and Parkinsonian features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. A characteristic radiological finding is the "eye of the tiger sign" on MRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

## Amino Acid Biochemistry

### Glycine Titration Curve and Isoelectric Point (pI)
The pH at which a compound exists as a zwitterion or ampholyte is its isoelectric point (pI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. For glycine, with PK1 (carboxyl group) at 2.4 and PK2 (amino group) at 9.8, the pI is calculated as the average of these ionization constants: (2.4 + 9.8) / 2 = 6.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. For amino acids with three ionizable groups (e.g., aspartic acid with an extra carboxylic acid group in its side chain), the pI is the average of the ionization constants of the isoionic species, typically the two acidic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Cellular Metabolism and Genetic Implications

### Cancer Cell Glucose Consumption (Warburg Effect)
Cancer cells consume more glucose than normal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This is primarily due to increased lactate production even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. This metabolic shift, called metabolic reprogramming, results in only two ATPs being produced per glucose molecule, leading to higher glucose demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. A key factor is the presence of an isoform of pyruvate kinase called PKM2 in cancer cells, instead of the usual PKM1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

## [[Biomolecular techniques in diagnostics | Genetic and Molecular Diagnostic Methods]]

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The number of DNA amplicons generated after 'n' cycles of PCR is given by the formula 2^n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Therefore, half the copies generated at cycle 'n' would be found at cycle 'n-1' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. For instance, if 26 cycles are performed, half the copies would be generated at 25 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

*   **Quantitative PCR (qPCR) / Real-time PCR:** Used when mutations affecting gene length or dosage are suspected, such as trinucleotide repeat mutations or large gene deletions (e.g., in CFTR gene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR):** Detects RNA levels and is used for gene expression studies, not for DNA mutation detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### DNA-based Techniques
*   **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP):** Identifies differences between DNA strains based on unique restriction sites recognized by restriction enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. If a mutation affects a restriction site, the resulting DNA band pattern will differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Southern Blotting:** A technique based on DNA hybridization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### Sequencing
*   **Sanger Sequencing:** A method for DNA sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** Includes whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
    *   **Whole Genome Sequencing:** Sequences the entire genome, but is very costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
    *   **Whole Exome Sequencing:** A more cost-effective option that sequences only the coding regions (exons) of the genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. It is considered the single best [[Genetic testing in familial cancer cases | genetic test]] for diagnosing conditions like familial breast and ovarian cancer where point mutations are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

### Other Mutation Detection Techniques
*   **Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA):** Used to detect large gene deletions or when gene dosage is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
*   **Amplicon Length Analysis:** Used to assess mutations that affect the length of an amplicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.

### Bacterial Strain Genotyping
These methods are used to identify different mutated strains of the same species, such as *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, by analyzing changes in their DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

*   **Chromosome Mutation Analysis:** A general term for techniques that analyze mutations in bacterial chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Spoligotyping:** Analyzes unique spacer sequences located on either side of direct repeats within the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
*   **Multiple Interspersed Repetitive Unit Typing (MIRU-VNTR):** A more advanced method that directly types variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), offering higher discrimination quality than spoligotyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** Whole genome sequencing can be used for genotyping bacterial strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

### Advanced Diagnostic Techniques
*   **Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR):** This is a real-time, label-free technique used to measure the association and dissociation of molecules, such as antigen-antibody complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. When antigen-antibody complexes form, plasmon waves are produced, allowing for the measurement of a surface plasmon resonance angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. SPR is considered a gold standard method for detecting antibody affinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. Unlike ELISA, SPR does not require labels for detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

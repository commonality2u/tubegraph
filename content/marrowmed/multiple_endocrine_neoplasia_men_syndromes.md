Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes are a group of genetic disorders that cause tumors in two or more endocrine glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## MEN1 (Wermer Syndrome)
[[genetic_testing_in_familial_cancer_cases | MEN1]] syndrome is caused by a mutation in the *MEN* gene located on chromosome 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. It is also known as Wermer syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The syndrome is characterized by the "3 Ps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>:
*   **Pituitary Adenomas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>: The most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is prolactinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Parathyroid Adenomas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>: Parathyroid adenomas are more common than hypoplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. [[understanding_common_conditions_related_to_endocrinology | Parathyroid abnormalities]] are the most common presenting feature of MEN1 syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>: While insulinoma is the most common overall pancreatic endocrine tumor, in MEN1, the most common is gastrinoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## MEN2
[[genetic_testing_in_familial_cancer_cases | MEN2]] is caused by a mutation in the *RET* protooncogene on chromosome 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### MEN2A (Sipple Syndrome)
MEN2A is also known as Sipple syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Its features include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>:
*   Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>
*   Parathyroid Adenoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   Pheochromocytoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>
This subtype is usually associated with an Exon 634 mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### MEN2B (MEN3 Syndrome)
MEN2B is also known as MEN3 syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It is characterized by five "M's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>:
*   Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
*   Mucosal Neuromas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Marfanoid Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Mega Colon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Myelinated Corneal Nerve Fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>

Unlike MEN2A, parathyroid adenoma is not a component of MEN2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The MTC seen in MEN2B is the most aggressive form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Prophylactic Thyroidectomy in MEN2
For patients with MEN2 syndrome, [[genetic_testing_in_familial_cancer_cases | first-degree relatives]] are tested for the *RET* gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   If an Exon 918 mutation is found (coding for MEN2B), prophylactic thyroidectomy should be performed by one year of age due to the aggressive nature of the MTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   If the mutation codes for MTC only (Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma) or MEN2A (Exon 618 or 634), surgery can be delayed until 5 to 6 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## MEN4
[[genetic_testing_in_familial_cancer_cases | MEN4]] syndrome is caused by a mutation in the *CDKN1B* gene on chromosome 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   It includes pituitary adenomas and parathyroid adenomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   A key distinction from MEN1 is the absence of pancreatic tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   Other associated tumors include renal, adrenocortical, and reproductive organ tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

This article discusses a case scenario of a 63-year-old female presenting with unusual symptoms, leading to a broader discussion on neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), particularly glucagonoma, and their associated conditions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Patient Presentation and Initial Assessment

A 63-year-old female presented with a four-year history of uncontrolled diabetes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> This was considered unusual, as type 2 diabetes is typically diagnosed earlier, in the late 30s or early 40s, with complications arising in the 50s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Her additional symptoms included:
*   An ulcerating rash on the shin, groin, and face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Cheilitis and glossitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Symptoms worsening over four years despite specialized wound care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Severe weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Abdominal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Intractable nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Probable zinc deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

The patient's profile is notable for an elderly female with a short history of very uncontrolled diabetes and skin lesions, but no mention of common diabetic complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

## Differential Diagnosis of Diabetes

When diagnosing diabetes, it is crucial to determine the underlying pathology, not just the hyperglycemia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **Type 1 Diabetes**: Unlikely due to the patient's age at diagnosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   **Type 2 Diabetes**: Very unlikely, as resistance features would typically start much earlier, with hyperglycemia manifesting later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> Diabetes diagnosed at 60 years or older without complications is generally considered benign (Type 4). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

The patient's presentation strongly suggests a secondary cause of diabetes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

## Key Secondary Causes of Diabetes

Secondary causes of diabetes, especially in the elderly, include:
*   **Hemochromatosis**: Can cause diabetes as part of its clinical manifestations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **IgG4-related disease**: Can lead to pancreatic diabetes with pancreatic manifestations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   **Pancreatic Cancer**: A very important consideration in the elderly, where diabetes can be a presenting symptom. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   **Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)**: A very important consideration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   **[[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Somatostatinoma]]**: Can cause diabetes, but it's typically mild because somatostatin inhibits glucagon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> [[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Somatostatinoma]] is associated with [[cns_imaging_signs_related_to_various_conditions | neurofibromatosis one]], mostly arises from the duodenum, and presents with a triad of diabetes, cholelithiasis, and steatorrhea. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> It does not cause severe uncontrolled diabetes or skin lesions, making it unlikely in this patient. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   **[[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Glucagonoma]]**: This is a strong possibility given the patient's symptoms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

## [[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Glucagonoma]]

[[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Glucagonoma]] is a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   **Origin**: Mostly arises from the body and tail of the pancreas, particularly the tail, where alpha cells are more dispersed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   **Characteristics**: Typically a solitary, large lesion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   **Key Symptoms (5Ds)**: These tumors are associated with a constellation of symptoms referred to as the "5Ds" (plus weight loss). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
    1.  **Diabetes**: Rapidly worsening diabetes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>
    2.  **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: Patients are prone to thrombosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
    3.  **Depression**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    4.  **Diarrhea**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
    5.  **Dermatitis**: Specifically, necrolytic migratory erythema. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

*   **Weight Loss**: A prominent feature, due to hypoaminoacidemia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> Amino acids are utilized to form glucose, leading to frailty, fragility, and loss of muscle mass. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   **Zinc Deficiency**: Due to hypoalbuminemia, as albumin carries zinc in circulation, and proteins are used for glucose production. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   **[[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Glucagonoma]] Triad**: Necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, and abdominal pain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> Abdominal pain and diarrhea are due to excess glucagon, while cheilitis, glossitis, and depression can be features related to zinc deficiency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

## General Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)

Neuroendocrine tumors are increasingly recognized as an important area in medical examinations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   **Nomenclature**:
    *   Well-differentiated tumors are called "neuroendocrine tumors." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
    *   Poorly differentiated tumors are called "neuroendocrine carcinomas." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   **Classification**: NETs can be broadly categorized based on their embryological origin:
    *   **Foregut carcinoids**: Arise from the thymus, are aggressive, and generally have a poor prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
    *   **Midgut carcinoids**: Most commonly arise from the pancreas and have a very poor prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
    *   **Hindgut carcinoids**: Mostly arise from the rectum, are extremely benign, often incidentally detected, and have a good prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

### Associated Syndromes
Several genetic syndromes are associated with pancreatic NETs:
*   [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN1]] (due to MEN gene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN4]] (due to CDKN1B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
*   Tuberous Sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
*   [[cns_imaging_signs_related_to_various_conditions | Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>

### Common Pancreatic NETs
*   **Insulinoma**: The most common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in general sporadic cases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> While its prognosis is generally good, it tends to be worse when associated with [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN syndrome]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
*   **Gastrinoma**: The most common functional pancreatic NET in [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN1]] and [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN4]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> Sporadic gastrinomas have a poor prognosis with a high rate of metastasis, but gastrinomas associated with [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN syndrome]] generally have a better prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>
*   **[[characteristics_and_symptoms_of_glucagonoma_and_somatostatinoma | Somatostatinoma]]**: Associated with [[cns_imaging_signs_related_to_various_conditions | neurofibromatosis 1]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

## [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | Carcinoid Syndrome]]

Neuroendocrine tumors can produce various substances, leading to [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
*   **Substances Produced**: Serotonin, Kallikrein, Bradykinin, and Histamine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   **Manifestations**:
    *   Flushing (mostly due to Kallikrein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
    *   Bronchospasm (mostly due to Histamine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>
    *   Diarrhea (mostly due to Serotonin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>
*   **Timing of Syndrome**:
    *   **Midgut/Pancreatic NETs**: Substances are released into the portal circulation and cleared by the liver. [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | Carcinoid syndrome]] only manifests if there is hepatic metastasis, indicating a worse prognosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
    *   **Foregut/Thymic NETs**: Substances are released directly into systemic circulation, leading to earlier and more pronounced [[carcinoid_syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>
*   **Niacin Deficiency**: Tryptophan, a precursor to Niacin, is diverted to form large amounts of Serotonin, leading to Niacin deficiency (pellagra-like symptoms). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>
*   **Cardiac Complication**: The most significant complication of [[carcinoid_syndrome_and_its_manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] is right-sided cardiac involvement, leading to right-sided heart failure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> The most common valvular disease observed is tricuspid vegetation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>

## Diagnosis and Management

*   **Investigation of Choice**: For most pancreatic NETs, Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy (SRS) is the investigation of choice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>
*   **Other Imaging**: Endoscopic ultrasound is effective for detecting insulinomas and small gastrinomas, especially those associated with [[multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_men_syndromes | MEN1]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>
*   **Management**: Surgery is often the preferred treatment, but it may not be possible if the lesions have metastasized, as is often the case with glucagonoma by the time it is detected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>

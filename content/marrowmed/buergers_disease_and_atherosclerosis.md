## Chronic Arterial Occlusion: An Overview

[[chronic_and_acute_arterial_occlusion | Chronic arterial occlusion]] is a condition characterized by a gradual blockage of arteries, typically caused by a thrombus [00:00:06]. As the thrombus enlarges, collateral circulation may develop, providing some blood supply below the obstructed area [00:00:20].

### Claudication

Patients often present with intermittent claudication, which is a cramping pain experienced after walking a certain distance, known as the claudication distance [00:00:34]. This pain can progress to rest pain and even gangrene [00:00:46].

It is crucial to differentiate vascular claudication from other conditions:
*   **Vascular Claudication** The patient experiences pain after walking a specific distance [00:01:11], and the pain is typically felt one level lower than the block due to collateral circulation supplying areas below the obstruction [00:01:39].
*   **Neurogenic Claudication** Pain varies with posture, is relieved by bending forwards, and aggravated by standing straight [00:02:00]. This is often caused by lumbar canal stenosis [00:02:07].
*   **Osteoarthritis** Maximum pain is experienced on the first step, and the pain is localized to the affected joint [00:01:53].

#### Boud Classification of Claudication
The Boud classification categorizes claudication severity:
*   **Class 1** Pain occurs on walking but reduces as the patient continues to walk, possibly because Substance P (a pain causative agent) gets washed away [00:02:21].
*   **Class 2** Patient experiences pain on walking but continues to walk despite it [00:02:36].
*   **Class 3** Pain forces the patient to stop walking [00:02:42].
*   **Class 4** The patient develops rest pain [00:02:44].

#### Leriche Syndrome
[[Leriche Syndrome]] (aortoiliac obstruction) is a specific type of chronic arterial occlusion [00:02:57]. Its earliest and most notable feature is buttock claudication [00:03:07]. Other symptoms include absent femoral and distal pulses, a bruit over the iliac region, and impotence in males [00:03:17].

### Diagnostic Investigations

*   **Duplex/Doppler Scan** The investigation of choice for aortoiliac obstruction is a duplex or Doppler scan, which combines Doppler flow information with B-mode ultrasound for anatomical visualization [00:03:45].
*   **Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)** ABPI is calculated as the maximum systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the maximum systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery [00:04:16].
    *   **Normal Value** 0.9 to 1.4 [00:04:53].
    *   **Intermittent Claudication** Values less than 0.9 [00:04:58].
    *   **Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)** Values less than 0.4 [00:05:09].
    *   **Post-Exercise ABPI** In normal individuals, ABPI increases after exercise due to increased blood flow to lower limbs [00:05:37]. However, in patients with an arterial block, post-exercise ABPI values will fall [00:05:46].
    *   **Cardiac Mortality Risk** A 0.1 decrease in ABPI below 0.9 increases cardiac mortality risk by 10% [00:06:57].
*   **Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)** This term signifies that a patient has rest pain, with or without ulceration or gangrene [00:05:57].
*   **Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI)** TBPI is particularly important in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, where ABPI can be falsely high (more than 1.4) due to calcified vessels [00:07:20]. Digital arteries are less affected by sclerosis, making TBPI (less than 0.6 in significant arterial lesions) more reliable in identifying vascular disease in diabetic patients [00:08:03].
*   **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)** DSA provides dynamic inflow and detailed imaging information of vessels [00:09:02]. It is an invasive procedure involving dye injection, carrying risks such as bleeding, thrombosis, aneurysm, and renal dysfunction [00:09:16]. DSA is typically performed when an intervention is being planned [00:09:26].

## Buerger's Disease vs. Atherosclerosis

The two primary causes of chronic arterial occlusion are Buerger's disease and atherosclerosis [00:09:35].

| Feature                | Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans) [00:09:39] | Atherosclerosis                                    |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typical Onset Age**  | Third decade of life [00:09:50]                           | Fifth decade of life [00:09:57]                    |
| **Gender Predominance**| Males more commonly affected [00:09:54]                 | Equal male to female incidence [00:09:59]          |
| **Vessels Involved**   | Artery, vein, and nerve [00:10:55]                        | Only artery [00:11:01]                             |
| **Spread of Disease**  | Distal to proximal spread [00:11:06]                     | Proximal to distal spread [00:11:19]               |
| **Vessel Size Affected**| Small to medium-sized vessels [00:11:08]                 | Large to medium vessels [00:11:15]                 |
| **Primary Risk Factor**| Smoking [00:10:07]                                        | Smoking, Type A personality, alcohol, [[lipid_management_in_cardiovascular_disease | hyperlipidemia]] [00:10:10] |
| **Typical Gangrene**   | Gradual desiccation, good line of demarcation [00:11:26] |                                                    |
| **Angiography Findings**| Screw collaterals [00:11:39]                             |                                                    |
| **Diagnosis Confirmed By**| Muscle biopsy [00:11:47]                                |                                                    |

### Management

#### Buerger's Disease
Management of Buerger's disease focuses on:
*   **Smoking Cessation** Essential for stopping disease progression [00:12:30].
*   **Pentoxifylline** An approved medication [00:12:31].
*   **Conservative Amputations** Only the involved portion is amputated [00:12:37].
*   **Lumbar Sympathectomy** Can be performed to reduce rest pain by causing cutaneous vasodilation [00:12:41]. It is contraindicated in claudication [00:12:46]. If bilateral lumbar sympathectomy is planned, the L1 ganglion should be preserved on at least one side to prevent impotence [00:13:03].
*   **Bypass Grafts** Not useful due to the involvement and blockage of smaller, distal vessels [00:12:22].

#### Atherosclerosis
Management of atherosclerosis typically involves:
*   **Angioplasty** Considered the first line of intervention [00:13:36]. It is successful for femoropopliteal obstructions but less useful for below-knee vessels [00:13:58]. Complications can include failure, hematoma, bleeding, and thrombosis [00:14:10]. Angioplasty often involves placing a stent to maintain vessel patency [00:14:18].
*   **Bypass Grafting** Considered the best method for revascularization [00:14:29].
    *   **Above Inguinal Grafts** For obstructions like [[Leriche Syndrome]] (aortoiliac obstruction), aorto-bifemoral grafts using Dacron are preferred [00:14:34]. Dacron is the best graft material for this region [00:14:56].
    *   **Infrainguinal Grafts** The best overall graft is the reverse saphenous vein graft [00:15:03]. The best synthetic graft is PTFE [00:15:14]. When harvesting the great saphenous vein for grafting, the saphenous nerve can be injured [00:15:22].

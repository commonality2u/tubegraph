Lipid management is crucial in patients with [[medical_and_surgical_management_of_vascular_diseases | atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)]]. The primary goal in these cases, such as patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI), is to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, rather than focusing on triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:53">[03:00:53]</a>.

## Case Study: Patient with ASCVD

A 60-year-old patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes, who underwent PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) stent placement for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) the previous year, was being managed with aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:46">[02:24:46]</a>.

### Lipid Profile
During a follow-up, the patient's lipid profile indicated:
*   Raised cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:37">[02:42:37]</a>
*   Raised LDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>
*   Raised triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:15">[02:45:15]</a>
*   Normal HDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>

Despite receiving atorvastatin, presumably at the maximum possible dose, the patient's LDL levels remained high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:39">[02:54:39]</a>.

### Additional Drug Therapies for LDL Reduction
Given the elevated LDL despite statin therapy, several drugs can be added to further reduce LDL:
*   **Ezetimibe** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>
*   **Evolocumab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>
*   **Bempedoic acid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:63">[03:33:63]</a>

### Drugs Not Primarily Used for LDL Reduction in this Context
*   **Gemfibrozil** is a fibrate primarily used to decrease triglycerides, not LDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:95">[03:26:95]</a>.

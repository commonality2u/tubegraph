From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The [[NEET PG 2024 Exam Analysis | NEET PG 2024]] examination has concluded, leading to a recall session for anesthesia questions. This session aims to review the questions asked and understand shifts in the exam pattern to better prepare for future medical entrance examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## General Observations

Anesthesia questions in NEETPG 2024 were generally well-answered by students who had thoroughly reviewed video lectures and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While most information was covered, some areas required critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The session also emphasized the need for students to adjust their preparation mindset due to a slightly more complicated "session two" of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Recalled Anesthesia Questions (Session 1)

### Mechanical Ventilation and PEEP
A patient on mechanical ventilation in a prone position was maintained on PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The question asked about the significance of PEEP.

*   **Explanation of PEEP**: PEEP is positive end-expiratory pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. During expiration, alveoli tend to collapse due to elastic recoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While surfactant normally prevents complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, in conditions like ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) where prone position is often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, lung compliance is affected, leading to alveolar collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. PEEP applies positive pressure during exhalation to keep the alveoli open, thereby improving oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Decreases inspiratory pressure: Incorrect, PEEP *adds* expiratory pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Increases venous return and cardiac output: Incorrect. Positive intrathoracic pressure (as with PEEP) decreases venous return and preload, thereby reducing cardiac output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   Reduces carbon dioxide in the alveoli: Incorrect. Carbon dioxide has a high diffusion capacity and easily escapes when alveoli are open; the primary problem in ARDS is oxygenation, not CO2 retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: PEEP prevents alveolar collapse (atelectasis) and aids in lung function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This question has been asked multiple times in previous exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Acute Exacerbation of COPD and Pneumothorax
A patient with acute exacerbation of COPD on mechanical ventilation experienced a saturation drop, with normal vesicular breath sounds on the left side. A chest X-ray showed findings. The question asked for the expected auscultatory findings on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis**: The combination of COPD, mechanical ventilation, saturation drop, and the provided chest X-ray (showing absence of lung markings on the right) strongly suggests a right-sided pneumothorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Patients with obstructive lung diseases on ventilation are at risk of pneumothorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Clinical Findings of Pneumothorax**: On the affected side, there is:
    *   No or decreased air entry/breath sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Reduced chest wall movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
    *   Hyperresonant note on percussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Bronchial breath sounds: Incorrect, breath sounds are diminished or absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   Increased vesicular breath sounds: Incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   Increased vocal fremitus/resonance: Incorrect. Vocal fremitus is decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. While hyperresonance is on percussion, the question asked for *auscultatory* findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Absent breath sounds on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Positive pressure ventilation will worsen a pneumothorax, explaining the saturation drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Tracheal Deviation and Difficult Procedures
A radiograph of the neck showed tracheal deviation to one side. The question asked which procedure would be difficult to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis from X-ray**: The image showed a deviated trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Evaluation of Procedures**:
    *   **Nasogastric tube insertion**: Not difficult, as the NG tube goes behind the trachea into the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   **LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway) insertion**: Not difficult. LMA is a supraglottic airway device that sits above the glottis and is not significantly affected by tracheal deviation. Difficulties usually arise from inadequate mouth opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
    *   **Indirect laryngoscopy**: Not difficult. This procedure, performed using a mirror, views the vocal cords and is not affected by tracheal deviation below the cords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
    *   **Tracheostomy**: **Difficult**. Tracheostomy involves a midline incision to access the tracheal rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. If the trachea is deviated, identifying and incising it precisely becomes challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Tracheostomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Identifying an Airway Instrument
An image of an instrument was shown, and the question asked to identify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

*   **Instrument Identification**: The image depicted a nasopharyngeal airway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Distinction**:
    *   **Oropharyngeal airway (Guedel airway)**: Prevents tongue fall-back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
    *   **Uncuffed endotracheal tube**: Longer and narrower than the depicted instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Nasopharyngeal Airway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

### EMLA Cream and Local Anesthetics
A patient was given a local anesthetic before IV cannulation, and a picture of EMLA cream was shown. The question asked which statement about it was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

*   **EMLA Cream Composition and Mechanism**: EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Eutectic means the mixture has a lower melting point than its individual components, allowing it to be absorbed into the skin to numb the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. It is often applied under a sticker (e.g., Tegaderm, Chhabra beam) 30-45 minutes before a procedure, especially in children, to minimize pain during IV cannulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Side Effect**: Prilocaine, when used in overdose, can cause methemoglobinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. There are case reports of methemoglobinemia occurring in neonates due to EMLA cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Concentration**: EMLA cream is typically available as 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. A 1g tube of 2.5% cream contains 25mg of each drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer (Likely)**: While methemoglobinemia is a true side effect, the most definitive and defining characteristic is that it's a eutectic mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. The exact framing of the question and options is crucial here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

### Oxygen Delivery Devices (COVID Scenario)
An 80-year-old male with COVID had an oxygen saturation of 84% and was receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. The full question was not recalled by students.

*   **Oxygen Delivery Devices**:
    *   **High-flow fixed performance**: e.g., Venturi mask, delivers a precise FiO2, often used in COPD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
    *   **Low-flow variable performance**:
        *   **Nasal cannula**: Flow rate 1-6 L/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Each 1 L/min increases FiO2 by approximately 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. So, at 4 L/min, the increase is 16%, plus ambient air (21%), resulting in an FiO2 of approximately 37% (16% + 21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Total FiO2 with nasal cannula ranges from 24% (1 L/min + 21%) to 45% (6 L/min + 21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
        *   **Simple oxygen mask**: 6-10 L/min, delivers 60-65% FiO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
        *   **Non-rebreathing mask (NRBM)**: 10-15 L/min, delivers 80-85% FiO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   This question likely asked about the FiO2 delivered or the type of device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. [[anaesthesia_questions_in_inicet_nov_24 | INICET Nov 24]] also featured a question about oxygen delivery devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

### Reversal of Vecuronium
The question asked which agent could be used for the reversal of vecuronium when renal function tests are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

*   **Traditional Reversal**: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants are traditionally reversed with Neostigmine, typically with an anticholinergic like Glycopyrrolate or Atropine to counter muscarinic side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
*   **Sugammadex**: Introduced around 2017-2018 (in India in March-May 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>, Sugammadex is a novel reversal agent primarily known for rocuronium reversal, creating a rapid "switch-like" recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. It binds to the non-depolarizing muscle relaxant molecule (e.g., rocuronium) and is excreted via the renal route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Crucially, it is also effective for other steroidal compounds like vecuronium, given their similar pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Physostigmine/Rasmins/Pyostigmine: Not clinically used for muscle relaxant reversal due to various side effects (e.g., Physostigmine crossing the blood-brain barrier for central anticholinergic effects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
    *   Succinylcholine: A depolarizing muscle relaxant, not a reversal agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Sugammadex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Given normal renal function, Sugammadex is a viable and rapid option for vecuronium reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

### ECG Interpretation and Management (Pediatric VT)
A 3-year-old child presented as drowsy with refusal to feed, was stuporous, and an ECG showed Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. The question asked for the next best step.

*   **ACLS/PALS Rhythms**: In Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) or Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), cardiac rhythms are classified as:
    *   **Non-shockable**: Asystole (flat line) and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
    *   **Shockable**: Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT) or Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. The given ECG for VT is a shockable rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Management of Shockable Rhythm**: Immediate defibrillation should be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. Crucially, after defibrillation, CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) should be continued for 2 minutes before checking the rhythm again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Immediate synchronized cardioversion: Generally used for narrow QRS complexes, not for VT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
    *   Defibrillate, then immediately check rhythm: Incorrect, CPR must follow immediately for 2 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   Stop CPR and do cardioversion: Incorrect, CPR should not be stopped in a pulseless rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Defibrillate, followed by CPR for 2 minutes, then check the rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Recalled Anesthesia Questions (Session 2)

### Ideal Position for Intubation
An image of a patient in a specific position was shown, asking what was true about this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

*   **Position Identification**: The image shows the "sniffing of morning air" position, which is the ideal position for endotracheal intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: This position aligns the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes, allowing for better visualization of the glottic opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. It involves flexion at the lower cervical spine and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Rose position: This involves placing pillows under the scapulae, not the occiput, and is not the sniffing position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
    *   Ideal position for neurosurgery: No single "ideal" position for neurosurgery; it depends on the specific surgical site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
    *   Ideal position for bougie insertion: While a bougie can assist in difficult intubations, this position itself is not *for* bougie insertion but for direct visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Sniffing position for intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

### Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (Bier Block)
An image showed a tourniquet inflated on the arm with an IV cannula in place. The question asked which procedure was being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

*   **Procedure Identification**: This is a classic image of a Bier block, also known as Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: A tourniquet (often a BP cuff) is inflated to occlude circulation, and a local anesthetic is injected intravenously into the limb distal to the tourniquet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. The anesthetic spreads through the venous system to block nerves, causing numbness within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Simple and effective, does not require detailed anatomical knowledge for nerve localization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Approved Drugs**: Lidocaine 0.5% is approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Prilocaine can also be considered but is less available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Contraindicated Drugs**: Bupivacaine is contraindicated due to severe cardiotoxicity if the tourniquet accidentally loosens and the drug enters systemic circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. While lidocaine can cause seizures if it enters systemically, seizures are manageable, whereas bupivacaine-induced arrhythmias are very difficult to treat (treated with 20% intralipid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Bier block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

### Malignant Hyperthermia
A patient undergoing implant surgery under general anesthesia developed tachycardia, sudden rise in body temperature, and muscle rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. The question asked about the most likely drug to cause this.

*   **Diagnosis**: The triad of tachycardia, sudden temperature rise, and muscle rigidity is highly indicative of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. Increased end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) is also a key sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Triggering Agents**: The most common triggers for MH are all inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Clinical Scenario Differentiation**:
    *   **Malignant Hyperthermia**: Sudden tachycardia, hypertension, increased body temperature, increased EtCO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
    *   **Bronchospasm**: Sudden tachycardia, hypertension, shark-fin pattern on EtCO2, increased airway resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
    *   **Laryngospasm**: Sudden tachycardia, stridor, rapid desaturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
    *   **Anaphylaxis**: Sudden tachycardia, hypotension, increased airway resistance, airway/facial edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Evaluation of Options**:
    *   Halothane: An inhalational agent, a known trigger for MH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.
    *   Nitrous oxide: A gas, does not trigger MH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
    *   Etomidate: An intravenous anesthetic, does not trigger MH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
    *   Propofol: A safer intravenous anesthetic, does not trigger MH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Halothane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

### Ambu Bag Pop-Off Valve Pressure
An image of an Ambu bag (self-inflating manual resuscitator) was shown, with a marked pop-off valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The question asked at what pressure this structure opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

*   **Function**: The pop-off valve (or pressure relief valve) prevents barotrauma by releasing excess pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. This is particularly important in pediatric bags due to fragile lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Pressure Units**: Pressure in this context is measured in cm of water (cm H2O), ruling out mmHg options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.
*   **Normal Breathing vs. Positive Pressure Ventilation**: Normal breathing is negative pressure inspiration (-5 to -8 cm H2O intrathoracic pressure), with exhalation returning to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. Manual resuscitators provide positive pressure ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Pressure Range**: For a normal lung, typical positive pressure ventilation generates 10-20 cm H2O in the airways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. A pop-off valve opening at this range would hinder effective ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.
*   **Pop-off Valve Setting**: Most manufacturers mark their Ambu bags (especially pediatric ones) with a pop-off pressure of **30-40 cm H2O** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. Adult bags might open at up to 60 cm H2O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: 30-40 cm H2O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.

### Capnograph Interpretation
An image of a normal capnograph was shown, and the question asked what was true about segment C to D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

*   **Capnography Basics**: Capnography is the graphical representation of exhaled carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. A normal capnograph has four phases:
    *   **Phase 1 (A to B)**: Exhalation of dead space gas (no CO2), staying at baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (B to C)**: Expiratory upstroke, representing mixed dead space and alveolar gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (C to D)**: Alveolar plateau phase, where gases from middle and lower alveoli are exhaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. It shows a slight upward slope due to unequal emptying of alveoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) is measured at the end of this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Phase 4/0 (D to E)**: Inspiratory downstroke, representing the inhalation of fresh gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>.
*   **Normal Capnograph Shape**: The overall shape resembles a "top hat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

### Recovery Position
An image showed a patient in the left lateral recovery position. The question asked when this position is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. This was a repeat question from [[NEETPG 2023 | NEET PG 2023]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

*   **Recovery Position Use**: This position is used for unresponsive patients who have a pulse and are breathing spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Scenarios**:
    *   If pulse and breathing are absent, CPR should be initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
    *   If the patient is unresponsive with a pulse but *without* breathing (or gasping), rescue breaths should be given (one breath every 6 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Correct Answer**: Unresponsive patient with pulse and breathing present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

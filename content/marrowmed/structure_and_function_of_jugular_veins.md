## External Jugular Vein (EJV)

The external jugular vein is a superficial vein in the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. It runs superficial to the [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | sternocleidomastoid muscle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, separating it from the [[Structure and function of jugular veins | internal jugular vein]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Formation and Course
The external jugular vein is formed by the union of the posterior division of the retromandibular vein and the posterior auricular vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It descends in the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Drainage
The EJV pierces the investing layer of deep cervical fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This piercing occurs in the lower part of the posterior triangle, also known as the supraclavicular triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. It then drains into the subclavian vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Associated Nerves
The [[Nerve injuries in neck anatomy | great auricular nerve]] runs with the external jugular vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This nerve supplies sensation to the lobule of the ear, the skin at the angle of the mandible, and the parotid region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Internal Jugular Vein (IJV)

The internal jugular vein is located deep to the [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | sternocleidomastoid muscle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Formation and Tributaries
The internal jugular vein originates from the cranial cavity, formed by the sigmoid sinus and inferior petrosal sinus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The common facial vein is a tributary of the internal jugular vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The common facial vein itself is formed by the anterior division of the retromandibular vein and the facial vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Connection to Brachiocephalic Vein
The internal jugular vein joins with the subclavian vein (which carries blood from the brachium) to form the brachiocephalic vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The brachiocephalic vein gets its name from combining "brachium" (arm) and "cephalic" (head), indicating it carries blood from both regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

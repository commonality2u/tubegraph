Stridor is a key symptom indicating respiratory distress, especially when observed in neonates. It is crucial to identify the underlying causes to ensure proper management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

## Common Causes of Stridor in Newborns

### Laryngomalacia
Laryngomalacia is recognized as the most common cause of stridor in newborns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. It presents with inspiratory stridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Subglottic Stenosis
Subglottic stenosis is another significant cause of stridor in neonates, ranking as the third most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. It typically leads to biphasic stridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

## Conditions Not Typically Causing Stridor in Neonates

### Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis
While recurrent respiratory papillomatosis can lead to stridor, it is generally not a cause seen in newborns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   **Acquisition**: This condition, also known as juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis, is acquired at birth through the birth canal via vaginal delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
*   **Presentation**: It typically presents with hoarseness (of voice or cry) months or even years after birth, as the papillomas first appear on the true vocal cords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Stridor only occurs later if the papillomas become exuberant and completely block the larynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Therefore, stridor is not the initial presenting feature and is not seen in neonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

### Hemorrhagic Polyp
A hemorrhagic polyp is a single polyp and does not typically cause stridor, especially not in neonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

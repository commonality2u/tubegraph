Dr. Akshhat, who secured Rank 8 in the INI CET May 2025 examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, emphasizes a balanced and personalized approach to [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences | exam preparation]], focusing on deep understanding and mental well-being alongside strategic study techniques.

## Early Preparation and Building a Strong Foundation

Dr. Akshhat's journey began with a focus on becoming a good doctor rather than solely aiming for a postgraduate (PG) exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He did not plan for the PG exam with the same intensity as his undergraduate (UG) exams, believing in maintaining a balance in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Clinical Knowledge Optimization**: Throughout his four and a half years of MBBS before internship, he focused on optimizing his clinical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Low-Pressure Initial Phase**: He started using Marrow from his second year, putting "almost zero pressure" on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. His approach was to watch only one to three videos per day, allowing time for the knowledge to sink in from videos, college, and patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Deep Understanding**: This early, low-energy approach helped him build a strong clinical base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He stuck to standard books for first year, then Marrow videos from second year onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. By final year/internship, he had finished watching all subject videos, without engaging in question banks or other materials initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Learning**: Videos significantly enhanced his clinical understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He would Google terms not in notes and connect concepts, such as integrating physiology with medicine in cardiology, which proved beneficial for exam questions like Frank-Starling law or pulse types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This deep understanding from early study meant he didn't need to revise these foundational topics later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Clinical Application**: His internship allowed for clinical revision of previously learned material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Diagnosing and treating patients in real-life scenarios, such as hypothyroidism or Kawasaki disease, solidified his knowledge on those topics without needing additional study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

## Study Habits and Material Management

*   **Personalized Notes**: Dr. Akshhat used hard copy notes from Marrow, preferring not to write extensively due to poor handwriting and a dislike for writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He added extra information or personal memory aids (even using slangs) directly into these printed notes, making them personalized for recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent Revision Source**: For effective revision, he consistently used the same personalized notes, which fostered a photographic memory of where information was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Categorizing Study Tasks**: He advises categorizing study methods into "high energy," "middle energy," and "low energy" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. For instance, watching a video for the first time is high energy, while watching a revision or MCQ video for a known subject is low energy. This allows for productive study even when exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Targeted Final Preparation

Dr. Akshhat's main preparation phase began only five months before the exam (from January to May) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, after his internship ended in mid-February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. During this period, his approach was "targeted consistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

*   **Focus on Previous Year Questions (PQs)**: He solved all 285 Previous Year Questions (PQs) for both NEET PG and INI CET, recognizing that 130-140 questions in INI CET are often repackaged versions of previous exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This focus allowed him to answer questions even on topics he hadn't studied in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Understanding Rank Makers**: He acknowledged that 60-70 questions are "rank makers" and cannot be fully prepared for, thus emphasizing the importance of PQs as the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Strategic MCQ Practice**: He rarely used subject-wise question banks, except for two subjects (Forensic and Anesthesia) where he was free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Instead, he extensively used custom modules from Marrow's QBank in the last six months to practice [[Time management skills during exams | time management skills during exams]] and [[Problemsolving strategies in exams | problemsolving strategies in exams]] under time pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
    *   He solved custom modules (25-50 questions) on the go, whether walking or in a cab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
    *   He used tags like "PQs," "all," "image-based," "INI CET only," or "everything combined" for these modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   The goal was to optimize thinking within a time crunch rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Grand Test (GT) Strategy**: He gave 8-9 Grand Tests (GTs) starting from February, roughly every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
    *   He spent *more* time reviewing GTs than taking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
    *   He reviewed all 200 questions (200 topics), even correct ones, to ensure he understood underlying concepts or addressed any doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   His scores consistently improved, from 127 correct in his first GT to over 155 in his last four, with a high of 169 correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Focused Revision**: In the final months, he mainly relied on revision videos, adding minor notes to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. He specifically brushed up on subjects like ENT and Ophthalmology, which are often "know it or you don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Well-being

*   **Self-Talk and Confidence**: Dr. Akshhat emphasized that the "battle with oneself" (self-doubt, under-confidence) is more important than the rank itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. He believes one should aim to live and do their best, rather than being overly attached to a single number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Process-Oriented Mindset**: He advises setting a goal but then "forgetting about the goal and just focusing on the process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **Support System**: His mother played a crucial role in counseling him when he felt low, providing immense relief and motivating him to double down on his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Personalized Study Environment**: There is no "correct way" to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Half the journey is finding the "perfect optimized balance and optimized situation" for individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. His parents provided the necessary space and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Rest and Relaxation Before Exam**: The day before the exam, he deliberately relaxed his mind. He studied for only about an hour in the morning, then traveled to the center, talked to friends and family, watched a movie, and slept stress-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. This calmness allowed him to perform his best during the three-hour exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Balancing Life and Study**: During internship, he prioritized enjoying his time and avoiding studying, only giving one Grand Test in 11 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This helped him avoid sadness or depression, as he had no excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He stressed the importance of being fully present, whether focusing on clinical duties, taking a break, or studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

Amenorrhea, specifically primary amenorrhea, combined with cyclical abdominal pain, is indicative of cryptomenorrhea or hidden menstruation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. This condition involves menstrual blood collection that cannot exit the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:45">[01:46:45]</a>.

## Causes of Cryptomenorrhea
The primary causes of cryptomenorrhea are obstructive conditions:
*   **Imperforate Hymen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>
    *   Obstruction is at the level of the introitus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
    *   More often leads to hematometra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>.
    *   Local examination reveals a blue, tense hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.
    *   Cough impulse is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Transverse Vaginal Septum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>
    *   Obstruction is higher up, at the junction of the upper and lower vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
    *   More often leads to hematocolpos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.
    *   No blue bulge will be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>, and the hymen will appear normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.
    *   Blood impulse will be absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.
    *   Can be associated with endometriosis due to retrograde menstruation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.

### Clinical Presentation
Patients with cryptomenorrhea typically present with cyclical abdominal pain every month but do not menstruate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. A bulky uterus may be felt on examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. Acute urinary retention can also be a presenting complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

### Diagnosis
The best way to differentiate between a vaginal septum and an imperforate hymen is by performing an MRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.

### Management
For an imperforate hymen, the management involves making a crucial incision on the hymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

## Secondary Amenorrhea in Athletes
An athlete with a low BMI (e.g., 17.5 kg/mÂ²) presenting with secondary amenorrhea and primary infertility, along with low LH and FSH levels, indicates hypogonadotropic hypogonadism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>.
*   **Hormone Levels**
    *   Normal LH and FSH values are typically between 1 to 10 International Units, but levels less than 4 IU are generally considered decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>.
    *   Normal prolactin levels are less than 20 to 25 nanograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.
*   **Cause**
    *   Intense exercise in athletes can lead to a negative feedback on LH and FSH, resulting in low levels of these hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.
    *   Slightly higher prolactin levels can also contribute to this negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>.
*   **Management of Hyperprolactinemia**
    *   The drug of choice for treating hyperprolactinemia is Cabergoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

## Unexplained Infertility
When a couple has not conceived after one year of unprotected intercourse, infertility testing is pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>.
*   **Basic Investigations**
    *   Semen analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:35">[01:46:35]</a>.
    *   Tests for ovulation, such as serum progesterone levels on day 22 of the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>.
    *   Hysterosalpingography (HSG) between day 5 and day 10 of the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:52">[01:46:52]</a>.
*   **Definition**
    *   If all basic tests (semen analysis, hormone levels, and tubal patency via HSG) are normal, the condition is classified as unexplained infertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**
    *   Unexplained infertility contributes to 8% to 28% of infertility cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>. UpToDate indicates a figure of 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>.
*   **Management**
    *   Management for unexplained infertility includes Clomiphene citrate combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.

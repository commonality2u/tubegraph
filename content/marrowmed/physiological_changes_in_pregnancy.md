Physiological changes in pregnancy are considered "extremely important" for medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Cardiovascular Changes

During pregnancy, peripheral vascular resistance decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This is primarily due to the presence of progesterone, which acts as a smooth muscle relaxant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Blood Pressure**
    *   Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   The maximum decrease in blood pressure is typically observed during the second trimester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Blood Volume**
    *   Total blood volume increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   This increase is due to increases in both plasma volume and red blood cell (RBC) volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Plasma volume, specifically, increases by 20% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Metabolic Changes

Pregnancy is considered a [[understanding_common_conditions_related_to_endocrinology | diabetogenic stage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Insulin Resistance**
    *   There is a significant increase in insulin resistance, mainly due to the hormone Human Placental Lactogen (HPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Insulin resistance advances as pregnancy progresses, with the most significant resistance seen between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   This resistance causes postprandial hyperglycemia (high blood sugar after meals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and fasting hypoglycemia (low blood sugar during fasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This is because the fetus depends on the mother for glucose, and HPL ensures glucose is available for the fetus, even at the mother's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   For this reason, pregnant individuals are advised against fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

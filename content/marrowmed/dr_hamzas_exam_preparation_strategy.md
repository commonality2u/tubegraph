Dr. Hamza achieved an All India Rank (AIR) of nine in the recently conducted November INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">01:10:13</a>. Previously, he secured an AIR of 185 in the NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">01:29:05</a>. He completed his undergraduate studies from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Medical College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">01:04:06</a>. Dr. Hamza attributes his improved rank from 185 to 9 to enhanced [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences | McQ skills]] developed during his INI CET [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:05">10:29:05</a>.

## Approach to Exam Preparation

Despite a good rank in NEET PG, Dr. Hamza was initially hesitant to appear for the INI CET exam due to a perceived lack of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:05">09:44:05</a>. However, a friend, Krish, convinced him to give the exam a try and recommended using Marrow's QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:05">09:56:05</a>. This decision proved to be one of the best for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:05">10:16:05</a>.

He identified that a significant lacking in his previous [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | NEET exam preparation]] was [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences | McQ skills]], as he had focused primarily on theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:05">10:06:05</a>. To address this, he committed to solving as many questions as possible within the available time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">03:09:05</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow QBank

Dr. Hamza found the quality of questions in Marrow's QBank to be "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">01:55:05</a>. Key features he appreciated included:
*   **Concise and Crisp Explanations**: The explanations were to the point and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">02:02:05</a>.
*   **High-Quality Images**: The images provided were of excellent quality, making the questions engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">02:09:05</a>.
*   **Pearls**: The "pearls" at the end of explanations offered a broad perspective on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">02:27:05</a>.

### Daily Question Targets and Strategy
Initially, as he joined Marrow only two months before the exam, his first priority was solving PYQs (Previous Year Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">02:40:05</a>. He aimed to solve at least 200 questions per day to stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:05">02:56:05</a>.

His daily strategy for questions was:
*   **Subject-wise Focus**: He dedicated each day to a single subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:05">03:32:05</a>.
*   **Question Distribution**: Within that subject, he solved 100 PYQs and 100 questions from the "first module" (likely general QBank questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">03:37:05</a>.
*   **Custom Modules**: He used custom modules to focus on one subject at a time, ensuring each subject received adequate attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:05">03:53:05</a>.

### Utilizing Explanations and Bookmarking
He read explanations "very, very quickly" due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:05">04:32:05</a>. A crucial part of his [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | strategy]] was **bookmarking questions**:
*   **Wrong Questions**: Obviously, questions answered incorrectly were bookmarked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:05">04:57:05</a>.
*   **Correct but Potentially Forgettable Questions**: He also bookmarked questions he answered correctly but felt he might forget in the future or commit wrong later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:05">05:01:05</a>.
*   **Questions with Extra Information**: If an explanation contained valuable additional information (e.g., multiple instruments in an [[ENT exam questions and strategies | OBGY]] question about a Sims speculum), he would bookmark the question for later review of that content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:05">05:10:05</a>.

## Developing McQ Skills

Dr. Hamza emphasizes that the ability to rule out options and select the correct answer, especially when two options seem plausible, is a "skill which comes with the question practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:05">06:27:05</a>. It's not something that happens "overnight" but develops "day by day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:05">07:10:05</a>. He advises reviewing every question to understand the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:05">06:57:05</a>.

## Grand Tests (GTs)

He regularly gave Marrow GTs and found that the ranks in these tests correlated very closely with his actual exam rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:05">07:32:05</a>. In GTs, he always tried to attempt all 200 questions to maximize chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:05">08:29:05</a>. In the actual exam, he attempted 196 questions, leaving only four that were "completely out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:05">08:41:05</a>. He believes the number of questions to attempt depends on one's preparation level and ability to "push the pedal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:05">08:59:05</a>.

## Future Plans

Dr. Hamza is from Northeast Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:05">11:25:05</a>. With his rank, his choice of institution is likely AIIMS Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:05">11:03:05</a>. He is inclined towards medical branches, specifically confused between Radiology and General Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:05">11:40:05</a>. He desires a work-life balance (suggesting Radiology) but also values patient interaction (suggesting Medicine), while being wary of hectic duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:05">11:46:05</a>.

He acknowledges that his life has primarily revolved around studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:05">14:07:05</a> and plans to develop hobbies moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:05">14:41:05</a>.

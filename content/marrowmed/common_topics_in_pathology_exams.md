The November 2024 [[pathology_questions_in_inict_november_2024_exam | INICT exam]] for medical students featured a moderate to severe difficulty level, largely dependent on the frequency of subject revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Students noted that the questions were not direct or very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Approximately 20 to 25 questions, with overlaps, were from Pathology, a significant number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Pathology's importance stems from its status as a core first and second-year subject, connecting various medical fields like medicine, surgery, and gynaecology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While direct repeat questions were less frequent, the underlying topics were often repeated across both [[pathology_questions_in_inict_november_2024_exam | INICT]] and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This highlights the importance of studying topics thoroughly and in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. A notable feature of this exam was the inclusion of four "match the following" Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), which can simplify problem-solving if even a couple of options are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The exam leaned towards factual questions rather than extensive clinico-pathologic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>.

## Topic-Wise Distribution

### General Pathology
*   General Pathology topics included BOSI and causes of inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Two new topics introduced were neoplasia and tumor markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also an expected question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. EMT is caused by transcription factors like Snail and Twist, which are crucial for metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

### Genetics

Clinically, it presents with nocturnal hemoglobinuria and thrombocytopenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The most common cause of death is thrombosis, particularly Budd-Chiari syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

Flow cytometry showing TDT, CD10, CD19, and CD22 positivity indicates B-ALL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, CD117, myeloperoxidase) are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Study Advice
To succeed in MCQ exams like [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam | INICT]], consistent revision is crucial, as a single reading is often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Focusing on a single, reliable study source and repeatedly revising from it is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

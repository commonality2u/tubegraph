Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm development, a key aspect of [[general_embryology | general embryology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Sperm Structure
A sperm consists of a head, a small neck part, and a tail piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The tail piece is further divided into three segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
*   **Middle Piece (Midpiece)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   **Principal Piece** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   **Terminal Piece** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

## Functions of Sperm Parts
*   **Middle Piece (Midpiece)**: This segment is known as the "Powerhouse of the sperm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It contains numerous mitochondria, which are essential for energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The mitochondrial sheath is found in the middle piece of the sperm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Piece**: This part of the tail is primarily responsible for sperm motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Comparison with Oogenesis Meiosis Arrest
While discussing germ cell development in [[general_embryology | general embryology]], it's notable that primary oocytes undergo specific arrests during meiosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>:
*   **Primary Oocyte**: Arrested in the Diplotene phase of Meiosis I until puberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Secondary Oocyte**: Arrested in metaphase of Meiosis II for only 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

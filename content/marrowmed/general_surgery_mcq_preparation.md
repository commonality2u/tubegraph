Before starting multiple-choice question (MCQ) discussions, it is important to understand the overall approach to preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Importance of Practice and Overview of Modules

The MCQ modules cover important questions, key topics, and previous year's questions, along with strategies on [[Surgery_Question_Topics_and_Patterns | how to answer these questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, these discussions are not a substitute for extensive practice using a [[Utilizing_Question_Banks_for_Competitive_Medical_Exams | Qbank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is essential to [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | practice more]] and [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | solve more questions]] independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

A dedicated module has been created to discuss difficult Grand Test (GT) questions, particularly those where many students faced challenges, offering insights into their construction and approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Exam Success

For [[preparation_strategies_for_surgical_exams | medical entrance exam preparation]], especially in the crucial final months leading up to the exam, consistent [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | practice]] and [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | discipline]] are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Maintaining high motivation levels daily is also crucial to prevent dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Being disciplined and regular with study work increases the likelihood of achieving a good rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Key General Surgery Topics for MCQs

The following topics are important for the general surgery exam, often appearing as MCQs:

### Patient Safety and Protocols
*   **Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Protocols**: These protocols aim for faster patient recovery by optimizing pre-surgical, intra-surgical, and post-surgical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Carbohydrate-rich clear liquids allowed up to 2 hours pre-surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   Avoiding mechanical bowel preparation due to fluid/electrolyte imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   Solids permitted up to 6 hours pre-surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Minimally invasive techniques preferred during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Use of long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Keeping patients warm and giving maintenance IV fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   Using at least two classes of drugs for post-operative nausea and vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   NSAIDs for pain, opioids only for breakthrough pain post-operatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   Regular diet and ambulation within 24 hours post-operatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   Discontinuation of IV fluids within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Less and less drains inserted to facilitate discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Surgical Safety Checklist**: This checklist has three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
    *   **Sign In**: Before anesthesia induction (checking consent, patient identity, site marking, allergies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Time Out**: Before skin incision (reconfirming patient details, surgical plan, anesthesia concerns, antibiotic prophylaxis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Sign Out**: Before patient leaves operating room (instrument/gauze count, specimen labeling, estimated blood loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Counting mops and equipment at this phase prevents complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Patient Safety Events**:
    *   **Near Miss**: An event that *could* have caused harm but was prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> (e.g., stopping IV bolus potassium which can cause arrhythmias) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   **Adverse Event**: Harm *occurs* to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **No Harm Event**: An event occurs that shouldn't have, but causes no harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Hand Hygiene**: Based on WHO's five moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>:
    *   Before touching a patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
    *   After touching a patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
    *   Before a procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   After exposure to body fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   After touching the patient's surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   Hand sanitizer can be used in these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   Soap and water are mandatory when hands are visibly soiled or after using the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Pre-Surgical Preventive Practices**:
    *   Improved nutrient intake at least 2 weeks before surgery benefits outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   Smoking cessation shows maximum benefit if done at least 6-8 weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
    *   Bathing with antiseptic soap reduces Surgical Site Infection (SSI) rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
    *   Chronic anemia is better tolerated than acute blood loss before surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Surgical Procedures and Equipment
*   **Surgical Positions**:
    *   **Reverse Trendelenburg**: Head raised, foot low, used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. CO2 retention beneath the right diaphragm can cause referred right shoulder tip pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   **Trendelenburg**: Foot raised, head low, used for pelvic surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   **Lithotomy**: Used for gynecological and pelvic procedures, prolonged use increases risk of common peroneal nerve injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Fowler's (Sitting) Position**: Used for CNS surgery, offers better exposure and less bleeding but increases risk of air embolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **IV Cannula Sizes and Flow Rates**: Crucial for rapid fluid infusion in hypovolemic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. A wider bore allows faster flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.*   Orange (14 gauge): 240 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   Gray (16 gauge): 180 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   Green (18 gauge): 96 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
*   Pink (20 gauge): 60 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Blue (22 gauge): 36 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
*   Yellow (24 gauge): 20 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
*   Violet (26 gauge): 13 ml/min <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>
*   **Central Lines**: Tip should lie in the superior vena cava, just above the right atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Chest X-ray is required post-procedure to rule out pneumothorax and confirm position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The most serious complication is central line infection/sepsis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) is inserted peripherally but the tip position is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Cautery**:
    *   **Cutting Mode**: Continuous, low voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
    *   **Coagulation Mode**: Alternating current, high voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   **Monopolar Cautery**: Pencil-like instrument, used for both cutting and coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Can cause thermal damage to nerves and interfere with cardiac pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
    *   **Bipolar Cautery**: Prong-like instrument, used only for coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Safer near vital nerves and can be used in patients with cardiac pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Rates**: Classification by wound type and antibiotic prophylaxis use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>:
    *   **Clean Wounds**: (e.g., thyroid or breast surgery) 1-2% risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
    *   **Clean Contaminated Wounds**: (e.g., elective cholecystectomy, abdominal hysterectomy) 3% with prophylaxis, 6-9% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
    *   **Contaminated Wounds**: (e.g., emergency cholecystectomy, opened bowel with obstruction) 6% with prophylaxis, 20% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
    *   **Dirty Wounds**: (e.g., pus present, fecal contamination, abscesses) 7-8% with prophylaxis, 20-40% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   **Burst Abdomen (Abdominal Wound Dehiscence)**:
    *   Usually presents around day 6 post-op <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
    *   Characterized by a reddish fluid discharge (salmon fluid sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
    *   More common with midline incisions than transverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   Increased incidence if suture length is less than 4 times the wound length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
    *   Lower incidence if non-absorbable sutures are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
    *   Management involves temporary measures like a Bota bag/Euro bag laparostomy, followed by definitive re-suturing of the rectus sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Suturing Techniques**:
    *   **Horizontal Mattress Suture**: Causes eversion, hemostatic in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
    *   **Vertical Mattress Suture**: Goes deep, then superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
    *   **Subcuticular Suturing**: Cosmetically superior, best done with monofilament (e.g., Monocryl 3-0 or 4-0) on a cutting needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Cutting needles are needed for tough structures like skin, sheath, and fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Surgical Staplers**:
    *   **Circular Stapler**: Used for esophageal anastomosis (e.g., post-total gastrectomy), hemorrhoid surgery, and low anterior resection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
    *   **Linear Stapler**: Used for Zenker's diverticulectomy, side-to-side bowel anastomosis, and sleeve gastrectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Surgical Drains**:
    *   **Romovac Drain**: Closed suction drain, creates negative pressure, used after mastectomy, neck dissection, thyroidectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
    *   **Minivac Drain**: Miniature version of Romovac, used for smaller incisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
    *   **Jackson Pratt Drain**: Closed suction drain with a bulb and flat tube, can be used intra-abdominally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

### Wound Care and Healing
*   **Skin Grafting**:
    *   **Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG)**: Identified by "meshing" (cuts) to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Graft Survival Mechanisms**:
        *   **Imbibition**: Days 1-2 (nutritional supply via direct absorption from wound bed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
        *   **Inosculation**: Days 2-4 (connection of graft capillaries with host vessels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
        *   **Neovascularization**: Beyond Day 4 (formation of new blood vessels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **VAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) Dressing**:
    *   Also known as negative pressure dressing, uses pressure of -110 to -125 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.
    *   Uses: Chronic non-healing wounds, venous ulcers (debrided, no slough), burns without eschar, bed sores (after debridement), diabetic ulcers (without osteomyelitis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. It promotes healing by increasing blood flow to the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Bed Sores/Pressure Sores**:
    *   Most common sites: Ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   Caused by constant pressure > 30 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
    *   **Staging (latest classification)**:
        *   **Stage 1**: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin (red/maroon, does not whiten on pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
        *   **Stage 2**: Partial thickness skin loss with exposed dermis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
        *   **Stage 3**: Full thickness skin loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
        *   **Stage 4**: Full thickness skin and tissue loss, muscle exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
    *   **Management**:
        *   Grade 1: Offloading pressure (water mattress, repositioning every 2 hours when lying down, sitting up every 10 mins when wheelchair-bound), adequate nutrition, keeping tissue dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
        *   Grade 2 & 3: Debridement, VAC dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
        *   Grade 4: Debridement, often requires flap cover due to large defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Burn Injury Treatment**:
    *   For Grade 3 and 4 burns, the best treatment is debridement followed by split thickness skin grafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Wound Healing Intentions**:
    *   **Primary Intention**: Wound sutured immediately, minimal granulation, good scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
    *   **Secondary Intention**: Wound left open, heals by increased granulation tissue, gradual shrinkage, takes longer, poor scar, risk of hypertrophic scars/keloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
    *   **Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure)**: Wound initially left open (e.g., due to contamination), then sutured later (e.g., after 5 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Keloids vs. Hypertrophic Scars**:
    *   **Keloid**: Grows *beyond* the boundary of the original scar, does not settle with time/pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Common sites: sternum, shoulder, earlobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. Management: intralesional steroid injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
    *   **Hypertrophic Scar**: Remains *within* the boundary of the scar, settles down with time and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Delving Injury**: Extensive skin loss, often with unhealthy muscle. Best treatment is debridement with flap closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for gas gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

    *   **TRALI (Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury)**: Major cause of death post-transfusion, involves antibodies against HLA antigens, causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray within 6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
    *   **Massive Blood Transfusion**: Defined as >10 units in 24 hours, or entire circulating blood volume replaced in 24 hours, or >4 units in 1 hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
        *   Complications: Coagulation abnormalities (leading cause of death), alkalosis (due to citrate toxicity), hypothermia, citrate toxicity, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia (citrate chelates calcium), hypomagnesemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. Hypokalemia is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Types of Hemorrhage**:
    *   **Primary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *during* surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
    *   **Reactionary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *within 24 hours* post-surgery, due to slippage of a knot or dislodgement of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
    *   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Occurs *7-14 days* post-surgery, due to sloughing of a vessel wall secondary to infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Fluid Composition**: Ringer Lactate (Hartmann's solution) contains sodium (131), potassium (5), calcium (2), chloride (111), and lactate (29) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

### Nutrition Support
*   **Enteral Nutrition (RI Tube/NG Tube)**:
    *   Nasogastric tube length is measured from the tip of the nose to the ear lobule to the xiphoid sternum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
    *   Ideally inserted in a sitting position with the neck slightly flexed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
    *   Complications: Diarrhea, aspiration pneumonitis, tube blockade/displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. Hyperglycemia can occur due to overfeeding; hypoglycemia is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.
*   **Gastrostomy/Jejunostomy**: Methods for enteral nutrition. PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) involves endoscopically guiding tube insertion into the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.
*   **TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition)**:
    *   **Monitoring**:
        *   Weight measured daily (earliest sign of overfeeding is increased weight gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
        *   Serum electrolytes measured daily until stable, then weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
        *   Vitamin levels checked weekly to fortnightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
        *   Daily pulse, BP, temperature, and fluid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.
    *   **Optimal Central Line for TPN**: Subclavian vein is preferred due to the least risk of infection and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
    *   **Nutritional Regime for End-Stage Renal Disease**: Low volume, high calorie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.
    *   **Refeeding Syndrome**: Occurs when chronically malnourished patients receive rapid nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
        *   Key electrolyte abnormality: Hypophosphatemia (driver abnormality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>, also hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
        *   Prevention: Thiamine supplementation, gradually building up nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
        *   Risk factors: BMI < 16, unintentional weight loss > 15% in 3-6 months, little/no nutritional intake for >10 days, low baseline potassium/phosphate/magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
        *   Leading cause of death: Arrhythmias and congestive heart failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
    *   **Complications of TPN**: Central line related sepsis (most common), hyperglycemia, weight gain, cholestasis/liver dysfunction (requires stopping TPN, sometimes lipid-free solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., zinc) and refeeding syndrome can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is often referred to as a "little brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, highlighting its significant autonomy. This is why the concept of "gut feelings" is considered very true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Independence**: The ENS can function independently of the brain and spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Influence**: It is not exclusively under the influence of nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Gastrointestinal hormones like gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, and serotonin can also activate the enteric nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Plexus Location**: The Myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus is located between the longitudinal and circular muscles, not in the lamina propria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Connections to Autonomic Nervous System

The vagus nerve is not the *only* efferent pathway from the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The ENS interacts with both the parasympathetic (via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic nervous systems (through prevertebral ganglia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the [[autonomic_nervous_system_functions | autonomic nervous system]] connect to the [[central_nervous_system_examination_techniques | central nervous system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

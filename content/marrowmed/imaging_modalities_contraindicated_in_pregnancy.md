## General Considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>

Certain imaging modalities are generally avoided in pregnancy due to potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. However, it's important to note that "avoided" does not always mean "absolutely contraindicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. In rare circumstances where a procedure is absolutely essential, an X-ray or CT scan may be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The total radiation exposure from these procedures is often less than the maximum permissible radiation exposure during pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The maximum permissible radiation exposure in pregnancy is **five rads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Most Teratogenic Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>

The most teratogenic period for fetal development is the embryonic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This period extends from **3 weeks to 8 weeks after fertilization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Absolutely Contraindicated Imaging Modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>

Some investigations are **absolutely contraindicated** during pregnancy:
*   **Gadolinium MRI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>
*   Any investigation involving a **contrast agent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>
*   **Radioactive iodine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>

## Imaging Modalities to be Avoided (with exceptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>

*   **CT Scan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>
*   **X-ray** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>

## MRI Compatibility of Devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>

When considering MRI during pregnancy, it is important to know which devices are MRI compatible:
*   **MRI Compatible Devices**:
    *   Nexplanon implant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
    *   Copper IUCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>
    *   Metallic sutures (e.g., from a Cesarean section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>
    *   New pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>
    *   New intracranial clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
*   **MRI Non-Compatible Devices**:
    *   Cochlear implant (MRI is contraindicated if present) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>
    *   Old pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
    *   Old intracranial clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>

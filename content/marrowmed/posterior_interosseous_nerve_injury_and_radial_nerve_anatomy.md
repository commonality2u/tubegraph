The [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] is a significant nerve in the upper limb, and injuries to its branches, particularly the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), can lead to specific functional deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Radial Nerve Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

The [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] originates in the axilla and runs posterior to the humerus, wrapping around the spiral groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. It then perforates the lateral intermuscular septum to come anteriorly into the anterior compartment of the arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. In front of the lateral condyle of the humerus, the [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] divides into two main branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>:
*   **Superficial Sensory Branch**: This branch passes under the brachioradialis muscle and extends to supply a specific area of the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Deep Branch**: This branch wraps around the radial head and enters the posterior compartment of the forearm, which is the extensor compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. At this point, its name changes from the deep branch of the [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>

The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a pure motor nerve, meaning it has no sensory supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It is primarily responsible for the extension of the fingers and the thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN) Injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

When the posterior interosseous nerve is injured, a patient will experience specific motor deficits without any sensory loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Motor Deficit**: The patient will be unable to extend their fingers and thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This includes the inability to extend the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Wrist Extension**: Crucially, wrist extension is spared in PIN palsy because the extensor carpi radialis longus, which is the first wrist extensor, is supplied by the [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] before it branches into the PIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Therefore, the patient will be able to extend their wrist but not their fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Sensory Deficit**: There is no sensory deficit associated with PIN injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Differentiating PIN Palsy from High Radial Nerve Palsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

[[Nerve injuries in neck anatomy | Nerve injuries]] can occur at multiple locations along the [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. It is important to differentiate PIN palsy from a high [[Muscle and nerve anatomy | radial nerve]] palsy, which is more common and typically occurs where the nerve is injured in the spiral groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

This article discusses the [[radiology_of_urolithiasis_and_gallbladder_calculi | radiological signs and treatment of renal calculi]], often presenting as acute renal colic.

## Acute Renal Colic: Initial Presentation and Suspicion
Acute renal colic is often suspected clinically when a patient presents with acute lumbar region pain that typically radiates from the loin to the groin, sometimes accompanied by burning or frequent micturition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

## Initial Investigations and Findings
The initial investigation most commonly performed for suspected acute renal colic is ultrasound (USG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. USG is the [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | investigation of choice for detection of hydronephrosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Historically, or if USG is unavailable, an X-ray KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) was performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, X-ray KUB has poor sensitivity for detecting calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | Radiological Signs of Renal Calculi]]
*   **X-ray KUB**
    *   Renal calculus may be directly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Ureteral calculus would be seen along the ureter's course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   A "staghorn calculus" appears as a cast-like structure completely filling the renal pelvicalyceal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, typically composed of triple phosphate or struvite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **USG**
    *   A calculus appears as a hyperechoic focus with a dense posterior shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   **Non-obstructive renal calculus**: No hydronephrosis (dilation of the renal pelvis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Obstructive renal calculus**: If a calculus dislodges and impacts in the ureter, it causes obstruction, leading to dilated pelvicalyceal system (hydronephrosis) and a dilated ureter (hydro-ureter) <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Best Diagnostic Investigation
The best [[investigation_of_choice_for_renal_calculi | diagnostic investigation or investigation of choice for renal/ureteric calculi]] is a non-contrast CT KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Contrast material is generally not required to visualize calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | CT Findings]]
*   **Renal or Bladder Calculi**: Directly visible on CT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Jackstone Calculus**: A calculus within the urinary bladder that takes a peculiar, star-like shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Soft Tissue Rim Sign**: For a ureteric calculus, an edematous ureteral wall surrounds the calculus on all sides, appearing as a soft tissue rim around the central calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Types of Renal Calculi
*   **Most Common**: Calcium oxalate calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Hardest**: Cystine calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These are difficult to treat with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) because they are hard and do not fragment easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Radiolucent Calculi**: Not visible on X-rays. These include pure uric acid calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, certain medication calculi (e.g., indinavir calculi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, or pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **CT Occult Calculi**: Not seen even on CT scans. These include indinavir calculi and pure matrix calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Treatment Modalities and Related [[radiological_signs_and_their_significance_in_clinical_diagnosis | Radiological Signs]]
*   **Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube (PCN)**: A tube passed percutaneously into the kidney to drain urine, typically in cases of large obstructing calculi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be performed to retrieve the calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)**: Used to fragment large calculi into smaller pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Double J Stent (DJ Stent)**: Placed after ESWL to prevent smaller fragments from impacting the ureter and to help drain urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. It has a J-loop in the renal pelvis and another J-loop in the bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Steinstrasse Appearance**: Smaller calculus fragments that line up along the length of a double J stent, resembling a "stone street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Ureteroscopy**: A procedure used to treat calculi, fragment them, and retrieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Complications of Obstructive Uropathy
Obstructive uropathy due to renal calculi can lead to several complications:
*   **Acute Pyelonephritis**: An infected, inflamed kidney, characterized by fever, elevated leukocyte count, pyuria, and on CT, a markedly enlarged kidney with heterogeneous enhancement and perinephric fat stranding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Emphysematous Pyelonephritis**: A severe form of renal infection, typical in diabetics and immunocompromised patients, caused by air-forming microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. CT shows extensive dirty black mottling (air) interspersed within the renal parenchyma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis (XGPN)**: Occurs due to chronic renal calculus disease with superimposed infection (typically *Proteus* or *E.coli*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. It presents with a central dense calculus and multiple round collections in the renal parenchyma, resembling a "bear paw" sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

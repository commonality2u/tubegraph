Dr. Rohan Kelal, who secured an All India Rank (AIR) 7 in the INICET November 2024 examination, has chosen neurosurgery as his desired specialization. He aims to pursue a six-year neurosurgery course at NIMHANS, demonstrating significant perseverance through three attempts at the INICET exam to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Path to Neurosurgery

Originally, Dr. Rohan, an undergraduate from JIPMER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, planned to pursue USMLE and even took Step 1 in his third year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. However, during his fourth year and internship, he decided to focus on neurosurgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He realized that the USMLE path was not practical for this specific branch, leading him to shift his focus to Indian entrance exams like INICET and NEET PG during his internship period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Motivation and Inspiration

Dr. Rohan's decision to pursue neurosurgery was deeply influenced by a personal incident involving his grandfather. His grandfather, who has advanced Parkinson's disease, fell and subsequently developed weakness on his left side. A CT scan revealed a subdural bleed, which is described as a "classic textbook description" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

He was amazed by the significant improvement in his grandfather's life post-surgery, which solidified his resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Already interested in the brain since childhood, his options were initially [[clinical_implications_of_cranial_nerve_injuries | neurology]] or neurosurgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The incident with his grandfather fixed his decision on neurosurgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Further reinforcing his choice, Dr. Rohan had a two-week elective in neurosurgery during his internship, where he observed various surgeries, finding the field very appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

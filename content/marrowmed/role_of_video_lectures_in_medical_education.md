Dr. Mayank, who scored 252 marks in the FMG exam, highlights the significant [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | role of video lectures]] in his medical education and preparation for the FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. His journey began early, emphasizing the long-term benefits of consistent engagement with digital learning tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

## Early Adoption of Marrow Videos
Dr. Mayank started preparing for the FMG exam from his second year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. He primarily used [[use_of_marrow_videos_for_medical_education | Marrow]] as his sole resource for all subjects from his second year onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:63">[01:33:63]</a>. This early start allowed him to build a strong foundation over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

## Benefits of Marrow Video Lectures
Dr. Mayank found the [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | Marrow video lectures]] to be highly beneficial due to their depth and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:60">[01:47:60]</a>. He noted that while some might perceive the information in [[marrow_video_lectures_and_their_effectiveness | Marrow's videos]] as too extensive, this depth provided significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>.

### Conceptual Understanding
Unlike traditional book-based learning, Dr. Mayank relied solely on [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] for his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:36">[02:02:36]</a>. He stressed that [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] are "absolutely necessary" because without a strong grasp of concepts, it is impossible to tackle the exam questions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">[02:09:03]</a>.

### Subject-Specific Impact
Dr. Mayank particularly praised Dr. Rakesh's medicine lectures, stating that they were so well-explained that they sparked his interest in the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. These conceptual [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] provided a comprehensive understanding, making it unnecessary to refer to large textbooks like Harrison's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>.

### Integrated Learning
The integrated nature of medicine lectures, covering pharmacology, pathology, physiology, and even community medicine, helped Dr. Mayank make other subjects easier to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:06">[03:37:06]</a>. He found that studying in an [[benefits_of_integrated_video_lectures_and_notes | integrated way]] through these videos was highly advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:56">[03:50:56]</a>. Other notable teachers included Sakshi Ma'am and Rohan Sir for their excellent gynecology and surgery lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:81">[04:00:81]</a>.

## Integration with Other Study Methods
Dr. Mayank's study routine involved watching [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] daily and then immediately tackling related questions from the question bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:09">[04:38:09]</a>. He initially tried making his own notes but found it more efficient to print Marrow's digital notes and supplement them with information gleaned from question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:65">[06:21:65]</a>.

His long-term strategy involved:
1.  Watching all the main videos up to the fifth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:33">[06:47:33]</a>.
2.  Utilizing [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | rapid revision videos]] to consolidate knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:21">[06:54:21]</a>.
3.  Adding key points from main [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] and question banks into his rapid revision notes, making them his final study material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:69">[06:56:69]</a>.

## Advice on Video Usage
Dr. Mayank advises juniors that the main thing is to watch the [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | video lectures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:44">[12:28:44]</a>. Achieving a high score requires not just revision, but thorough engagement with the initial comprehensive videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

He strongly refutes the idea that one can rely solely on [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | short-form courses or revision videos]] for comprehensive preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:07">[13:10:07]</a>. He likens [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | revision videos]] to "recaps" in a web series â€“ they only make sense if you've watched the full episodes and understood the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:07">[13:56:07]</a>. Without building a strong base from the [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | main videos]], revision videos will not provide the necessary conceptual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:08">[13:43:08]</a>.

> "you should read the pdf bakul so I will give you the same thing or I mean if you are watching any series then watch the video When you watch, after one, two or three episodes, there is a recap that what has happened till now, so those recaps are revision videos, which means they are just recapping the information that they already discuss in the regular video, so if you want to understand the whole show just by watching the recap, if you want to understand all the characters, then that is not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:42">[13:48:42]</a>

This analogy underscores that [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | main videos]] establish the foundational knowledge, without which [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | rapid revision]] is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:08">[13:43:08]</a>. He concludes that for an "amazing score," consistent effort in watching regular [[role_of_video_resources_in_understanding_complex_medical_subjects | videos]] and diligently solving the entire question bank is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

[[Role of Marrow in exam success]]

Dr. Bhavik Chrani, who secured an "unbelievable amazing rank of rank 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> in the INI CET May 2023 exam on his first attempt, attributes a significant part of his success to [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]].

### Early Engagement with [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]]
Dr. Bhavik began using [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]] from his second professional year, initially by watching the main videos after a friend's referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He quickly identified [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]] as a valuable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

He advises juniors to start using [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]] "as early as possible, even in the first prof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. An early start provides an "edge over others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> and helps students "get familiarized with your pattern of studying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Key Components of [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]] Utilized
Dr. Bhavik emphasized that the main videos, [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams|question bank]], and [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|Grand Tests (GTs)]] were crucial to his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Additionally, he found the revision videos (across various editions like 5, 6, 6.5, and 8) and MCQ discussion videos highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He utilized "every single possibility that could have been used in Maro app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

#### [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness|Video Lectures]]
Dr. Bhavik completed all [[Marrow video lectures and their effectiveness|Marrow video lectures]] by the end of his third professional year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. He particularly praised how difficult subjects like Pathology and Surgery were made simple by the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Even without significant clinical exposure in college, he learned most things through the videos, which have a "very clinical approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Regarding new editions of [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]], he chose to focus on revision videos and MCQ discussion videos rather than re-watching all main videos, which proved sufficient for his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

#### [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams|Question Bank]]
He began seriously engaging with the [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams|question bank]] in his third professional year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Initially, his approach was "patchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, but in his fourth professional year, he "reseted the question bank" and completed it in a "systemwise manner" (subject-wise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

His advice is to "solve the question bank side by side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> while watching main videos and to "keep giving regular subject wise test at a monthly interval or a fortnightly interval" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For revision, he relied primarily on "questions, questions and questions" from the [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams|question bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

#### [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|Grand Tests (GTs)]]
Dr. Bhavik started taking [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|GTs]] towards the end of his third professional year and became consistent from his fourth professional year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He increased his frequency from once a month to every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

##### Reviewing GTs
Reviewing [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|GTs]] was "the most hectic part but that is also the most important part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. He reviewed all incorrect and skipped questions, and briefly glanced at correct ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This meant he was effectively revising all 19 subjects every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

##### Approach to Questions in GTs
Initially, he left many questions, but as he gained experience, he became "very aggressive in my approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, realizing his thought process was often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In the INI CET, he marked 195 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. He found that practicing [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|GTs]] helped him understand his thinking process and the probability of marking correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

For tricky questions, he advises marking them for review, moving on, and returning later, as a "different point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. His key strength was "dueling out options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, which improved both speed and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

##### GT Analytics
He found GT analytics helpful initially to identify weaker subjects and areas needing more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

#### Other Tests and Modules
Dr. Bhavik solved all available tests in the [[Marrow for medical exam preparation|Marrow]] app, including subject-wise tests, GTs, mini-tests, and "all the previous years" GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He believed that even with pattern changes, "the topics remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, so older GTs were still useful for content mastery. He used the newer GTs for familiarizing with the latest pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

He noted that he should have started using custom modules earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Importance of Consistency and Confidence
Dr. Bhavik highlighted that "consistency is the only thing that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> in this journey, despite it being difficult and frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Starting early also helps in finding one's unique learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. His good preparation contributed to his calmness during the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, with his rank in the last [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively|Marrow GT]] (around 60-70) providing confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

His advice regarding mistakes is that students "should make mistakes in the question bank but not with the studies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. He also recommends overcoming the "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) on new editions if the main videos have been completed once, and instead focusing on revision and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

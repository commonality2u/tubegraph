The brain stem is a critical structure connecting the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord. Its anatomy can be examined from both its ventral and dorsal aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Ventral Aspect of the Brain Stem

The ventral (front) aspect of the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] reveals how [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves emerge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Parts of the Ventral Brain Stem

*   **Midbrain**:
    *   **Cerebral Peduncle**: A part of the midbrain, also known as the Crus Cerebri, contains descending tracts from the cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is the ventral part of the midbrain through which these tracts pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
    *   **Interpeduncular Fossa**: This fossa is located between the two cerebral peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It contains mammillary bodies and the infundibulum of the pituitary gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Pons**: The ventral aspect of the pons contains numerous nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Medulla Oblongata**: On the ventral aspect of the medulla oblongata, two major elevations help in its identification:
    *   **Olive**: An elevation formed by the inferior olivary nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   **Pyramid**: Contains the corticospinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Cranial Nerves Emerging from the Ventral Brain Stem

The emergence points of [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerves]] from the ventral [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] are distinctive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>:

*   **Third Cranial Nerve (Oculomotor Nerve)**: The only nerve seen emerging from the cerebral peduncle, specifically from the interpeduncular fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear Nerve)**: Although it emerges from the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect of the brain stem]], it is also visible from the ventral aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It is the thinnest [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Fifth Cranial Nerve (Trigeminal Nerve)**: The only nerve emerging from the ventral surface of the pons, appearing as two components (thicker sensory, thinner motor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Sixth (Abducens), Seventh (Facial), and Eighth (Vestibulocochlear) Cranial Nerves**: These three nerves emerge from the pontomedullary junction, the point where the pons meets the medulla oblongata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Ninth (Glossopharyngeal), Tenth (Vagus), and Eleventh (Accessory) Cranial Nerves**: These nerves emerge just lateral or posterolateral to the olive in the medulla oblongata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 11th nerve includes a spinal accessory component originating from the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Twelfth Cranial Nerve (Hypoglossal Nerve)**: This nerve emerges as multiple rootlets between the pyramid and the olive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Clinical Significance (Ventral Aspect)

Identifying the [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] exit points on the ventral [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] is crucial for clinical diagnosis. For instance, injury to the third nerve can lead to ipsilateral ptosis or divergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, while injury to the sixth nerve (at the pontomedullary junction) can cause convergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Dorsal Aspect of the Brain Stem

The [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect of the brain stem]] is typically viewed after the cerebellum is removed, exposing the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Features of the Dorsal Brain Stem

*   **Fourth Ventricle**: The dorsal aspect of the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] forms the floor of the fourth ventricle, also known as the rhomboid fossa due to its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Midbrain Colliculi**: In the midbrain section, four rounded prominences collectively called the Corpora Quadrigemina are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>:
    *   **Superior Colliculus**: Involved in the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | visual pathway]] and connected to the lateral geniculate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   **Inferior Colliculus**: Involved in the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory pathway]] and connected to the medial geniculate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Geniculate Bodies**: Located behind the thalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>:
    *   **Medial Geniculate Body**: Part of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | auditory pathway]] (M for Music/Medial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   **Lateral Geniculate Body**: Part of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | visual pathway]] (L for Light/Lateral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Cerebellar Peduncles**: The superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles form part of the boundaries of the fourth ventricle, converging downward and upward respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The middle cerebellar peduncle, belonging to the pons, does not significantly contribute to the fourth ventricle's boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Cranial Nerves Emerging from the Dorsal Brain Stem

*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear Nerve)**: This is the only [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] that emerges from the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect of the brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Floor of the Fourth Ventricle (Rhomboid Fossa)

The floor of the fourth ventricle displays distinct anatomical features:

*   **Midline Sulcus**: A central groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Sulcus Limitans**: A prominent sulcus lateral to the midline, embryologically important as it divides the neural tube into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>:
    *   **Medial Area (Basal Plate)**: All motor areas are located medial to the sulcus limitans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   **Lateral Area (Alar Plate)**: All sensory areas are located lateral to the sulcus limitans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Elevations (Motor Nuclei Medial to Sulcus Limitans)**:
    *   **Facial Colliculus**: The most prominent elevation, formed by the facial nerve fibers surrounding the deep-seated sixth (abducens) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Hypoglossal Triangle**: Located below the facial colliculus, housing the hypoglossal nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   **Vagal Triangle**: Situated further below, containing the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Elevations (Sensory Nuclei Lateral to Sulcus Limitans)**:
    *   **Vestibular Triangle**: Located on the lateral side, containing the vestibular nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Cranial Nerve Nuclei in the Floor of the Fourth Ventricle

The [[cranial_nerves_emergence_from_the_brain_stem | cranial nerve]] nuclei present in the floor of the fourth ventricle include the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Clinical Significance (Dorsal Aspect)

If a question asks about the consequences of injury to the facial colliculus (e.g., due to a tumor), the primary structure affected would be the seventh [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy | nerve]] (facial nerve) fibers that surround the sixth nucleus, leading to lower motor neuron lesion signs affecting muscles of facial expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. While the sixth nucleus is deep to it, the facial nerve fibers are affected first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

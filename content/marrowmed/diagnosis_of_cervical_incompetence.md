[[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | Cervical insufficiency]], also known as cervical incompetence, refers to the spontaneous dilation of the cervix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Normally, the internal os (the opening of the cervix into the uterus) is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In cases of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]], the internal os automatically dilates, leading to recurrent second-trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

The hallmark of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] is a history of painless, recurrent second-trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These abortions are characteristically painless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical incompetence]] can be made based on either the patient's history or an ultrasound examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### History-Based Diagnosis

*   **Two or More Painless Second-Trimester Abortions:** If a patient provides a history of two or more painless second-trimester abortions, this is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In such cases, no further investigations are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Ultrasound-Based Diagnosis

*   **Single Painless Second-Trimester Abortion:** If there is a history of only one painless second-trimester abortion, a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is necessary to measure the cervical length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Cervical Length:** [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | Cervical insufficiency]] is diagnosed if the length of the cervix is less than or equal to 2.5 cm on TVUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A normal pregnant female's cervical length is typically 4 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Investigation of Choice:** Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is considered the investigation of choice for [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical incompetence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Cervical Shape Changes:** As the cervix dilates due to insufficiency, its shape changes progressively:
    *   Normally, the cervix appears T-shaped on ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Upon dilation, it becomes Y-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Further dilation leads to a V-shaped appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Ultimately, the cervix dilates and becomes part of the lower uterine segment, taking on a U-shaped appearance (also known as "taking up of cervix") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. For [[cervical_insufficiency_and_incompetence | cervical insufficiency]], the cervix typically becomes U-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

*   **Coincidental Finding:** If a pregnant female has no history of abortion but her cervical length is less than 2.5 cm, this is generally considered a coincidental finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In this scenario, [[Cervical Circlage Techniques and Indications | cervical circlage]] is not indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

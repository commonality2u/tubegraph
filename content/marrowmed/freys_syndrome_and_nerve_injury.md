Freys syndrome is a condition characterized by flushing, sweating, and a burning sensation on the face, typically occurring on one side and during meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This syndrome is a clear case of post-traumatic nerve injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Cause and Involved Nerve
Freys syndrome most commonly occurs after [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | parotid gland surgery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The primary nerve involved in this condition is the auriculotemporal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Auriculotemporal Nerve
The auriculotemporal nerve is frequently injured during parotid gland surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It functions as a secretomotor nerve, supplying the parotid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve, specifically originating from its posterior division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Mechanism of Symptoms
When the auriculotemporal nerve is injured during surgery, its regenerating fibers can aberrantly fuse with other nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Most commonly, it fuses with the great auricular nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The great auricular nerve supplies the skin and sweat glands over the parotid region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Less commonly, it can fuse with the buccal nerve or the lesser occipital nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This misdirection of nerve fibers causes the symptoms observed in Freys syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. When salivation typically occurs during a meal, the misrouted parasympathetic fibers stimulate sweat glands or cause flushing in areas supplied by the great auricular, buccal, or lesser occipital nerves, leading to sweating and burning sensations in regions like the anterior cheek, parotid region, or behind the auricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The Rotterdam criteria are a set of diagnostic guidelines used to identify Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. These criteria are considered straightforward and cover expected topics for examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Diagnostic Criteria
According to the Rotterdam criteria, a provisional diagnosis of PCOS is made if **any two** of the following three criteria are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>:

1.  **Increased Androgen Levels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
    *   Manifested as hirsutism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   Confirmed by biochemical tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, such as increased testosterone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

2.  **Ovulatory Dysfunction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
    *   Evidenced by oligomenorrhea (delayed periods) or amenorrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

3.  **Polycystic Appearance on Ultrasound** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    *   Presence of 12 or more follicles (each 2-9 mm in size) in an ovary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, an ovarian volume of 10 cc or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

> [!Note] Ultrasound Criteria Update
> While Rotterdam criteria specify "more than equal to 12 follicles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, recent guidelines from European and American societies suggest "more than equal to 20 follicles" for a polycystic ovary appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. However, Rotterdam still adheres to the 12-follicle criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Exclusions
Several factors are *not* criteria for diagnosing PCOS according to Rotterdam guidelines:
*   Obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
*   LH:FSH ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Menometrorrhagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
*   Necklace pattern of follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> (Rotterdam does not specify arrangement around the periphery of the ovary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   The Rotterdam criteria provide a **provisional diagnosis** of PCOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Enlarged ovaries on imaging are often indicative of PCOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis
Once a provisional diagnosis of PCOS is made, it is crucial to differentiate it from [[understanding_common_conditions_related_to_endocrinology | late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The screening test for this is 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

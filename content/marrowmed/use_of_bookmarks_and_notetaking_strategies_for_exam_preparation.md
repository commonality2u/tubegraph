Dr. Shashwat, who secured Rank 2 in the INICT exam, shared his [[effective_notetaking_and_study_techniques | preparation strategies]], emphasizing the critical roles of notetaking and effective use of study resources like question banks and bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Notetaking Strategies

Dr. Shashwat employed different notetaking methods depending on the subject and time available during his medical studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Handmade Notes
He began making handmade notes at the start of his third professional year (2022) for subjects like ENT, Ophthalmology, and PSM (Preventive and Social Medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: While watching videos, he would pause to understand the content, then copy it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Time Commitment**: Making handmade notes definitely took more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Retention**: Despite the time, retention was "much better" for subjects studied with handmade notes, such as surgery, OBG, and medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. If time permits, this approach is "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Printed Notes
For subjects studied in his final year and during internship, Dr. Shashwat primarily used printed notes due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. These "readymade notes" could be read along with the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Question Banks (Qbank) and Bookmarks

Dr. Shashwat integrated Qbank practice throughout his [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | exam preparation]], adjusting his approach as needed.

### Qbank Integration
He started solving Qbank questions simultaneously with video watching and note [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revision]] for most topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This reinforced the subject material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. During internship, he focused on completing Qbank for subjects he hadn't covered earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### Qbank Performance and Review
*   **Targets**: He aimed for at least 80%, preferably 90%, correct answers in Qbank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Explanation Review**: He thoroughly read all explanations, particularly for incorrect answers, and reviewed all options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. This helped in [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revision]] and preventing future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Low Scores**: If he consistently scored below 65% in two or three modules of a particular subject (e.g., GI in Surgery), he would go back to his notes to revise the entire subject before attempting more questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. For isolated low scores (outliers), he relied primarily on Qbank explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **Volume**: During internship, he solved around 50 questions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. This volume increased to 100-125 questions per day two to three months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

### Managing Bookmarked Questions
Dr. Shashwat managed bookmarked questions strategically:
*   **Timing**: He focused on bookmarked questions towards the end of his internship, reviewing them subject-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Selection Criteria**: He bookmarked questions he had answered incorrectly or topics he didn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. He prioritized questions with more than 30% correct attempts by other users, avoiding very difficult or experimental questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
*   **Filtering**: He removed questions from his bookmarks once he consistently got them correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

## Overall Revision and [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | Exam Preparation]]
*   **Pearls**: He found "pearls" useful for quick [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revision]], especially for topics he hadn't revised or for scoring systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. He reviewed pearls after solving Qbank questions and reading explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules**: For [[exam_preparation_strategies_and_experiences | exam preparation]], he recommended focusing on "PQ" (Previous Year Questions), "NEET" (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), "clinical questions," "difficulty-based" questions, and "IBQs" (Image-Based Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

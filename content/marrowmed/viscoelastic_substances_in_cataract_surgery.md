Viscoelastic substances are specialized agents used during [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care|cataract surgery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. They are also known as ocular visco surgical devices (OVDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. These substances are polymers that contain glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Function
The primary roles of viscoelastic substances in [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care|cataract surgery]] are:

*   **Maintaining Anterior Chamber Depth:** They are injected to replace the aqueous humor, which helps maintain the depth of the anterior chamber during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This prevents the anterior chamber from collapsing during critical steps, such as capsulorhexis and [[Lens implantation and posterior capsular opacification|intraocular lens (IOL) placement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Protecting Corneal Endothelium:** Viscoelastic substances coat the corneal endothelium from the inside, acting as a barrier that prevents mechanical injury to the endothelium from surgical instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Types of Viscoelastic Substances
There are two main types of viscoelastic substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>:

*   **Cohesive Viscoelastics:**
    *   Have a high molecular weight and low viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
    *   Are easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
    *   Mainly used to maintain the anterior chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Dispersive Viscoelastics:**
    *   Have a low molecular weight and high viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
    *   Used to coat and protect the endothelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
    *   Can be more difficult and time-consuming to remove due to their dispersed nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Both types have distinct functions and are typically used during a routine [[Complications related to surgery and postoperative care|cataract surgery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Post-Surgical Considerations
Although viscoelastic substances are generally inert, they cannot be left behind after surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. If left in large quantities, they can lead to:
*   **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   Increased intraocular pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

The eye's natural state requires aqueous humor or a fluid, so viscoelastics must be removed after the procedure is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

It is important to note that substances like silicone oil, perfluoropropane (C3F8), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are not viscoelastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. These are typically used for the [[Medical and Surgical Management of Vascular Diseases|treatment of retinal detachment]], particularly for pneumatic retinopexy, where they act as tamponading agents to reattach the detached retina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

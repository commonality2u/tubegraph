Dr. Akhil, who secured an All India Rank 6 in the November 2024 INI-CET, emphasizes the crucial role of consistent practice tests and strategic review in his preparation journey. He highlights how these elements were instrumental in maximizing his performance and achieving a top rank in a challenging exam.

## Early Engagement with Questions

Dr. Akhil began his preparation in his third year of MBBS, focusing on making notes and solving questions for specific topics immediately after completing a video lecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This immediate application of knowledge through question solving was a key part of his early strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. He recommends starting to strengthen basic subjects like Pathology, Pharmacology, and Microbiology from the fifth semester itself, as these are crucial throughout MBBS and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Strategic Review of Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. Akhil started taking Grand Tests (GTs) regularly during his internship, a period he describes as hectic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. His review strategy focused primarily on incorrect answers. He would first address the questions he got wrong, ensuring those mistakes were not repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. His philosophy was that there's a 99% chance of repeating a mistake, so focusing on errors is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

> "Whatever you are colouring focus on it again and again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>

He also identified weak topics, especially those from previous years that he didn't know, and would then refer back to his notes to strengthen those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

## Navigating Performance Fluctuations

Dr. Akhil acknowledges that the performance graph during the GT journey is not a constant rise; it's a "roller coaster ride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. Despite instances where scores might not improve, the [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | main thing is to be consistent with efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

He admits to feeling tempted to skip GTs when feeling unprepared or underconfident, fearing a dip in confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. However, even when skipping GTs, he would compensate by taking subject-wise tests to ensure continuous engagement with testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

> "You have to do something, you have to give a test or a subject wise test and a GT, you have to give it consistently because ultimately that will be the main factor that will decide your rank on the examination day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>

He viewed GT scores not as a source of happiness or sadness, but merely as a measurement of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Giving GTs is like [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revising]] all 19 subjects, helping to stay connected with each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>. It also significantly boosts the level of preparation just before the test, simulating the exam environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>.

## The Role of Custom Modules and Question Banks

Dr. Akhil considers the custom module feature of Marrow to be its most useful, offering flexibility and allowing personalized preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>. This feature enabled him to:
-   Focus on specific subjects or topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>.
-   Tackle previous year questions from NEET and AIIMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
-   Incorporate questions with images (clinical tags) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.

He used custom modules to test himself immediately after reading a topic, ensuring he knew what he had covered and what remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>. This systematic approach prevents random studying and helps identify strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. Custom modules also help in customizing which subjects need more focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. If a student consistently gets more than 75% correct in a custom module for a topic, Dr. Akhil believes there's no need to re-read the entire topic, saving valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

## Systematic Progression in Practice

Dr. Akhil recommends a structured approach to practicing questions:
1.  **First Read**: Read notes and solve questions for the specific topic, especially previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. Identify weak topics and refer back to notes, highlighting mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Second Revision Cycle**: Become more subject-wise. Solve previous year question papers for each subject and review mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.
3.  **Later Cycles**: Move to 19-subject grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. This builds confidence, progressing from small blocks (topics) to larger ones (subjects), and finally to the full building (19 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.

This progression ensures a thorough and well-rounded [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_revision | practice question and revision]] strategy, ultimately leading to better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.

## Importance of Belief and Effort

Dr. Akhil stresses that efforts never go to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Even if the immediate result isn't perfect, the accumulated knowledge and practice contribute to future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43:00">[25:43:00]</a>. He encourages students to "believe that my efforts will be successful one day or the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.

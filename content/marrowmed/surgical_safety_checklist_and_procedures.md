This module provides an overview of important concepts in general surgery, focusing on key topics, previous year questions, and strategies for answering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It emphasizes that watching these videos is not a substitute for practicing with a Qbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Practice and discipline are crucial in the months leading up to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Surgical Safety Checklist

The surgical safety checklist comprises three phases: Sign In, Time Out, and Sign Out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Sign In
This phase occurs before the induction of anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. During this phase, checks include patient consent, patient identity, site marking, and allergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Time Out
The Time Out phase happens before the skin incision, preceding the start of surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In this phase, patient details are reconfirmed, the surgeon discusses surgery details, the anesthesia team raises any concerns, and antibiotic prophylaxis administration is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Sign Out
This final phase occurs before the patient leaves the operating room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Key actions include counting instruments and gauze, labeling specimens, and confirming blood loss with the anesthetist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Counting mops and equipment during the Sign Out phase can prevent complications like retaining foreign objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## [[enhanced_recovery_after_surgery_protocols|Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)]] Protocols

[[enhanced_recovery_after_surgery_protocols|ERAS]] protocols are a set of guidelines implemented before, during, and after surgery to ensure faster patient recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Pre-operative
*   Patient counseling is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Mechanical bowel preparation is avoided to prevent fluid and electrolyte imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Solids can be consumed up to 6 hours prior to surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Carbohydrate-rich clear liquids can be given up to 2 hours before surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Intra-operative
*   Minimally invasive techniques are preferred for faster recovery and less pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Long-acting local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Patients should be kept warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   Maintenance IV fluids are administered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two classes of drugs are used to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Post-operative
*   NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) are used for pain management, with opioids reserved for breakthrough pain only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Regular diet needs to be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   IV fluids are discontinued within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Patients are ambulated within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Less and less drains are inserted to facilitate earlier discharge and self-management at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Surgical Procedures and Equipment

### Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy
*   **Positioning**: Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy are typically placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position with the right side elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Complication**: The most common complication is right shoulder tip pain, caused by CO2 retention beneath the right dome of the diaphragm, leading to referred pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### IV Cannula Sizes and Flow Rates
Knowledge of IV cannula sizes and their maximum flow rates is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Orange (14 gauge)**: 240 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Gray (16 gauge)**: 180 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Green (18 gauge)**: 96 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Pink (20 gauge)**: Approximately 60 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Blue (22 gauge)**: 36 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Yellow (24 gauge)**: 20 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Violet (26 gauge)**: 13 ml/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Central Lines
*   **Tip Position**: The tip of a central line should lie in the superior vena cava, just above the right atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. It should not be in the right atrium to avoid arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Post-Procedure**: A chest X-ray is always required after insertion to rule out pneumothorax and confirm tip position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Most Serious Complication**: The most serious complication of central lines is central line infections or central line-related sepsis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Management of Suspected Infection**: If a patient develops fever with chills after fluids are given through a central line, the catheter tip should be removed and sent for culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **PIC Line**: A PIC (Peripherally Inserted Central) line is a peripherally inserted central catheter where the tip lies in the position of a central line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. It is used for patients needing a few cycles of chemotherapy or long-term antibiotic therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Cautery
*   **Cutting Mode**: Characterized by a continuous, low voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Coagulation Mode**: Characterized by an alternating current, high voltage waveform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Monopolar Cautery**: A pencil-like instrument that can be used for both cutting and coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Its usage close to nerves can cause thermal damage and can interfere with cardiac conduction in patients with pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Bipolar Cautery**: A prong-like instrument used only for coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. It is safer near vital nerves and can be used in patients with cardiac pacemakers as it does not cause arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Suturing Techniques and Materials
*   **Horizontal Mattress Suture**: This technique is haemostatic and is used when simple sutures fail to cause eversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. It involves going from one side and returning at the same depth adjacent to the entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Vertical Mattress Suture**: Involves going deep and returning superficially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Subcuticular Suturing**: Cosmetically superior, typically uses Monocryl on a cutting needle (e.g., 3-0 or 4-0 Monocryl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. A cutting or reverse cutting needle is necessary for tough structures like skin, sheath, and fascia to prevent bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Surgical Staplers
*   **Circular Stapler**: Used in procedures like esophagojejunostomy post-total gastrectomy, hemorrhoid surgery, and low anterior resection for sigmoid colon cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
*   **Linear Stapler**: Used in procedures like Zenker's diverticulectomy, side-to-side bowel anastomosis, and sleeve gastrectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

### Surgical Drains
*   **Romovac Drain**: A closed suction drain that creates negative pressure and is a closed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Used after mastectomy, neck dissection, or thyroidectomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Minivac Drain**: A miniature version of the Romovac drain, used for smaller incisions and procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Jackson Pratt Drain**: Also a closed suction drain, characterized by a bulb and a flat tube (as opposed to a cylindrical tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. It can be used intra-abdominally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

### Skin Grafts
*   **Split Thickness Skin Graft**: Identified by "meshing" cuts made to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Nutritional Supply Mechanism**:
    *   **Day 1-2**: Imbibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
    *   **Day 2-4**: Inosculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
    *   **Beyond Day 4**: Neovascularization (formation of new vessels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### VAC Dressing (Vacuum-Assisted Closure)
Also known as negative pressure dressing, it applies a pressure of -110 to -130 mmHg (normally -120 to -125 mmHg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. VAC dressing helps in wound healing by increasing blood flow to the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Uses**:
    *   Chronic non-healing wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
    *   Venous ulcers (after debridement with no slough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   Burn wounds without eschar (after removal of dead tissue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
    *   Bed sores after debridement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
    *   Diabetic ulcers without osteomyelitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Wound Management and Healing

### Southampton Wound Score
A scoring system for wounds:
*   **Grade 0**: Normal healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   **Grade 1**: Normal healing with mild bruising or erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Grade 2**: Erythema plus other signs of inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Grade 3**: Clear discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Grade 4**: Purulent discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Grade 5**: Complete breakdown of tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### ASPSIS Wound Score
Another scoring system where each letter represents a factor:
*   **A**: Additional treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **S**: Serous discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **E**: Erythema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **P**: Purulent discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **S**: Separation of deep tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **I**: Isolation of bacteria from the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **S**: Prolonged stay beyond 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Intraperitoneal Abscess Formation
*   The most common site of intra-peritoneal collection is the pelvis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   If the pelvis is not mentioned, the most common site in a supine patient is Morrison's pouch (hepato-renal pouch of Morrison) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   In an ambulatory patient, the most common site is the pelvis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   The investigation of choice for an abscess is a CECT (Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   Management of an abscess involves pigtail catheter insertion to drain the pus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

### Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Rates
*   **Clean Wounds**: Involve a clean incisional wound, such as thyroid or breast surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Risk of wound infection is 1-2% regardless of antibiotic prophylaxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Clean Contaminated Wounds**: Occur when the GI or GU system is entered without inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Examples include elective cholecystectomy, elective appendectomy, cesarean section, laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy, or prepared bowel surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Risk of infection is 3% with antibiotic prophylaxis and 6-9% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Contaminated Wounds**: Involve entering the GI or GU system with non-purulent inflammation present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Examples include emergency cholecystectomy, emergency appendectomy, or opened bowel in cases of intestinal obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Risk is 6% with antibiotic prophylaxis and 20% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Dirty Wounds**: Characterized by the presence of pus or fecal contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. All abscesses are dirty wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Risk of infection is 7-8% with antibiotic prophylaxis and 20-40% without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

### Burst Abdomen (Wound Dehiscence)
*   Typically presents around the sixth post-operative day with a "salmon fluid sign" (reddish fluid discharge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   Incidence is more common with a midline incision compared to a transverse incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   Incidence increases if Prolene sutures less than four times the length of the wound are used, as this creates more tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   There is *lower* incidence if non-absorbable sutures are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Management**: Temporary measure is a Bota bag or Euro bag laparotomy; definitive measure is re-suturing of the rectus sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Wound Healing Mechanisms
*   **Primary Intention**: Occurs when wounds are sutured, resulting in a good scar with minimal granulation tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Secondary Intention**: Occurs when a wound is left open, leading to increased granulation tissue formation and gradual shrinking, taking a longer period and potentially resulting in a poor scar, hypertrophic scars, or keloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure)**: Involves leaving the wound open initially (e.g., to manage infection) and then suturing it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

### Keloids vs. Hypertrophic Scars
*   **Keloid**: Grows beyond the boundary of the original scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. They do not settle down with time and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. Common sites include the sternum, shoulder, and earlobules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Management involves intralesional steroid injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Hypertrophic Scar**: Remains within the boundary of the original scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. They tend to settle down with time and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

### Bed Sores/Pressure Sores
Caused by constant pressure of more than 30 mmHg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Most Common Sites**: Ischium, followed by greater trochanter, then sacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Staging**:
    *   **Stage 1**: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin (red or maroon skin that doesn't whiten with pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
    *   **Stage 2**: Partial thickness skin loss with exposed dermis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
    *   **Stage 3**: Full thickness skin loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
    *   **Stage 4**: Full thickness skin and tissue loss, with muscle exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Management**:
    *   **Grade 1**: Offloading pressure (e.g., water mattress, changing position every 10 seconds for wheelchair patients, changing position every 2 hours for bedridden patients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Adequate nutritional status and dry tissue are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
    *   **Grade 2 and 3**: Debridement and VAC dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
    *   **Grade 4**: Debridement and sometimes a flap cover for large gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

### Burn Injury Treatment
For Grade 3 and Grade 4 burn injuries, the best treatment is complete debridement followed by split thickness skin grafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## Patient Safety and Critical Care

### Near Miss Events
A near miss event occurs when harm is prevented by timely intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> (e.g., stopping an IV bolus of potassium, which could cause arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>). An adverse event is when harm occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. A no-harm event is an event that shouldn't have occurred but caused no harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Hand Hygiene
Based on the five moments of hand hygiene prescribed by WHO:
*   Hand sanitizer or soap and water should be used before touching a patient, after touching a patient, before a procedure, after exposure to body fluids, and after touching the patient's surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   Soap and water are mandatory when hands are soiled or after visiting the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Pre-operative Optimization
*   Improving nutrient intake for 2 weeks can improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   Smoking cessation shows maximum benefit if done at least 6 to 8 weeks before surgery; 4 weeks is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   Bathing with antiseptic soap solution helps reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   Chronic anemia is better tolerated than acute blood loss because the body has adapted to the lower hemoglobin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Sepsis and Shock

#### QSOFA Score (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)
The QSOFA score includes three factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>:
*   Hypotension (systolic BP < 100 mmHg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   Altered mental status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   Tachypnea (> 22 breaths/minute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

#### Sepsis Six Criteria
Six actions to be performed within one hour for a septic patient ("give three and take three") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>:
*   **Give Three**: IV fluids, oxygen, antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Take Three**: Blood culture, urine output measurement, lactate measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

#### SIRS Criteria (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome)
SIRS is the body's response to inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Two or more of the following criteria indicate SIRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>:
*   Temperature > 38°C or < 36°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   Heart rate > 90 bpm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

*   Sepsis is defined as SIRS plus a known focus of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

#### Stages of Shock
*   **Class 1 (Early/Compensated)**: No significant changes in parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.
*   **Class 2 (Mild)**: 15-30% blood loss; only pulse rate increases; urine output and respiratory rate are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Class 3 (Moderate)**: 30-40% blood loss; systolic BP starts to fall for the first time; urine output begins to decrease; patients may require blood products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
*   **Class 4 (Severe/Decompensated)**: > 40% blood loss; none of the parameters are recordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

#### Types of Shock
*   **Hypovolemic Shock**: Low cardiac output, low central venous pressure (JVP), and high vascular resistance (vasoconstriction, cold extremities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. MVOS (mixed venous oxygen saturation) is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Distributive (Septic) Shock**: Low vascular resistance (vasodilation, warm extremities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. MVOS is high because tissues cannot utilize oxygen properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
*   **Neurogenic Shock**: Spinal cord transection leads to bradycardia and hypotension; also associated with vasodilation (warm extremities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **Cardiogenic Shock**: High central venous pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. MVOS is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Obstructive Shock**: A type of cardiogenic shock where diastolic filling is impaired (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.

### Blood Transfusion Complications
*   **TACO (Transfusion-Associated Cardiac Overload)**: Presents with breathlessness, puffiness, pedal edema, and high blood pressure immediately after transfusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Chest X-ray is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
*   **TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury)**: A major cause of death post-transfusion, involving antibodies against HLA antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Presents with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, typically within 6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Massive Blood Transfusion**: Defined as > 10 units of blood in 24 hours, replacement of entire circulating blood volume in 24 hours, or > 4 units in 1 hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
    *   **Complications**:
        *   Coagulation abnormalities (leading cause of death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
        *   Alkalosis (more common, due to citrate toxicity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
        *   Hypothermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
        *   Hypocalcemia (due to citrate chelating calcium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
        *   Hypomagnesemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.
        *   Hyperkalemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
        *   Hypokalemia is extremely uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

### Hemorrhage Types
*   **Primary Hemorrhage**: Occurs during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **Reactionary Hemorrhage**: Occurs within 24 hours post-surgery, due to slippage of a knot or dislodgement of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
*   **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Occurs 7 to 14 days post-surgery, due to sloughing of the vessel wall caused by infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

### [[nutritional_support_in_surgical_patients|Nutritional Support]]

#### Enteral Nutrition
*   **RI Tube (Nasogastric Tube) Feeding**: Complications can include diarrhea, aspiration pneumonitis, and tube blockade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. Hyperglycemia due to overfeeding can occur, but hypoglycemia is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.
    *   **Measurement**: Length measured from the tip of the nose to the earlobe to the xiphoid sternum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
    *   **Insertion**: Ideally inserted in a sitting position with the neck slightly flexed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Gastrostomy/PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) Tube**: Used for enteral nutrition, involves creating an opening in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

#### Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)
*   **Monitoring**:
    *   Weight should be measured daily; increased weight gain is an early sign of overfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.
    *   Serum electrolytes should be measured daily until the patient is stable, then weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
    *   Vitamin levels should be checked weekly to fortnightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
    *   Daily pulse, BP, temperature, body weight, and fluid balance are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.
*   **Vein Choice for TPN**: The subclavian vein is preferred for TPN due to the least risk of displacement and catheter-induced infection and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. The femoral vein has the maximum risk of infection and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) is most commonly used due to ease of insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Renal Disease**: For end-stage renal disease, a low-volume, high-calorie nutritional regime is best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

#### Refeeding Syndrome
Occurs when chronically malnourished patients are quickly given nutrition, leading to electrolyte abnormalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Electrolyte Abnormality**: Hypophosphatemia is the primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Thiamine supplementation and gradual nutrition build-up reduce incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Risk Factors**: Patients with BMI < 16, unintentional weight loss > 15% in last 3-6 months, little or no nutritional intake for > 10 days, or low baseline potassium, phosphate, or magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
*   **Leading Cause of Death**: Arrhythmias and congestive heart failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **TPN Complications**: Catheter-induced sepsis is the most common central line complication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Other complications include hyperglycemia, weight gain, and cholestasis (increased bilirubin, LFTs; may require stopping TPN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. Long-term TPN use can lead to liver dysfunction, necessitating lipid-free solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

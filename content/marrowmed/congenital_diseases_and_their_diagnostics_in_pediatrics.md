## Growth Monitoring and Developmental Milestones

Monitoring a child's growth is crucial in pediatrics to identify potential issues like growth failure.

### WHO Growth Curves
The World Health Organization (WHO) provides standardized growth curves used for monitoring growth in children. A growth trajectory that falls below -2 standard deviations on these charts indicates growth failure or faltering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Curve 3 shows growth faltering, with the final value falling below -2 SD, indicating growth failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.</figcaption>

### Schmon's Growth Curves
Schmon's growth curves illustrate the differing growth patterns of various body tissues relative to adult size over age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>:
*   **Curve A (Parabolic)**: Represents brain growth, reaching approximately 90% of adult size by 2 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Curve B (Above 100% then back to 100%)**: Characterizes lymphoid tissues (e.g., tonsils, adenoids, lymph nodes), which can temporarily grow to more than 100% of adult size, typically between 4 to 8 years, before regressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Curve C (Sigmoid)**: Reflects somatic growth, such as height increase, with initial rapid growth, a slower phase, and then another rapid increase after about 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **Curve D (Silent until 10-12 years then rapid increase)**: Illustrates gonadal growth, remaining relatively quiet until 10-12 years before a rapid increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## Congenital Conditions and Their Diagnostics

### Celiac Disease
[[celiac_disease_diagnosis_and_testing | Celiac disease]], also known as gluten hypersensitivity, is suspected in children presenting with lack of weight gain, abdominal pain on eating, and poor eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. A key diagnostic clue is improvement in general condition and weight gain after a gluten-free diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Testing**: Estimation of IgA levels along with anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG) antibody testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Confirmation**: If initial antibody levels are elevated, diagnosis is confirmed with anti-endomysial (anti-EMA) antibody testing or a biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Congenital Toxoplasmosis
Congenital toxoplasmosis, caused by *Toxoplasma gondii*, presents in neonates with a classic triad:
*   Chorioretinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>
*   Diffuse intraparenchymal calcifications in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>
*   Hydrocephalus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>

For diagnosis, IgG antibodies are considered a more sensitive test compared to IgM ELISA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### Rickets (Refractory Types)
Rickets can manifest with bone deformities such as "wind-swept deformity" (varus and valgus deviation of limbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. When serum calcium is normal, phosphate is low, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normal, nutritional rickets (vitamin D deficiency) is unlikely due to the normal PTH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

Refractory rickets require a specific diagnostic approach based on biochemical investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>:
*   **Serum Phosphate**: High levels suggest Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)-associated rickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. Low levels are common in other types.
*   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: Presence of acidosis indicates Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.
*   **PTH Levels**:
    *   High PTH: Seen in vitamin D-dependent rickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
    *   Normal PTH: Indicative of familial hypophosphatemic rickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.

### Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)
CDH is suspected in newborns with respiratory distress, heart sounds shifted to the right hemithorax, and gurgling (intestinal) sounds heard on auscultation of the left thorax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. Radiographic imaging confirms the diagnosis. The most common site of defect is the left posterolateral side, characteristic of Bochdalek hernia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>.

*   **Imaging Differentiation**: Unlike congenital pulmonary adenomatoid malformation (CPAM), where the diaphragm border is well-defined, in CDH, the diaphragm border is typically not appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

### Congenital Pulmonary Adenomatoid Malformation (CPAM)
CPAM, previously known as Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM), is the most common cause of cystic lung disease in newborns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. It presents with respiratory distress and recurrent respiratory infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.

*   **Imaging**: Multiple rounded cysts are present within the lung parenchyma on CT or X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   **Key Differentiation**: A well-defined diaphragm border on imaging helps distinguish CPAM from CDH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.
*   **Management**: Due to the risk of malignancy (sarcoma or carcinoma) in the cystic areas, surgical resection of the malformation is required, ideally before one year of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.

### Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)
IHPS typically presents in neonates around 6 weeks of age with repeated episodes of non-bilious vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. It results from hypertrophy of the circular muscle fibers of the pylorus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis**:
    *   **Ultrasound**: The investigation of choice. Criteria include pyloric muscle thickness greater than 4 mm and pyloric channel length greater than 16 mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>.
    *   **X-ray**: May show a "single bubble sign" in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

### Gaucher Disease
Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and bone pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>.

*   **Diagnosis**: Bone marrow examination reveals macrophages with a distinctive "crumpled tissue paper" appearance, known as Gaucher cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.
*   **Underlying Deficiency**: Deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

### Pompe Disease
Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disorder (Type II) or a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by a deficiency of alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. It presents in infants as a "floppy infant" (extreme hypotonia due to skeletal muscle involvement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>, with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and significant cardiomyopathy due to cardiac muscle involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

*   **Associated Features**: Can also present with macroglossia and feeding difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using acid maltase is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:55:00">[30:55:00]</a>.

Dr. Ravi, who secured Rank 3 in the November INI CET exam, shares his journey and strategies for competitive medical exams, including how he overcame setbacks and improved his performance.

## Persisting Through Setbacks
Dr. Ravi's journey highlights the [[overcoming_challenges_and_persistence_in_achieving_academic_goals | importance of persistence]]. In a previous NEET PG exam, he secured Rank 43, narrowly missing his dream of medicine at a central institute, which closed at Rank 41 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Despite this, he "fought back hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> to achieve Rank 5 in the next NEET PG and then Rank 3 in the November INI CET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Interestingly, his Rank 3 in INI CET was an "accidental rank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> as he had already secured Rank 5 in NEET PG and wasn't planning further exams. The delay in NEET PG counseling and a motivating "reel" from Dr. Rohan Kelkar prompted him to apply for INI CET on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He studied for only six or seven days before the exam, feeling no pressure, which allowed him to approach the exam with an open mind and perform optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences | Exam Preparation Strategies]]
### Marrow Journey & Study Approach
Dr. Ravi began his PG preparation from his third year of MBBS, utilizing Marrow Plan C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. His strategy involved:
*   **Early engagement with subjects**: In his third year, he focused on third-year subjects and parts of final-year subjects (surgery, medicine, OB/GYN, short subjects) to avoid a heavy burden in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Completing syllabus in final year**: He completed all final-year syllabus videos from Marrow by the end of his final year, anticipating limited time during internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Note-taking**: He used a mix of self-made notes (for subjects like surgery and medicine) and Marrow's PDF notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### [[Problemsolving strategies in exams | MCQ Practice]] and [[Importance of consistency in exam preparation | Consistency]]
Dr. Ravi emphasized the role of MCQ practice in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:
*   **Timing of MCQ practice**: He did most of his MCQ practice in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. On day one of his internship, he reset all completed modules in the Marrow app and started solving them again, including first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. By the end of his internship, he had completed about 80% of all MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Difference in approach (pre-final vs. internship)**:
    *   **Pre-final/final year**: He dedicated more time to reading all explanations and noting down key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Internship**: With less time, he was selective, focusing on revising from his notes if he got an MCQ wrong, rather than reading every explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   [[Importance of consistency in exam preparation | Maintaining consistency]]: He treated MCQ solving as a daily challenge, aiming for a minimum of four or five modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His approach was to read a topic and then immediately solve its corresponding module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This method provided:
    *   **Comprehensive review**: Understanding the topic and how MCQs could be formed from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   **Reinforcement**: "Hammers the topic in your brain" preventing easy forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Attempt strategy**: In exams, he aimed to attempt 190-195 questions out of 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Grand Test (GT) Strategy and Overcoming Stagnation
Dr. Ravi started taking GTS from his first month of internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, with a frequency of one GT every two to three weeks, adjusting based on his internship postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

His [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | GT analysis strategy]] involved:
1.  Reviewing incorrect questions first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  Then, reviewing skipped questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
3.  Finally, reviewing questions he guessed correctly, to understand the underlying concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   He focused 3-4 hours on reviewing incorrect, skipped, and guessed questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   He only briefly reviewed correct questions if time permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   He ensured to revise the GT material on the same day without delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

#### Addressing GT Score Stagnation
Dr. Ravi experienced phases where his GT scores stagnated. Initially, he was stuck at 150 correct questions after starting around 130-140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. He realized his mistake was postponing certain subjects like Community Medicine and FMT, waiting for updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
To overcome this, he:
*   **Prioritized weak subjects**: He focused on subjects where he consistently scored low percentiles, like Community Medicine and FMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Focused study**: He used the Q-bank to identify frequently asked topics within those weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
This strategy helped him surpass the 150-mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He later faced another stagnation at 165 but continued giving more GTS, eventually reaching above 170 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This highlights the importance of facing "demons" or weak subjects early in [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Revision Strategies
Dr. Ravi completed 3-4 revisions of the entire 19-subject syllabus in the last three months before NEET PG, taking only 20-25 days for each complete revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. His key revision strategy was:
*   **"20th Notebook"**: From day one of his internship, he created a separate notebook to write down factual things or concepts he knew he would easily forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He consciously excluded common-sense knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This allowed him to condense subjects (e.g., surgery notes fitting into 60 pages) and revise them quickly (e.g., surgery in 8-9 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. These concise notes were then revised just one week before the examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Bookmark management**: For bookmarked MCQs, he would try to solve them again without seeing the answer. If correct, he removed the bookmark. For factual questions, he would write them down in his 20th notebook for quick revision before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Utilizing Marrow Pearls
Marrow Pearls were particularly helpful during his internship, especially during long shifts in the emergency room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. He used them for quick revision of subjects and to focus on important, highlighted concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Final Advice for Aspirants
Dr. Ravi's parting thoughts underscore crucial aspects of [[the_role_of_focused_study_and_revision_in_competitive_exams | competitive exam preparation]]:
*   **Revision is paramount**: "Only the revision that matters in the final examination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. He emphasizes that depth of study matters less than the number of revisions, as medicine is over 80% factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Plan revision from day one**: It's impossible to revise 19 subjects one month before the exam from main notes; concise notes are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **GTS are irreplaceable**: Grand Tests are critical for success, and not taking them means "you are not going in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Study main subjects first**: It's crucial to read main subjects before moving to revision videos or filtered content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

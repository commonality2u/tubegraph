Dr. Pushwand, who secured Rank 9 in INI CET, shares his journey and strategies for preparing for competitive medical exams. His primary source of preparation was Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Achieving a Top Rank

Dr. Pushwand was extremely elated and rechecked his result multiple times upon learning he secured a single-digit rank, as it was beyond his expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In a previous attempt, he had achieved a decent rank of around 300-370 without proper study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This time, after studying properly, he aimed for a position in PJ medicine or a central institute, but a single-digit rank was a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Influential Faculties and Subjects

Several faculties played a significant role in Dr. Pushwand's [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation]]:
*   **Medicine**: Rakesh Nayer's videos ignited his interest in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Pharmacology**: He appreciated the different perspective provided in Marrow's pharmacology videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **ENT**: He liked Manisha ma'am's [[ent_exam_questions_and_strategies | ENT teaching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **OBG**: Saki mam's OBG teaching was also favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Surgery**: Although he generally disliked surgery, Dohan's videos made it tolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Study Approach and Notes

Dr. Pushwand did not use printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. His approach to videos was not linear; he didn't watch them like a marathon from video one to video two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Instead, he would selectively watch videos on specific topics when he needed information or to understand a concept, often linking it with practical knowledge gained from wards or postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This method helped him learn clinically rather than just memorizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## MCQ Practice Strategies

Initially, Dr. Pushwand focused on mastering concepts before practicing MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. However, he soon realized that MCQ practice was equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Daily Target**: He aimed to practice at least 50 MCQs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Recall-Based Practice**: Early on, he practiced MCQs from topics he had studied 4 days to a week prior to facilitate active recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules**: After completing one reading, he used customized modules to practice random questions from all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He found these 50-question sets useful as "mini-GTs," providing a good idea of performance daily without the length of a full Grand Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Bookmarks**: He extensively used the bookmark feature for questions but stressed the importance of updating bookmarks, removing those he had mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Magic Module**: He also liked the "magic module" feature in Marrow, though he discovered it later in his [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Grand Test (GT) Approach

Dr. Pushwand's GT schedule evolved during his [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | preparation]]:
*   **Frequency**: Initially, he took a GT once every two weeks, then increased it to once a week in the final few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Final Days**: He stopped giving GTs in the last 10 days before the exam, choosing to focus solely on revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He believed giving GTs too close to the exam could be counterproductive if scores were low, potentially affecting confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Reviewing Grand Tests

Reviewing GTs was crucial, and Dr. Pushwand developed a specific strategy:
*   **Guess and Wrong Answers**: He utilized Marrow's filter option to see incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He also marked questions he had guessed correctly but didn't know the concept, or those where he derived the answer from options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Focused Review**: His review focused primarily on these "guessed" and "wrong" questions, as they constituted the essential learning points from the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: He stopped reviewing the entire GT, as it was time-consuming and futile, taking an extra 3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The "guess tracker" feature was particularly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Revision Strategy

Dr. Pushwand had a plan for the last one to one-and-a-half months of [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | revision]], though it didn't go exactly 100% to plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Annotated Notes**: He used concise and crisp annotated notes provided by a friend, which he further added to with important MCQs and new points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. He primarily focused on important topics where he felt he was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Topics**: Based on the INI CET pattern and recalls, he observed that the exam often repeats concepts within the same topics, going in-depth or presenting different perspectives rather than being very diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. He emphasized revisiting important topics, adhering to the 80/20 principle (80% of questions from 20% of topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Time Management During the Exam

Dr. Pushwand had a structured approach to [[strategies_for_maximizing_performance_during_exam_time | time management]] during the actual exam, refined through GT practice:
*   **Consistent Pace**: In GTs, he aimed to complete each 50-question section with at least seven minutes remaining, maintaining a consistent pace that was neither too fast nor too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Simulated Exam Environment**: He made GTs as realistic as possible by avoiding distractions like phones or the internet, and enduring the three-hour sitting to get habituated to the exam environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Question Approach**:
    *   For unknown questions, he would not spend more than one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   For lengthy questions, he would read the last line first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. If he thought he knew the answer, he would then read the entire question and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Mark for Review**: Given the rule change where "mark for review" questions would not be counted if not finally submitted, he would answer the question and note it down on paper. This ensured the answer was submitted even if time ran out, allowing him to review it later if time permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Life Beyond Medicine

Outside of his intense [[ini_cet_exam_preparation_strategies | preparation for INI CET]], Dr. Pushwand found joy and passion in other activities:
*   **College Life**: He particularly cherishes his college experience in AIIMS, which was a reason he wanted to return for postgraduate studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Sports & Fitness**: Though not initially good at sports, he started playing badminton with friends, went swimming, and developed a strong passion for gymming in his third and fourth years, exploring gym science and nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Socializing**: Spending time with close friends, especially "chit-chatting in midnight in the coffee shop," was among his best memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

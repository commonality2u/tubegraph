Anatomy questions in exams, particularly the INICT, often emphasize [[Muscles and nerve innervation of the hand and forearm | muscle and nerve innervation in the limbs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. It is crucial to remember the innervation of both upper and lower limb muscles, especially from a compartment perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Knowing the overall muscles within each compartment and their nerve supply is vital for upcoming examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Upper Limb Innervation

### Ulnar Nerve
The ulnar nerve passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum as it enters the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In the forearm, the ulnar nerve supplies one and a half muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>:
*   **Flexor Carpi Ulnaris** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
*   **Medial half of Flexor Digitorum Profundus** (a hybrid muscle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>

Once in the hand, the ulnar nerve divides into a superficial and a deep branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Superficial Branch of Ulnar Nerve**
    *   Supplies only one muscle: Palmaris Brevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
        *   Palmaris Brevis is a subcutaneous hypothenar muscle, considered a remnant of the panniculus carnosus muscle seen in lower animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Deep Branch of Ulnar Nerve**
    *   Supplies remaining hypothenar muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
        *   Abductor Digiti Minimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
        *   Flexor Digiti Minimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
        *   Opponens Digiti Minimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
    *   Supplies all interossei (palmar and dorsal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. There are four palmar (uni-pennate) and four dorsal (bi-pennate) interossei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Supplies the third and fourth lumbricals (medial two, bi-pennate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. (First and second lumbricals, lateral two, uni-pennate, are supplied by the median nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Supplies Adductor Pollicis, which is sometimes referred to as the "graveyard of the ulnar nerve" because it is the last muscle supplied by the ulnar nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Can also supply the deep head of Flexor Pollicis Brevis (a hybrid muscle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Lower Limb Innervation

### Peroneal Nerve (Leg)
The sciatic nerve in the upper popliteal fossa divides into the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Tibial Nerve**: Supplies the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg (calf muscles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
    *   Superficial Calf Muscles: Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Plantaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   Deep Calf Muscles (Flexors): Flexor Hallucis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Longus, Tibialis Posterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Common Peroneal Nerve**: Winds around the neck of the fibula, which is a common site for nerve injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. It divides into superficial and deep peroneal nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
    *   **Superficial Peroneal Nerve**: Supplies the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
        *   Peroneus Longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>
        *   Peroneus Brevis (these are the two everters of the foot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>
    *   **Deep Peroneal Nerve**: Supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (extensors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
        *   Extensor Hallucis Longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>
        *   Extensor Digitorum Longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>
        *   Tibialis Anterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>
        *   Peroneus Tertius (a muscle of the anterior compartment, also called the "fifth tendon of extensor digitorum longus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Gluteus Maximus Muscle
The gluteus maximus muscle is a significant muscle of the lower limb, often emphasized in exams for its actions and attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Takes origin from multiple areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>:
    *   Posterior and lateral aspect of the gluteal surface of the hip bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
    *   Sacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>
    *   Coccyx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>
    *   Sacrotuberous ligament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>
    *   Thoracolumbar fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>
*   **Insertion**:
    *   Iliotibial band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>
    *   Gluteal tuberosity of the femur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Extension at the hip** (main action), it is known as the "stair climbing muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
    *   **External rotation** (especially the lower fibers due to their horizontal placement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
    *   **Abduction at the hip** (uppermost fibers are strong abductors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

It is important to differentiate Gluteus Maximus from Gluteus Medius and Minimus. While gluteus medius is the main muscle for abduction at the hip and responsible for Trendelenburg sign if not working, gluteus medius and minimus are also known for internal rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

[[Muscle and nerve anatomy | Muscle and nerve anatomy]] and [[Nerve injuries in neck anatomy | nerve injuries]] in limbs, as well as their functional actions, remain high-yield topics for examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.

From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

Dr. Sakshi Roahans, an OBGY faculty at Maru, discusses the Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) questions asked in the May [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | INICT exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## General Observations
In the May [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | INICET exam]], the number of OBGY questions was relatively few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. All questions were from expected topics, easy, and had straightforward options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These questions had been discussed in classes and video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Revising [[common_questions_and_themes_in_inicet_exams | INIC pyqs and INIC questions]] is beneficial not only for [[preparation_strategy_for_inicet | INIC]] but also for NEET PG, as the topics are important for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Question Analysis

### 1. Imaging Modality Contraindicated in Pregnancy
**Question**: Which imaging modality is contraindicated in pregnancy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
**Answer**: CT scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Avoided Imaging Modalities**: CT scan and X-ray are generally avoided in pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, they are not absolutely contraindicated and can be used in essential circumstances as the radiation exposure is less than the permissible limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Maximum Permissible Radiation Exposure**: The maximum permissible radiation exposure in pregnancy is five rads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Absolutely Contraindicated Investigations**: Gadolinium MRI, any investigation involving a contrast agent, and radioactive iodine are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Most Teratogenic Period**: The embryonic period (3 weeks to 8 weeks after fertilization) is the most teratogenic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **MRI Compatibility**:
    *   **MRI Compatible**: Nexplanon implant, copper IUCD, metallic sutures from C-section, and new pacemakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **MRI Non-Compatible**: Cochlear implant and old pacemakers/intracranial clips (though newer ones are compatible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. Rotterdam Criteria for PCOS Diagnosis
**Question**: According to Rotterdam criteria, which of the following are used for diagnosing PCOS? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
**Answer**: Delayed periods (ovulatory dysfunction) and hirsutism (increased androgen levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Rotterdam Criteria**: Any two of the following three criteria must be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>:
    1.  Increased androgen levels (hirsutism or biochemical test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    2.  Ovulatory dysfunction (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    3.  Polycystic appearance on ultrasound (≥12 follicles of 2-9mm in size or ovarian volume ≥10cc) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Not a Criteria for PCOS Diagnosis**: Obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, LH:FSH ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, menometrorrhagia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, and necklace pattern of follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis**: Late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a close differential diagnosis for PCOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The screening test to differentiate is 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Updated Ultrasound Criteria**: While Rotterdam criteria states ≥12 follicles, European and American societies now suggest ≥20 follicles for a polycystic ovary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Rotterdam criteria does not specify follicles must be arranged peripherally (necklace pattern is not diagnostic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Dr. Fatima, who achieved a remarkable score of 246 out of 300 in the recently concluded FMGE exam, shared her [[preparation_strategies_for_fmge | preparation strategies]] and advice for future aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Her insights, particularly as a Marrow Plan C user who completed her MBBS in Dubai, offer valuable guidance for [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | medical entrance exam preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Dr. Fatima's Journey and Key Strategies

Dr. Fatima began utilizing Marrow from her second year of MBBS, initially using it for supplementary lectures to gain added information, especially for challenging subjects like pharmacology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While she wasn't always consistent early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, she made small notes from lectures. She primarily used Marrow's main videos for core clinical subjects (medicine, ob-gyn, surgery, and pediatrics), and also for ENT and ophthalmology, which helped with clinical postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Her solid [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation]] for the FMGE exam commenced in September, after her internship concluded, dedicating six months to focused study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Comprehensive [[FMGE Exam Preparation Strategies | Preparation Strategies]]

### Early Engagement and Consistency
Starting preparation early, even during MBBS, can build a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While initial inconsistency is common, developing [[importance_of_consistent_study_habits_for_fmge | consistent study habits]] over time is crucial for long-term retention.

### Strategic Use of Resources
*   **Main Videos & Notes:** Utilize main video lectures for core subjects and create concise notes. For clinical subjects where main videos were already covered, focus on reading notes rather than re-watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Revision Modules:** If weak in preclinical subjects, use revision modules and their associated Q banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Marrow Plan C:** Dr. Fatima specifically highlights her use of Marrow Plan C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, suggesting its effectiveness as part of her overall [[dr_fatimas_study_strategy_for_fmge_using_marrow_plan_c | study strategy for FMGE]].

### Mastering MCQs
*   **Regular Practice:** Begin by solving 50 to 100 MCQs daily and gradually increase the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Active Recall:** Use MCQs as a primary revision tool to actively recall information, which is more effective than passive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Question Bank Selection:** Don't limit practice to only FMGE Q banks. Solving NEET PG and INI CET Q banks helps in better preparation, as these exams are conducted by the same board, and questions or topics may overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This "pushing yourself beyond" the target exam level can lead to higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** Bookmark incorrect questions. If an image or flowchart is relevant, save it and integrate it into your notes for future review of that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs) and Mock Exams
*   **Regular Mock Tests:** Take mock tests and Grand Tests (GTS) regularly. Dr. Fatima started giving GTs within 2-3 weeks of her concentrated six-month preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Analyze Performance:** Utilize the GT analysis provided by platforms like Marrow to identify weak subjects. Focus on studying these weak areas before attempting the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Practice Exam Strategy:** Treat GTs not as final exams but as opportunities to get accustomed to the exam format and practice ruling out options, which is crucial for an MCQ-based test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Dr. Fatima's score in mock tests ranged from 160-223, but she achieved 246 in the actual exam, demonstrating the value of consistent GT practice and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Content Focus
*   **Beyond PYQs:** Do not solely rely on previous year questions (PYQs). It is essential to read around the topics mentioned in PYQs and build a strong conceptual base of the entire subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Mixed Difficulty:** The actual exam might have a mixed bag of questions with varying difficulty levels, similar to how GTs are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Last Month Strategy
*   **Structured Revision:** Plan a dedicated schedule for the second revision of all subjects, aiming to complete everything within a specific timeframe (e.g., 20 days for 19 subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Targeted Practice:** In the final 10 days, avoid pushing too hard on new content. Instead, solve Q banks for subjects not entirely completed, focusing on PYQs from NEET PG and INI CET. Read explanations and integrate new information into existing notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Dr. Fatima's Top Five Tips for Future FMGE Takers
1.  **Don't Skip Any Subject:** Every subject is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Base Knowledge:** Don't just focus on PYQs; read the topics thoroughly and have a strong understanding of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
3.  **Solve All Q Banks:** Solve as many question banks as possible, including those beyond FMGE, such as NEET PG and INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
4.  **Regular GTs:** Give more Grand Tests to get used to the exam pattern, rather than taking them as the final exam itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
5.  **Manage Stress:** Don't get too stressed out, and ensure you have a good support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

These [[effective_fmge_preparation_strategies | strategies for preparing for FMGE and INICET exams]] emphasize the importance of active learning, consistent practice, and a holistic approach to subject mastery.

## Session 1 Recalled Questions

### Ear Questions

#### 1. Nerve Supply of the External Ear
**Question:** Which nerve supplies marked parts on the external ear? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The nerve supply of the ear is a frequently asked question, either directly or as referred otalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   The skin covering the pinna gets nerve supply from adjacent areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **A: Auriculotemporal nerve** supplies the tragus and the ascending crus of the helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It also supplies the anterior wall and roof of the external auditory canal, and the anterior and superior parts of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **B: Greater Auricular nerve** (branch of C2 C3) supplies the major part of the lateral and medial surfaces of the pinna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Cervical spondylosis (C2 and C3 involvement) can cause referred pain to the ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **C: Vagus nerve** supplies the concha of the pinna, the floor and posterior wall of the external auditory canal, and the lower and posterior part of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Referred pain to the ear from carcinoma of the larynx or piriform fossa is due to the vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Coughing while cleaning the ear (Arnold's reflex) is also due to the vagus nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Facial nerve** provides a small contribution to the poster-superior part of the external auditory meatus and the adjacent canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Lesser Occipital nerve** (C2) supplies the postero-superior part of the pinna on the medial surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Glossopharyngeal nerve** (Jacobson's nerve) refers pain from the oropharynx (e.g., tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, base of tongue carcinoma) to the ear via its tympanic branch, supplying the middle ear and medial surface of the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

#### 2. Vestibular Neuritis and Head Impulse Test
**Question:** Patient with left side vestibular neuritis had positive head impulse test. What does it indicate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Vestibular neuritis is an acute inflammation of the vestibular nerve, resulting in a hypoactive lesion of the labyrinth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Acute, sudden onset, continuous vertigo lasting 3-7 days, with absolutely normal hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Nystagmus:** Spontaneous, horizontal nystagmus directed towards the more active (normal) side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For left vestibular neuritis, nystagmus is towards the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The direction of nystagmus is defined by its fast component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Head Impulse Test (HIT):** A vestibular function test that assesses the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   **Normal VOR:** Head movement to the right causes immediate, equally fast eye movement to the left, keeping vision fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   **Positive HIT (Abnormal):** If the vestibular system is not functioning (e.g., left vestibular neuritis), turning the head rapidly to the affected side (left) causes the eyes to move slowly in the opposite direction, lagging behind. Before reaching the target, the eyes make quick, corrective movements called "catch-up saccades" (saccades to the right for left vestibular neuritis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   HIT is a quick, easy OPD procedure that can test each labyrinth and semicircular canal separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.# ENT Exam Recall and Question Distribution (NEET 2024)

#### 3. Cochlear Implant Parts
**Question:** Identify the part of the cochlear implant marked. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   A cochlear implant has external and internal devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **External Device:** Microphone, speech processor, transmitter coil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Internal Device:** Receiver stimulator (converts digital signal to electrical impulses) and electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   Intra-cochlear electrodes are placed in the scala tympani via the round window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
    *   An extra-cochlear electrode, known as the **ground electrode** or reference electrode, stays outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. It is mainly for power regulation and to regulate stimulation intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   Magnets hold the receiver stimulator and transmitter coil in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Nose Questions

#### 1. Sensation Loss with Superior Orbital Fissure Compression
**Question:** Sensation will be lost in which area if the superior orbital fissure is compressed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Structures passing through the superior orbital fissure: Oculomotor (III), Trochlear (IV), Abducens (VI) nerves (motor), and the Ophthalmic branch of the Trigeminal nerve (V1) (sensory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   The Ophthalmic nerve enters the orbit as three branches: Lacrimal, Frontal, and Nasociliary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
    *   **Lacrimal nerve:** Supplies the lacrimal gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
    *   **Frontal nerve:** Gives Supraorbital and Supratrochlear branches, supplying sensation to the forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
    *   **Nasociliary nerve:** Gives ciliary branches and nasal branches (posterior and anterior ethmoidal nerves). The anterior ethmoidal nerve gives an external nasal branch that supplies the lower part of the dorsum of the external nose up to the tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   Loss of sensation would be to the skin over the forehead and the tip of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Distinguish from:**
    *   Maxillary nerve (V2) via infraorbital foramen supplies the skin over the maxillary sinus and infraorbital area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
    *   Maxillary nerve via sphenopalatine foramen supplies the lateral wall of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

#### 2. Identify Blocked Sinus on CT Scan
**Question:** A 45-year-old male presents with nasal obstruction and undergoes a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses. Identify the blocked sinus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The image shows a coronal CT cut. Orbits are visible in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   Maxillary sinuses are visible as large structures, and discharge is evident within one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   Frontal sinuses appear in the most anterior cuts, where maxillary sinuses appear small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   Sphenoid sinuses appear in more posterior cuts where orbits are no longer visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   Based on the image description, the maxillary sinus is blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

#### 3. Identify Condition from Imaging
**Question:** Identify the condition based on this image. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The image shows:
    *   X-ray with dextrocardia (heart on the opposite side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
    *   CT chest showing bronchiectasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
    *   NCCT nose and paranasal sinuses showing chronic sinusitis in maxillary and ethmoid sinuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   The combination of bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, and situs inversus (dextrocardia) is characteristic of **Kartagener's Syndrome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   Other differential diagnoses:
    *   Cystic Fibrosis: Can have bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis (and polyps) but not dextrocardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
    *   Young Syndrome: Bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis but not dextrocardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
    *   Atrophic Rhinitis: Not associated with bronchiectasis or dextrocardia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

#### 4. Investigation of Choice for Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)
**Question:** A 14-year-old boy presented with nasal obstruction and recurrent episodes of bleeding from the nose. Endoscopic picture is shown below. What is investigation of choice? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Clinical presentation (pubertal male, nasal obstruction, recurrent epistaxis) strongly suggests Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   The endoscopic picture showing a red vascular mass further confirms JNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   The definitive diagnosis and investigation of choice for JNA is a **Contrast-Enhanced CT (CCT) scan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **CT Findings:** The enhancing mass is typically seen in the sphenopalatine fossa, nose, nasopharynx, and sometimes laterally into the infratemporal fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. A key sign is the anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary antrum (Holman-Miller sign or Antral sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

### Larynx Questions

#### 1. Muscle Involved in High Pitch Singing Difficulty
**Question:** A female singer presents with a complaint of not being able to sing in high pitch. On examination, one vocal cord was bowed and at a lower level than the other. Which muscle is involved? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   High pitch singing requires tension in the vocal cords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   The muscle responsible for raising the pitch and tensing the vocal cords is the **Cricothyroid muscle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   The cricothyroid is the only laryngeal muscle supplied by the **external laryngeal nerve** (a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which comes from the vagus nerve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   Injury to the external laryngeal nerve or weakness of the cricothyroid muscle leads to difficulty in raising vocal pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

#### 2. Sign in Esophageal Foreign Body X-ray
**Question:** In given X-ray, which of the following sign is seen? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The X-ray shows a round foreign body in the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
    *   In the larynx, a foreign body appears on AP view with its rim (longest diameter is AP).
    *   In the esophagus, a foreign body appears round on AP view (longest diameter is horizontal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   The image shows a round, non-homogeneous foreign body with two ring-like appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   This is typical of a **button battery**, which has a beveled appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   The specific sign seen on AP view for a button battery is the **double ring sign** or Halo appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. On lateral view, a beveled appearance and "step-off" at the edge are seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

#### 3. Difficulty Due to Tracheal Deviation
**Question:** Which of the following will be difficult in the given patient (X-ray showing gross tracheal deviation)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The X-ray clearly shows gross tracheal deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.
*   **Tracheostomy** involves accessing the trachea to create an opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Gross deviation of the trachea would make this procedure significantly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   Other options are not directly affected:
    *   Nasogastric tube is passed into the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
    *   Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
    *   Indirect laryngoscopy is performed by passing a scope into the oropharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

## Session 2 Recalled Questions

### Ear Questions

#### 1. Rinne Test Finding in Tympanic Membrane Perforation
**Question:** A patient presented with a complaint of hearing loss. The otoscopic finding is shown below (perforation of tympanic membrane). What will be the Rinne test finding? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Perforation of the tympanic membrane causes **conductive hearing loss** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   In conductive hearing loss, the Rinne test is **negative** (Bone Conduction > Air Conduction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

#### 2. Diagnosis from Pulsatile Tinnitus, Red Mass, and CT Scan
**Question:** A patient presents with pulsatile tinnitus. A red mass was seen behind the tympanic membrane. CT is given below. What is the diagnosis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Pulsatile tinnitus with a red mass behind the tympanic membrane strongly suggests a vascular tumor, specifically a **glomus tumor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   To differentiate between Glomus Tympanicum (arises from tympanic plexus on promontory) and Glomus Jugulare (arises from jugular bulb in floor of middle ear), CT scan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   The provided CT scan shows a mass in the jugular bulb area at the floor of the middle ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   This indicates **Glomus Jugulare** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

#### 3. Sign in Otosclerosis
**Question:** A 40-year-old female presents with progressive bilateral conductive hearing loss. The Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA) is shown below (showing AB Gap and a dip at 2000 Hz). Which sign will be seen in this condition? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The history (middle-aged female, bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss) and PTA findings (AB gap and Carhart's notch, a dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz) are classic for **Otosclerosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Schwartze Sign:** A flamingo pink tympanic membrane seen in active otosclerosis due to increased vascularity of the active focus on the promontory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Hennebert's Sign:** Positive fistula test in a patient without an obvious fistula, often seen in conditions like superior semicircular canal dehiscence or hypermobile stapes footplate (e.g., congenital stapes fixation, Meniere's disease in some cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Hitzelberger's Sign:** Hypesthesia of the external auditory canal area supplied by the facial nerve, seen in acoustic neuroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   **Branley's Sign:** A hissing sound heard on compression of a swelling (often a plunging ranula) due to sudden gush of air into the lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

### Nose Questions

#### 1. Nasal Surgery Leading to Septal Perforation
**Question:** A patient underwent surgery for nasal obstruction, now presents with crusting. Endoscopic picture shows a perforation of the nasal septum. Which surgery was done? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Nasal septal perforation is a known complication of septal surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **Submucous Resection (SMR) operation** (Killian's operation of the septum) is a septal surgery where most of the septal cartilage is removed, leaving only mucosal linings. This significantly increases the chances of complications like perforation and saddling of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   **Inferior Meatal Antrostomy:** Creates an opening in the inferior meatus (lateral wall of the nose) for drainage or pack removal after Caldwell-Luc surgery, not involving the septum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS):** Addresses sinuses via the lateral wall of the nose, not the septum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.
*   **Denker's Operation:** A type of maxillectomy for maxillary carcinomas, involving removal of the lateral wall of the nose and anterior wall of the maxillary sinus, not dealing with the septum directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

#### 2. Nasal Surgery based on External Incision Mark
**Question:** A nasal surgery was done in this patient and the incision mark is shown (on the columella). Which of these was probably done? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The incision mark shown is on the columella of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Open Rhinoplasty** is a cosmetic surgery to correct external nasal deformities. It often involves an external incision, typically on the columella, to allow for better visualization and reshaping of the nasal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. Closed rhinoplasty involves incisions inside the nose to avoid external scars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
*   **Caldwell-Luc:** Uses a sublabial incision, not an external nasal incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **Mid-facial degloving:** Also uses a sublabial incision to avoid external facial scars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.
*   **Denker's operation:** As discussed above, involves extensive maxillectomy, not typically indicated by just a columellar incision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

#### 3. False Statement About Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD)
**Question:** A patient presents with difficulty in breathing after taking aspirin. Previously one episode of breathing difficulty had happened on administration of aspirin. Which is false about this condition? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The clinical picture (breathing difficulty/asthma, nasal polyps) on aspirin intake describes **Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD)**, also known as Samter's Triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** It is a **non-allergic hypersensitivity** (not IgE-mediated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Aspirin (a COX-1 inhibitor) blocks the cyclooxygenase pathway, diverting arachidonic acid metabolism to the lipoxygenase pathway. This leads to increased leukotriene formation (causing bronchoconstriction, increased mucus, nasal polyps) and decreased prostaglandins (leading to mast cell destabilization, histamine release, vascular permeability, nasal obstruction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   Patients are also hypersensitive to other COX-1 inhibitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   **Treatment:** Montelukast (a leukotriene inhibitor) can reduce symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.
*   The false statement is that it is an allergic (IgE-mediated) response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

### Laryngopharynx Questions

#### 1. Gag Reflex Nerve Injury
**Question:** Gag reflex will be absent in which nerve injury? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The gag reflex is a protective reflex to prevent foreign bodies from entering the airways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   It is triggered by touching the base of the tongue, tonsil area, or posterior pharyngeal wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Afferent (sensory) limb:** Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. It senses the stimulus and sends impulses to the nucleus of tractus solitarius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **Efferent (motor) limb:** Vagus nerve (X) via the pharyngeal plexus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. It causes contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (primarily superior constrictor) and elevation of the palate, leading to expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   Absence of gag reflex indicates injury to cranial nerves IX and X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

### Larynx Questions

#### 1. Staging for Subglottic Stenosis
**Question:** A patient with a history of prolonged intubation presents with breathlessness following a seen on laryngoscope. Be staging for this as given by? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   Prolonged intubation is a common cause of **subglottic stenosis**, which appears as narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords on laryngoscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   The staging for subglottic stenosis is given by the **Cotton-Myer classification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.
*   This classification divides stenosis into four grades based on the percentage of airway obstruction:
    *   Grade I: Up to 50% obstruction (often asymptomatic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>
    *   Grade II: 51-70% obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>
    *   Grade III: 71-99% obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>
    *   Grade IV: No detectable lumen (complete obstruction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>
*   Other options (AJCC, TNM) are cancer staging systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

#### 2. Intraoperative Stain for Laryngeal Growth
**Question:** Intraoperatively, which stain is used to view the following region (image of vocal cords with a dirty growth)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The image shows a growth on the vocal cord, likely a carcinoma of the larynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   For intraoperative visualization of malignant areas, **supravital stains** are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Toluidine blue** is a common supravital stain used. Carcinomatous areas pick up the stain, while leukoplakia areas do not, helping to identify biopsy sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Methylene blue** is also used intraoperatively during Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) to delineate tumor margins, often in conjunction with contact endoscopy (high magnification endoscopy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   Congored is for amyloidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>. H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) is used for histopathological examination post-biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Silver nitrate is for proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

#### 3. Sniffing Position
**Question:** The given position is? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The position shown involves flexion at the cervico-thoracic joint (neck) and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint (head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.
*   This is known as the **Sniffing Position** (or "sniffing the morning air") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. It is also called the Barking Dog position or Chevalier Jackson position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** It aligns the axis of the oral cavity with the larynx and pharynx, making direct laryngoscopy and microlaryngeal surgeries (MLS) easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. It is also the ideal position for intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Distinguish from Rose's Position:** Rose's position involves extension at both the neck and atlanto-occipital joints, achieved by placing a bag below the shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. It is used for tracheostomy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy to keep the larynx at a higher level and the head at a lower level to reduce aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

### Esophagus Questions

#### 1. True Statement Regarding Esophageal Foreign Body
**Question:** Which of the following treatment is true regarding the esophageal foreign body (image shows a coin)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>
**Explanation:**
*   The image shows a coin, which is the most common esophageal foreign body in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. In adults, it is usually a meat bolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
*   **Complications of impaction:** Impaction can lead to abrasion, stenosis, stricture formation, and rarely, perforation leading to mediastinitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Perforation is more common following esophagoscopy and removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
*   **Common sites of impaction:** The esophagus has three physiological constrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>:
    1.  **Cricopharyngeal sphincter:** Around 15 cm from incisors, the narrowest part and most common site of foreign body lodgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.
    2.  Arch of aorta and left main bronchus: Around 25 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.
    3.  Diaphragmatic hiatus: Around 40 cm (lower esophageal sphincter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   The most common site of impaction is at or just below the cricopharyngeal sphincter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

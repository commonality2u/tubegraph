Dr. Tes Dagan, who achieved rank eight in the INICET November 2024 exam, shared his preparation journey and valuable insights, highlighting the significant [[Role of video lectures in medical education | role of video lectures]] and [[Importance of using a QBank for exam preparation | question banks]] in his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Dr. Dagan completed his undergraduate studies at KEM Mumbai and is currently a radiology resident at PGIMER Chandigarh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Beginning the PG Preparation Journey

Dr. Dagan was a studious student from his first year, initially studying from standard textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He began [[Utilizing digital tools and Q banks for exam preparation | using Marrow]] from his third year for third and fourth-year subjects, later incorporating first and second-year Marrow content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A strong foundation in undergraduate first and second-year subjects is vital, as they cover a majority of third and fourth-year subjects, reducing the need for extra effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Integrating [[Role of video resources in understanding complex medical subjects | Videos]] into Study

Dr. Dagan primarily used Marrow's main videos for third and fourth-year subjects, which he studied "from scratch" without relying on textbooks for these specific years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For first and second-year subjects, where his foundational knowledge was already strong, he only watched videos for specific topics he was unsure about or consistently answered incorrectly in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Marrow videos made a significant difference in his preparation, particularly for ENT and Surgery, which he found to be the best and very good, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## The Central Role of [[Utilizing Question Banks for Competitive Medical Exams | Q Banks]]

Dr. Dagan emphasized that the Q Bank was his main source of preparation, more so than the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. His approach involved systematically going through the Q Bank from the first question to the last, making notes or taking photos, and organizing them into folders for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

> "I means my friend had taught me how to use the Q bang so what I would do was just go from the starting module first question to the last module last question I used to make notes or take photos and make folders and I would just revise them so basically I was covering means the Q bank has entire standard textbook in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>

He found that the Q Bank effectively covered content from standard textbooks in a question format, complete with tables and "pearls" in the explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. He used this method for approximately 10-12 subjects and repeatedly revised the created folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Solving Q Banks also helped him develop a strategy for approaching multiple-choice questions (MCQs), such as ruling out options and understanding that the answer is usually something one already knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This extensive practice, with Marrow's large volume of questions (15-20K), helps in-build these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Marrow Test Series]]

Dr. Dagan began taking Grand Tests (GTs) at the start of his final year and subject tests as they became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. He avoided mini-tests because they caused anxiety and resulted in "horrible ranks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

His main focus was on subject tests and GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. For subject tests, he only reviewed incorrect answers, but he religiously reviewed every Grand Test, dedicating a full day to each GT review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

He used GTs to benchmark his performance against other students, which added confidence when consistently achieving good ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Importantly, GTs helped him identify his weaker subjects, allowing him to prioritize those areas during revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He advises starting GTs early (in final year) to identify weak subjects before internship begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Notes and [[Study and revision techniques for medical exams | Revision Techniques]]

Dr. Dagan did not rely on handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He primarily used Marrow's in-video notes and some printed notes during his third and fourth years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. During his internship, his "notes" transitioned to the folders he created from the Q Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He would open the app and read directly from the Q Bank folders, adding new information from Q Banks, GTs, and older GTs into these folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

For revision, he primarily re-read his Q Bank folders multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He believes that one thorough revision combined with numerous practice tests is sufficient in the final month before an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Custom Modules and Marathon

While not an "avid user" of custom modules, Dr. Dagan and his friends would create mixed-bag custom modules of 50 or 100 questions for practice and to "do something different" than reading notes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The main purpose of these modules was consistent MCQ solving practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

He also found the Marrow Marathon feature to be a "great concept" that motivates daily problem-solving and helps users stay on track with their preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Final Advice

Dr. Dagan advises aspirants to:
*   Decide on their target branch and desired score early in their preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   Use GT ranks to gauge performance against this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   Be consistent throughout the preparation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   Prepare well in advance rather than cramming at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

Consistency and utilizing the right resources in the right way are key to achieving one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

Dr. Bhavik Chrani, who achieved an impressive Rank 10 in the INI CET May 2025 exam, shares his insights on how the strategic use of [[importance_of_solving_question_banks_and_grand_tests | question banks]] and Grand Tests (GTs) was crucial to his success. Bhavik emphasizes that while initially his pace was not good and he wasn't solving many questions or giving GTs, he realized towards the end of his third professional year that he "had to give GTs" and "solve question banks," which "really helped a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>.

## Early Start and Integration with Studies

It is highly recommended to start preparation as early as possible, ideally even in the first professional year, to gain an edge over others and become familiar with studying patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:08">[03:30:08]</a>. When watching main videos, students should simultaneously solve questions from the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | question bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:41">[04:40:41]</a>. After completing a subject's main videos, it is beneficial to give regular subject-wise tests at monthly or fortnightly intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:03">[04:52:03]</a>. This approach helps in understanding how concepts from lectures are framed into questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:33">[05:07:33]</a>.

## Strategic Use of Question Banks

Dr. Bhavik started seriously tackling the [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | question bank]] in his third professional year, achieving 65-75% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>.

### Resetting and Systemic Approach
Initially, Bhavik's approach to the [[using_question_banks_and_practice_modules | question bank]] was patchy and unorganized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. In his fourth professional year, he reset the [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | question bank]] and redid all questions in a systematic, subject-wise manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Importance of Questions for Revision
Despite making notes from main, revision, and MCQ discussion videos, Bhavik never read them for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. His revision was "only through questions, questions, and questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. He utilized subject tests, previous year's papers, mini-tests, and GTs extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. He solved all available previous year GTs, even those from 2017 and 2018, noting that while patterns change, the underlying topics remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.

## Mastering Grand Tests (GTs)

### When to Start and Frequency
Bhavik started giving GTs towards the end of his third professional year and became consistent from the fourth professional year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Initially, he gave one GT per month, then twice a month, eventually settling into a routine of giving one GT or solving at least two subject tests every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. This means he was revising all 19 subjects every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

### The Crucial Step of Reviewing GTs
Reviewing GTs is "the most hectic part but that is also the most important part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Bhavik reviewed all incorrect questions, then skipped ones, and finally glanced through all correct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

### Approach to Questions and Tricky Questions
Initially, Bhavik left many questions in GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Towards the end, he became more aggressive in his approach, marking more questions, as he realized his thinking was often in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. In the INI CET exam, he marked 195 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

For tricky questions, Bhavik advises marking them for review, moving on, and coming back to them later with a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. His main strength was his ability to eliminate options, often by just looking at the last line of the question, which helped him gain speed and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

### [[utilizing_gt_analytics_for_exam_preparation | Utilizing GT Analytics]]
Bhavik used [[utilizing_gt_analytics_for_exam_preparation | GT Analytics]] initially to identify weaker subjects and areas that needed more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. For example, knowing he got most Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ob-Gy) questions incorrect prompted him to pay more attention to that subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

## Consistency and Overcoming FOMO

Consistency is "the only thing that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Studying for a few days and then stopping for a month is a waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Being consistent is the most difficult and frustrating part of the journey, but it must be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. Success in these exams is an "open secret": all resources are available, and the only requirement is to be consistent every single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

Regarding new editions or content, Bhavik experienced FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) but prioritized [[effective utilization of Qbank and GT Grand Tests | question banks]], GTs, and subject tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. Once main videos are completed, the focus should shift to revision videos, MCQ discussion videos, GTs, and subject/mini-tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

For those encountering many new questions in custom modules just before exams and feeling demotivated, Bhavik advises continuing with the custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>. The knowledge gained from these new questions prepares students for difficult scenarios in the actual exam, making the real exam feel like just "another question test or GT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. Making mistakes in the [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question bank]] is encouraged, as it's part of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a significant public health concern, with various pathogens causing a range of clinical presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Diagnosis often relies on clinical signs, patient history, and laboratory confirmation, while treatment varies depending on the causative agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Specific Sexually Transmitted Infections

### Syphilis
Syphilis is caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Secondary Syphilis**
    *   Often presents with an asymptomatic rash, typically consisting of macules over the chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Moist, gray perianal lesions, known as [[sexually_transmitted_infections_and_urethritis | condyloma lata]], are a characteristic finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. These lesions are moist due to friction in genital and perianal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Scalp findings can include patchy non-scarring alopecia, specifically referred to as "moth-eaten alopecia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Primary Syphilis**
    *   The ulcer is described as a "hard sore" or "hard chancre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   Treatment for primary syphilis is typically Benzathine penicillin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Genital Herpes
Genital herpes is caused by a virus and typically presents with painful vesicular lesions over the genital area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   The primary lesion in genital herpes is a vesicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   A history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom usage is often associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Treatment often includes Acyclovir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   In pregnant women at term with active genital herpes infection and a history of previous Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCs), a Cesarean section is indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

### Gonorrhea
Gonorrhea is caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, a gram-negative intracellular diplococcus, often described as kidney bean-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Presentation**
    *   Common symptoms in adult males include dysuria (painful micturition) and purulent urethral discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   Microscopy often shows gram-negative intracellular cocci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. While frequently intracellular, they can also be found extracellularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
    *   The best culture medium for isolating *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* is the modified Thayer-Martin medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
        *   This is a selective culture medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
        *   Its base medium is chocolate agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
        *   It contains antibiotics to inhibit other organisms: Vancomycin (inhibits Gram-positive organisms), Colistin (inhibits other Gram-negative organisms), Nystatin (inhibits fungi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The *modified* Thayer-Martin medium also includes Trimethoprim to inhibit *Proteus* species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.
*   **Treatment**
    *   The best treatment for gonorrhea is generally a cephalosporin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
    *   Cefixime 400 mg stat is an appropriate treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
    *   In medical colleges, Injection Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM stat is commonly given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
    *   These treatments are part of the syndromic management, typically associated with Kit number 1 (gray in color) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### Other Related Conditions
*   **Chancroid**
    *   The ulcer in chancroid is known as a "soft sore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Can present with multiple tender ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   May involve the presence of a bubo in the inguinal region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

    *   Can present with thickening of the palms and soles, referred to as keratoderma blennorrhagicum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   It can be acquired via [[bacterial_infections_and_eological_agents | sexually]] or gastrointestinal (GI) infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Bacterial Vaginosis**

Dr. Leela Jain Khandelwal provides an in-depth analysis of [[pathology_questions_in_inict_november_2024_exam | pathology questions]] asked in the May [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | INICET exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The overall impression of the exam was moderate to severe difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, described as a conceptual paper rather than straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Success required thorough revision of concepts and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, especially given the prevalence of "match the following" and multiple-option questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## General Exam Observations
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to severe, conceptual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Question Types:** Many "match the following" and multiple-option questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Revision Importance:** Two or three revisions are necessary to solve the [[detailed_pathology_topics_for_inict_and_neet | NEET PG]] or [[inicet_exam_pattern_and_preparation | INICET paper]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Pathology Specifics
*   **Number of Questions:** 15 to 20 questions with overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Question Nature:** Most questions were straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Topic Distribution:** Primarily from General Pathology and Systemic Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>; very few Hematology and Leukemias questions were asked this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Repetition:** Many topics were repeated, but questions were not directly repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Pathology Question Analysis

### Q1: Inflammation and Caspase-1 Dependent Cell Death
*   **Question:** Which of the following inflammation associated with caspase-1 dependent is seen in which type of cell death? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   **Options:** Necroptosis, Pyroptosis, Apoptosis, Ferroptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Necroptosis:** A combination of necrosis and apoptosis, but it is **caspase-independent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Proteins involved are RIP1 and RIP3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   **Pyroptosis:** Associated with inflammation (IL-1 involvement) and the involvement of **caspase-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   **Apoptosis:** Involves initiator caspases (8 and 9) and executor caspases (3 and 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Caspase-1 is not involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Ferroptosis:** Due to increased iron levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, and no caspases are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Answer:** Pyroptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This was considered an easy question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Q2: HPV Strains and Cervical Cancer
*   **Question:** Which of the following strains of HPV are more commonly responsible for cervical cancer? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   **Options:** 6, 11; 16, 18; 31, 33; 42, 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Low-risk HPV strains:** 6 and 11, cause condyloma acuminata (genital lesions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   **High-risk HPV strains:** 16 and 18, responsible for cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Answer:** 16 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This was the simplest question asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Important Related Concept: HPV Pathogenesis**
    *   HPV produces E6 and E7 proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   E6 binds to P53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   E7 binds to RB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   P53 and RB are tumor suppressor genes; their deactivation leads to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Q12: Best Test for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Genetic Testing
*   **Question:** A 30-year-old female with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer requires genetic testing. She can only afford one test. Which test should be done? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>
*   **Options:** BRCA1, P10, TP53, CDH1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>
*   **Context:** Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) of breast was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **BRCA1:** Most commonly associated gene with familial breast and ovarian cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. It carries the highest risk (55%) of developing breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a> and is often linked to triple-negative breast cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.
    *   **P10:** Associated with Cowden syndrome; can be linked to thyroid, endometrial, and breast cancers, but less strongly than BRCA1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.
    *   **TP53:** Associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, increasing the risk of multiple cancers including breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>, but BRCA1 is the most common association for familial breast/ovarian cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.
    *   **CDH1:** Associated with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast, leading to loss of E-cadherin and an Indian file pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Best Test:** Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the best test for BRCA1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. If NGS is not an option, then qPCR for quantification of BRCA1/2 expression levels can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Answer:** BRCA1 (implying testing for BRCA1 mutation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

### Q14: False Statements Regarding Free Radicals
*   **Question:** Identify the false statements regarding free radicals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>
*   **Statements:** Lipid peroxidation of membranes, Produced by neutrophils and involved in respiratory burst, Superoxide dismutase inactivates the free radicals, It causes fibrinoid necrosis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Lipid peroxidation of membranes:** True. Free radical injury causes lipid peroxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. (e.g., lipofuscin is a pigment produced by this) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
    *   **Produced by neutrophils and involved in respiratory burst:** True. In respiratory burst, oxygen is converted to superoxide radical by NADPH oxidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.
    *   **Superoxide dismutase inactivates the free radicals:** True. SOD is an enzyme that inactivates free radicals (along with catalase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
    *   **It causes fibrinoid necrosis:** False. Free radicals are not related to fibrinoid necrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Answer:** The original question was likely "identify the *true* statements" and the answer was A, B, C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

The analysis highlights that questions required a strong conceptual understanding and inter-subject correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Consistent revision is emphasized as crucial for success in exams like [[inicet_exam_preparation_strategies | INICET]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.

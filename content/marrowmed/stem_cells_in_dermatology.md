Stem cells are cells capable of self-renewal and can differentiate into specific cell types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Locations of Stem Cells in the Skin
There are three important locations for stem cells in the skin:
1.  **Interfollicular Epidermis**: Found in the stratum basale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Base of the Sebaceous Gland** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Bulge of the Hair Follicle**: This area represents the attachment of the arrector pili muscle to the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Functions of Stem Cells
Stem cells in the skin have three important functions:
1.  **Maintains Skin Homeostasis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Regeneration of Skin Appendages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Self-Repair**: Enabled by their capability for self-renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Embryology of Skin Layers
Understanding the [[general_embryology | embryological]] origin of skin layers is important:
*   The epidermis is derived from the ectoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   The hypodermis and dermis are derived from the mesoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
    *   *Note*: The statement that hypodermis and dermis are derived from the endoderm is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   The dermis of the face and frontal scalp are derived from the [[neural_crest_derivatives | neural crest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   The dermis elsewhere on the body is derived from the mesoderm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

The epidermis regenerates from deeper cells, including those found in hair follicles and sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This regenerative capacity is attributed to the stem cells located in these structures.

Dr. Utpal Bhanel of Marrow, an Ophthalmology Faculty, provided a recall discussion for the NEET PG 2024 Ophthalmology questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A total of 14 questions were asked across both sessions of the exam: six in the first session and eight in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This proportion is close to the norm of 3-4% of total questions being from Ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Purpose of Recall Videos

Recall videos are crucial not for expecting the exact same previous year questions ([[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | PYQs]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, but to understand the current topics being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Topics tend to remain relevant for two to three years before changes occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The goal is to comprehend the question formation, identify effective study approaches, and pinpoint high-yield topics for future preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Ophthalmology Question Distribution (NEET PG 2024)

### Session 1 Distribution
Six questions were asked in Session 1, all of which were image-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, four out of six questions could have been answered even without the image, as the image often served as an accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The distribution was even, with questions from various important topics:
*   Cornea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Eyelids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Retina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Neuro-Ophthalmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   Squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

### Session 2 Distribution
Eight questions were asked in Session 2, all of which were also considered easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. The distribution was equitable, covering most Ophthalmology topics:
*   Cornea and Sclera (two questions, one image-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>
*   Lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>
*   Glaucoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>
*   Conjunctiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>
*   Uvea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>

A notable exception was the absence of questions from Optics in both sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

*   **Cause**: Occurs due to a lesion below the optic chiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, affecting structures like the optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radiations, and visual cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Laterality**: Right-sided homonymous hemianopia implies a left-sided lesion (contralateral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

#### Episcleritis with Rheumatoid Arthritis
*   **Case**: A 26-year-old lady presented with a red nodule over her sclera that resolved with medications but was recurrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.
*   **Image Finding**: Red nodule on the sclera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**: Episcleritis, associated with rheumatoid arthritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Resolves with medications (e.g., phenylephrine eye drops cause blanching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
    *   Can be idiopathic, but can also be associated with collagen vascular disorders like rheumatoid arthritis in 25-30% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
    *   Nodular episcleritis presents as a nodule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Differential Diagnosis**:
    *   **Scleritis**: Does not resolve with medications and shows no blanching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. More commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.
    *   **Pterygium**: Triangular growth over the cornea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
    *   **Pinguecula**: Yellowish deposit, not a reddish nodule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

#### Bitemporal Hemianopia
*   **Context**: MRI image showed a malignancy; identify the visual field effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   **Image Finding**: Tumor greater than 1 cm in size, likely a pituitary adenoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis**: Bitemporal Hemianopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.
*   **Causes (3 PC and AC)**:
    *   **P**ituitary adenoma (macro adenoma, >1 cm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>
    *   **C**raniopharyngioma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>
    *   **C**avernous sinus thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>
    *   **T**hird ventricular glioma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>
    *   **A**nterior cerebral or anterior communicating artery aneurysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>
*   **Differential Diagnosis**:
    *   **Homonymous Hemianopia**: Lesion below optic chiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
    *   **Complete Blindness**: Bilateral cortical blindness, usually due to severe trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

#### Congenital Infantile Cataract
*   **Case**: A 2-month-old girl presented with leukocoria in the left eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Image Finding**: White pupillary reflex (leukocoria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Possible Diagnoses**: Leukocoria in an infant can indicate Retinoblastoma or Congenital Infantile Cataract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.
*   **Management (assuming Infantile Cataract)**:
    *   Immediate surgery is required, especially for unilateral cataract, to prevent sensory deprivation amblyopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
    *   For developmental cataracts (onset after 1 year), surgery can be delayed until 2-5 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
    *   Cataract surgery is typically done via Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE), with IOL implantation usually after 2 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>.
*   **General Management**: Medical therapy is not typically tried for cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

Overall, about 10 out of 14 Ophthalmology questions were considered easy, two required application of mind, and only two were mildly confusing, indicating an 85-90% hit ratio for well-prepared students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. It's important to study Ophthalmology thoroughly, focusing on topics rather than just specific questions from [[neet_pg_obg_questions_recall | previous years]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

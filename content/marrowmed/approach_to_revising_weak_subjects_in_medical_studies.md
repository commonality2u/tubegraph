Dr. Fatima, who scored 246 out of 300 in the FMG exam, shared her approach to tackling subjects she found difficult during her medical studies and exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Her methods emphasized consistent engagement with material and strategic use of practice questions.

## Initial Engagement with Difficult Subjects

From her second year of MBBS, Dr. Fatima used Marrow's supplementary lectures for subjects she found challenging, such as pharmacology and microbiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While listening to these lectures, she prepared small notes to consolidate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Addressing Weak Areas During Preparation

When beginning her solid preparation for the FMG exam, Dr. Fatima identified preclinical subjects as a weak area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. To address this, she focused on listening to the revision modules for these subjects and extensively solving question banks related to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. For clinical subjects, where she had already covered the main videos and was comfortable with her notes, she primarily relied on reading notes and solving question banks, rather than re-watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Specific Strategies for Pharmacology (Her Weakest Subject)

Pharmacology was identified by Dr. Fatima as her weakest subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. Her [[strategies_for_tackling_weak_areas_in_medical_subjects | extra efforts]] for this subject involved:
*   Primarily solving question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   Annotating more information into her notes from the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   She consciously decided not to over-exert herself on pharmacology, instead aiming to balance out her score by excelling in other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Utilizing Mock Tests and MCQs for Improvement

Dr. Fatima emphasized the crucial role of Grand Tests (GTS) and MCQs in improving scores and identifying weak areas:
*   **Identifying Weaknesses** Solving MCQs helps pinpoint areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **GT Analysis** After completing a GT, the analysis provided an idea of which subjects were weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. She would then prioritize studying those subjects before taking the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Active Recall** [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | Revision]] is more effective through questions, as it encourages active recall rather than passive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mistakes** For questions answered incorrectly, she would bookmark them. If there was an image or flowchart, she would save it and add it to her notes. This ensured that the next time she revised those notes, she would revisit the related topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Her favorite feature of the Marrow app for this was the custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## General [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | Study and Revision Techniques]]

*   **Don't Skip Subjects** She advises not to skip any subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Beyond PYQs** It's beneficial to read the topics surrounding Previous Year Questions (PYQs) and build a solid base for each subject, rather than just memorizing PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is because direct repeats have decreased in recent FMG exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Extensive Question Practice** Solve as many question banks as possible, including those from NEET PG and AIIMS, not just FMG-specific ones. This prepares students better for the exam, which has a similar board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Regular GTs** Giving more Grand Tests helps students get accustomed to the exam format and reduces pressure during the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] serves as a crucial anatomical region from which numerous [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerves]] emerge. Understanding their precise points of exit is essential for [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | functional anatomy]] and [[clinical_implications_of_cranial_nerve_injuries | clinical implications]]. The emergence points differ significantly between the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | ventral]] and dorsal aspects of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Ventral Aspect of the Brain Stem

The [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | ventral aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] provides a clear view of most [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] emergence points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Midbrain Features and Cranial Nerves

*   **Cerebral Peduncle**: This area, highlighted as part of the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | midbrain]], is also known as the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | cerebral peduncle]] or crus cerebri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It contains descending tracts from the cerebrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Third Cranial Nerve (Oculomotor)**: The only nerve seen emerging from the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | cerebral peduncle]], specifically from the interpeduncular fossa, is the third [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The interpeduncular fossa is the space between the two peduncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Associated structures in this fossa include the mammillary bodies and the infundibulum of the pituitary gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear)**: While seen from the front (ventral aspect), the fourth [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] is unique as it is the *only* nerve that emerges from the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It is also the thinnest [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Pons Features and Cranial Nerves

*   **Fifth Cranial Nerve (Trigeminal)**: The fifth [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] is the only nerve emerging from the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | ventral surface]] of the pons, located laterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is a mixed nerve with both a thicker sensory component and a thinner motor component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Medulla Oblongata Features and Cranial Nerves

Key elevations on the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | ventral aspect]] of the medulla oblongata include:
*   **Olive**: An elevation due to the inferior olivary nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Pyramid**: Contains the corticospinal tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Cranial nerves emerging in relation to these structures:
*   **Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Cranial Nerves**: The sixth (Abducens), seventh ([[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | Facial]]), and eighth (Vestibulocochlear) [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerves]] emerge from the ponto-medullary junction, the point where the pons meets the medulla oblongata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Cranial Nerves**: The ninth (Glossopharyngeal), tenth (Vagus), and eleventh (Accessory, including cranial and spinal parts) [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerves]] emerge just lateral, or posterolateral, to the olive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The spinal accessory nerve specifically comes from the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Twelfth Cranial Nerve (Hypoglossal)**: The hypoglossal nerve is the only nerve that emerges between the pyramid and the olive, typically as multiple rootlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Clinical Relevance (Ventral Aspect)

Identifying the exit points of these [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerves]] is crucial for diagnosing [[clinical_implications_of_cranial_nerve_injuries | nerve injuries]].
*   **Third Nerve Palsy**: An injury to the third nerve, emerging from the interpeduncular fossa, can lead to ipsilateral ptosis (drooping eyelid) or divergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Sixth Nerve Palsy**: Injury to the sixth nerve, from the ponto-medullary junction, can result in a convergent squint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Dorsal Aspect of the Brain Stem

The [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] is typically visualized after removing the cerebellum, exposing the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Midbrain Features and Cranial Nerves

*   **Corpora Quadrigemina**: In the [[features_of_the_midbrain_and_cerebral_peduncle | midbrain]] section, four colliculi are visible: the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Together, they are known as the corpora quadrigemina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Geniculate Bodies**: Located behind the thalamus, there are medial and lateral geniculate bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   The **lateral geniculate body** is part of the visual pathway and is connected to the superior colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   The **medial geniculate body** is part of the auditory pathway and is connected to the inferior colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Fourth Cranial Nerve (Trochlear)**: The fourth [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] (trochlear nerve) is the *only* [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] that emerges from the [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Fourth Ventricle and its Floor

The [[the_dorsal_and_ventral_aspects_of_the_brain_stem | dorsal aspect]] of the [[anatomy_of_the_brain_stem | brain stem]] displays the floor of the fourth ventricle, also called the rhomboid fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Boundaries**: The superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles form the boundaries of the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The middle cerebellar peduncle does not contribute to its boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Sulcus Limitans**: A prominent midline sulcus and a lateral sulcus limitans are present in the floor of the fourth ventricle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This sulcus embryologically divides the neural tube into a medial motor area (basal plate) and a lateral sensory area (alar plate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

#### Elevations and Nuclei in the Floor of the Fourth Ventricle:

*   **Medial (Motor) Area**:
    *   **Facial Colliculus**: The most prominent elevation, deep to which lies the sixth (Abducens) nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial nerve]] fibers surround the sixth nucleus, forming this bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   **Hypoglossal Triangle**: An elevation below the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial colliculus]], deep to which the hypoglossal (12th) nucleus is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   **Vagal Triangle**: Located further below, containing the dorsal nucleus of Vagus (10th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   These are all motor nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

*   **Lateral (Sensory) Area**:
    *   **Vestibular Triangle**: Located lateral to the sulcus limitans, containing the vestibular (8th) nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

*   **Cranial Nerve Nuclei in the Floor**: The [[anatomy_of_the_skull_and_cranial_nerves | cranial nerve]] nuclei present in the floor of the fourth ventricle are the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Clinical Relevance (Dorsal Aspect)

*   **Injury to [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | Facial Colliculus]]**: If a tumor or injury affects the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial colliculus]], the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial nerve]] itself is more likely to be affected first than the underlying sixth nucleus, leading to lower motor neuron lesion signs of the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial nerve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This would manifest as paralysis of the muscles of [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial expression]] (e.g., zygomaticus major/minor, mentalis, risorius, orbicularis oculi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. While the sixth nucleus is deep to it, the [[facial_nerve_branches_and_implications_of_surgery | facial nerve]] itself is the direct structure forming the colliculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

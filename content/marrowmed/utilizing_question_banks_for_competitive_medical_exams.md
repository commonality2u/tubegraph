Question banks (Q banks) are an integral part of preparing for competitive medical exams like the FMG and NEET PG, as highlighted by topper Yashaswi who scored 257 in the FMG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His strategy emphasizes their crucial role in reinforcing concepts and identifying areas for improvement.

## Choosing the Right Question Bank

Yashaswi exclusively used the NEET PG Q bank from start to finish, aiming for a score of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He believed giving 100% effort to this comprehensive Q bank would help him achieve his goal and serve him well in his future PG journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Integrating Q Bank Practice with Study

Yashaswiâ€™s [[study_and_preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy]] involved solving questions immediately after completing a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This immediate practice helped trigger his brain to focus on important topics and concepts, including those not previously asked or those that appeared frequently in the Q bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This approach reinforces concepts and helps identify areas requiring more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Strategies for Difficult Topics and Question Review

When encountering difficult modules where he scored less than 70% or 60%, Yashaswi employed specific [[utilization_of_marrow_question_bank_for_competitive_exams | features of the Q bank]] to review and improve:

*   **Bookmarking:** He effectively utilized the three available bookmark features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>:
    *   **Red (or Star) Marks:** For questions answered correctly but with less than 30-50% accuracy by other users, indicating a need for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   **Yellow (Q Mark):** For questions with extensive explanations, providing a theoretical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   **Blue (Simple Mark):** For previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **"Clean Slate" Feature:** This feature allowed him to re-solve the entire Q bank after initially completing about 85% during his college days, ensuring repeated practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Daily Question Practice and Revision

In the last six months leading up to the FMG exam, Yashaswi consistently solved more than 100 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. His daily regimen included:
*   Three custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   50 PYQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   50 questions he got incorrect previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Another 50 questions from a mixed bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

This consistent [[using_question_banks_and_practice_modules | practice of MCQs]] daily is crucial because competitive exams are objective (MCQ-based) rather than theoretical, helping students get a "hang of solving the questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Reviewing Grand Tests (GTs)
Rather than reviewing all questions in a GT, Yashaswi focused only on the incorrect ones, making custom modules from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This strategy aimed to convert incorrect answers into correct ones for future attempts, efficiently reducing the number of questions to revise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Importance of Q Banks in Overall Preparation

Yashaswi recommends that aspiring FMGs complete all study videos during college, as it aids in college exams as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. Once back in India for dedicated exam preparation, the focus should shift heavily towards [[role_of_videos_and_qbanks_in_medical_exam_preparation | solving questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.

He noted that while rapid revision videos are helpful, they might not suffice for trickier, conceptual questions that require deeper understanding from main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:59">[01:56:59]</a>. The comprehensive [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | Q bank practice]] ensures that one is prepared for conceptual questions that rely on detailed knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:01">[01:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:22">[01:58:22]</a>.

> "Only focus on revision videos, solve Q bank, and give GTS. That was my [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | revision strategy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

By integrating Q banks with main videos, revision videos, and [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_mock_tests | Grand Tests]], students can ensure a thorough and targeted [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | preparation strategy]] for competitive medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

The NEET PG 2024 exam featured significant questions related to nutrition, particularly focusing on [[micronutrients|micronutrients]] and their associated deficiency diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Key Nutritional Topics in the Exam

### Micronutrients
Questions were asked about [[micronutrients|micronutrients]] in both sessions of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

#### Thiamine (Vitamin B1)
*   **Sources:** Organ meat (like liver and spleen) is considered the richest source of thiamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Other good sources include nuts, the outer covering of grains (like rice), and pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Brown rice or parboiled rice are identified as the best sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Green leafy vegetables, tomato, and pumpkin are not considered good sources of thiamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

#### Niacin (Vitamin B3)
*   **Deficiency:** Questions were asked about [[vitamin_deficiencies_in_clinical_settings|Vitamin B3 deficiencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, specifically pellagra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Pellagra:** This condition is characterized by the "4 Ds":
    *   Diarrhea (often the first symptom to appear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>
    *   Dermatitis (exfoliative dermatitis on sun-exposed areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>
    *   Dementia (typically the latest symptom to onset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>
    *   Eventually, Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>
*   Pellagra is commonly associated with diets high in maize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

## Related Conditions and Diagnostic Methods

### Anemia
*   The exam included questions related to anemia, particularly in the context of Mother and Child Health programs and adult health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The [[national_health_programs_and_disease_prevention|Anemia Mukt Bharat]] program includes deworming for school-going children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
*   Weekly [[iron_absorption_and_metabolism|iron]] folic acid (IFA) supplements are provided to adults and children as part of public health initiatives, not monthly supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

### Epidemic Dropsy
*   This condition is characterized by sudden onset bilateral swelling of legs, diarrhea, and dyspnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.
*   It is linked to the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with *Argemone mexicana* (sanguinarine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** The best and most sensitive investigation for epidemic dropsy is a chromatography test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. A nitric acid test can also be used, especially in public health settings if chromatography is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

### Plumbism (Lead Poisoning)
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Screening Tests:** Two tests can be used for screening: the CoPro profiling test and urinary ALA (Aminolevulinic acid) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
    *   **Diagnostic Test:** The definitive diagnostic test for plumbism is blood lead levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

### Cholesterol Levels
*   A drug trial assessing the impact of statin therapy on [[metabolic_disorders_and_enzymes|cholesterol levels]] over nine months involved a group of 30 volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   For quantitative data like cholesterol levels, and when comparing before and after measurements within a single group, a parametric test like the paired T-test is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### Nutritional Support in Clinical Settings
*   While not explicitly detailed as a separate section, the discussion on deficiencies and management implies the broader topic of [[nutritional_support_in_surgical_patients|nutritional support]].

### Other Nutritional Aspects
*   **Diet and Disease Relationship:** A study examining the relationship between diet (vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian) and disease incidence uses qualitative, non-parametric data. For comparing two such groups, the Chi-square test is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   The concept of [[understanding_common_conditions_related_to_endocrinology|longevity dividend]] links economic well-being (which can be influenced by good nutrition) to increased lifespan and societal benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. This means a healthier, economically productive population leads to increased life expectancy and further economic and health benefits for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

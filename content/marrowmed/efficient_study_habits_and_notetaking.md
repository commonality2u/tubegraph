Dr. Shreya Gandhi, who scored 244 in his first attempt at the FMG exam, shares his strategies for [[effective_study_strategies_for_medical_exams | effective study strategies]] and [[approaches_to_effective_notetaking_and_revision_techniques | notetaking]], drawing from his experience as a medical graduate from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Starting Early and Resource Selection

Dr. Gandhi emphasizes the importance of starting early in one's preparation, having subscribed to Marrow towards the end of his third year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He recommends not waiting until the final year or returning to India to begin studying, as it is a long journey with a lot of syllabus to cover, and starting late can be a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

He consistently used Marrow resources throughout his preparation, including video lectures, Q-banks, custom modules, and multiple revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. His confidence in Marrow stemmed from its comprehensive nature and the expertise of its faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Video Lecture Consumption

Dr. Gandhi's approach to video lectures was strategic:
*   He started by watching core subjects like Pathology, Obstetrics, and Gynaecology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   He used questions to identify the most important and frequently asked points, which helped him narrow down the vast amount of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   For major subjects (e.g., Obstetrics, Surgery, Ophthalmology, ENT), he completed the main video lectures end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   For shorter subjects, he utilized the revision videos, understanding that the question quantity for these subjects is typically lower (around 5 to 10 questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. His goal was to achieve around 90% accuracy in these shorter subjects using the revision videos, making them a very scoring part of the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He performed multiple [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revisions]] of these shorter subject notes to ensure retention of every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This strategy allowed him to "read less but be sure" of what he read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Notetaking Strategy

Dr. Gandhi opted for printed, ready-made notes instead of creating his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. His [[use_of_bookmarks_and_notetaking_strategies_for_exam_preparation | notetaking strategy]] involved:
*   Initially, in his third and fourth years when he had more time, he would read through all the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   As time became limited, he began marking specific areas in the main notes that were frequently tested in questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   During later revisions, he used these marked areas to navigate the main notes efficiently, focusing only on the important points rather than re-reading everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   He stuck with the main notes throughout, even for last-minute revisions, and felt confident in being able to review them quickly due to repeated exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This approach helped recall where information was located in the notes, fostering a sense of completion and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Question Bank and Grand Tests

Dr. Gandhi emphasized the crucial role of question practice:
*   He always watched videos and read notes *before* attempting questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   He primarily focused on the NEET PG question bank until November 2024, then shifted to the FMG section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   As he had less time for the FMG question bank, he utilized custom modules, applying hashtags like "NEET," "FMG," "clinical," and "most commons" to generate relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   He solved previous year papers multiple times, even when he knew the answers, to ensure reflexive recall and save [[time_management_skills_during_exams | time during the exam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Initially, he used custom modules for single subjects to achieve high accuracy (85-90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Later, he mixed multiple subjects in custom modules to remove subject bias and prepare his mind for random questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Grand Tests (GTs)
*   He started giving GTs in September, after having a solid foundation of knowledge (around 15-16 subjects covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. He believed giving GTs without prior knowledge was demotivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   He gave approximately five to six GTs, initially once a month, aligning them with his [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   After each GT, he meticulously reviewed the analytics to identify weak areas and silly mistakes, especially when getting tougher questions right but easier ones wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. PSM was a consistent challenge due to the sheer volume of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   His review process involved focusing on wrong questions first, bookmarking important ones, and sometimes jotting down points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. He also briefly reviewed correct answers to confirm his thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Daily Study and Support

Dr. Gandhi completed around 10,000-12,000 questions throughout his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He stresses that daily question practice is irreplaceable for improving scores in individual subjects, and GTs are merely a consolidator of information and a total picture of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Time Management and Consistency
*   Regarding [[time_management_and_scheduling_study_sessions | daily study hours]], he suggests dedicating at least an hour on busy days for revision or question solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   On free days, one should put in more hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   Consistency is key: "Every day you have to be doing something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. It's acceptable to take a day off once a week or every 10 days if feeling overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   He also highlights the importance of having a good study partner to make the journey easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

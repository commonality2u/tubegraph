Dr. Shashwat, who secured Rank 2 in the recently conducted INICET exam, shares his strategic approach to balancing demanding internship responsibilities with rigorous exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. His first attempt at INICET came right after completing a "strenuous and tough" internship at MAMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Internship Study Strategy

Initially, the tiring nature of the internship at MAMC meant less study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Dr. Shashwat primarily focused on the QBank, completing subjects he hadn't covered by practicing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Adapting to Posting Demands

His study approach varied depending on the intensity of his internship postings:

*   **Heavy Postings (e.g., Medicine, OBG)**: During day duties, he utilized any available free time to solve QBank questions or review notes on his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This included ready-made notes for subjects he studied from printed materials or looking at pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Even after tiring days or emergencies, he made an effort to study "at least something" to avoid a completely wasted day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Lighter Postings**: He maximized his commute time, studying in the metro (e.g., watching Biochemistry videos he hadn't covered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. He would also study in his college room or library after postings and revise his handmade notes in the evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. QBank solving was simultaneous with his revisions, aiming to complete QBank for a particular topic within one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

This [[balancing_medical_studies_with_internship_responsibilities | utilization of time]], even during travel, helped significantly in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Motivation and Catching Up

Despite having a focused plan, adhering to it perfectly wasn't always possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

> "I kept myself motivated that no I have to try I have to try my best and I have to do it this year itself the first attempt." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>

To [[balancing_internship_and_exam_preparation | catch up]] when lagging behind, he ensured he completed the planned subject, even if it meant shifting his schedule forward by a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. He also incorporated buffer days to cover any lost study time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

This demonstrates a strong commitment to [[balancing_academics_and_personal_life_in_medicine | consistent effort]] and adaptability, crucial for [[balancing_personal_life_and_professional_life_for_medical_students | medical students]] facing heavy workloads.

## Exam Insights
The INIC May surgery exam presented a moderate difficulty, with recurring topics but often confusing options, highlighting the need for detailed and thorough analysis of topics rather than just relying on past year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This means reading topics in detail to answer even the minutest of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Breast Cancer Staging
Breast cancer is a frequent topic in the INIC exam, especially locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and [[TNM staging for breast cancer | breast cancer staging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[TNM classification in surgery | TNM staging]] is crucial, with specific attention to T4 stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

*   **TNM Staging for Breast Cancer:**
    *   **TIS (Carcinoma in Situ):** Includes DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) or Paget's disease; LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma In Situ) is no longer considered an in situ lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **T1:** Tumor size less than or equal to 2 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   **T2:** Tumor size between 2 cm and 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   **T3:** Tumor size greater than 5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **T4A (Chest Wall Involvement):** Involves the serratus anterior, intercostal muscles, and ribs. Pectoralis major muscle involvement is *not* considered chest wall involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **T4B (Skin Involvement):** Includes peau d'orange, satellite nodules, and ulceration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If peau d'orange covers more than one-third of the breast skin, it becomes T4D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Peau d'orange appearance is due to involvement of subdermal lymphatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **T4C:** Combination of T4A and T4B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   **T4D (Inflammatory Breast Cancer):** Occurs when more than one-third of the breast skin has peau d'orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Nodal Staging:**
    *   **N0:** No nodes involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **N1:** Mobile axillary nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   **N2A:** Fixed axillary nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **N2B:** Positive internal mammary lymph nodes with negative axillary nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   **N3A:** Infraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **N3B:** Internal mammary plus axillary lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **N3C:** Supraclavicular lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **M Staging:**
    *   **M0:** No distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   **M1:** Presence of distant metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS)
BCS is a common surgical approach for breast cancer, but certain contraindications exist:
*   **Absolute Contraindications:**
    *   Pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Multicentric disease (lesions in separate quadrants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   Extensive DCIS or microcalcifications involving a large area, making breast preservation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Very large tumor (though neoadjuvant chemotherapy can shrink it to enable BCS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Persistent positive margins (indicating a need to abandon BCS and consider mastectomy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Relative Contraindications:**
    *   Previous history of radiation to the chest wall (radiation is mandatory after BCS, so if previously radiated, BCS is avoided for at least 2 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Active collagen vascular diseases (e.g., scleroderma) due to high risk of radiation burns and side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Lobular cancer, as it tends to be multicentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Tumor involving a single quadrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Multifocal disease (two small lesions) within the same quadrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Genetic Testing in Breast Cancer
For patients with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, genetic testing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **BRCA Gene Testing:** The most common gene involved in familial or hereditary breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   **Indications for BRCA testing:**
        *   Presence of a deleterious gene in a blood relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
        *   Personal history of ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
        *   One or more relatives diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
        *   Personal history of bilateral breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
        *   Triple-negative breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
        *   Male breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Other Genes Linked to Breast Cancer:**
    *   **P10:** Associated with Cowden syndrome, which can involve GI polyps and breast/thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   **TP53:** Linked to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by multiple cancers including breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   **CDH1:** Associated with diffuse gastric cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **BRCA2:** More commonly associated with prostate cancer, male breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer compared to BRCA1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   **STK11:** Linked to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which also increases breast cancer risk (and pancreatic cancer risk by 100 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **RET proto-oncogene:** Causes MEN 2B syndrome, characterized by mucosal neuromas and medullary thyroid cancer, not mucosal neuromas and P-53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Breast Abscess
*   The bacteria responsible for breast abscess, and a common commensal or natural flora of a child's skin, is *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

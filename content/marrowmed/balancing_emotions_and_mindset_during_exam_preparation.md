Maintaining a balanced emotional state and a positive mindset is crucial for success during exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Dr. Vaibhav, the NEET PG 2024 All India Rank One holder, shared insights on managing challenges and staying motivated throughout his rigorous study schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Strategies for Emotional Balance

Dr. Vaibhav's approach to challenges, whether a hectic internship or an unexpected incident, was to "just keep going" and "take it one day at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. He emphasized the need to [[balancing_study_and_personal_wellbeing_during_exam_preparation | keep balance]] during preparation because "every day is not the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Acknowledging Fluctuating Motivation
Some days, a student may feel very positive and capable of dedicating more hours to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, on days when motivation is low, even a small effort like solving a few questions or taking a mini-test can make the day productive and prevent regret over wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | importance of consistency]], even with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Putting Your Heart into Learning
Dr. Vaibhav found enjoyment in the learning process itself. He "put all [his] heart" into studying each subject and enjoyed learning conceptually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This dedication made subjects like Surgery and OB/Gyn favorite topics, especially when taught by engaging faculty who made complex topics understandable and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Leveraging Grand Tests for Motivation
Grand tests became a "favorite learning tool" for Dr. Vaibhav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He even used them when he was bored or unsure what to study, sometimes taking three consecutive grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This enjoyment of tests helped him master [[time_management_skills_during_exams | time-bound MCQ solving skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. A high rank in a mock test, even after night shifts, significantly boosted his confidence, reaffirming his ability to succeed through consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### The Role of a Support System
A strong [[role_of_support_system_in_exam_preparation | support system]] is vital. Dr. Vaibhav credited his parents, grandparents, friends, seniors, and juniors for their belief in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. His parents were his "backbone," offering unwavering support whenever he felt low or was in the "not correct state of mind," helping him overcome fears and providing a sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Mindset Towards the Exam

### Avoiding Emotional Over-attachment
A key piece of advice from Dr. Vaibhav is not to "attach themselves too much emotionally to an exam and not make it life or death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. He views the exam as simply a "transit, a phase of life" from MBBS to post-graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. While it's essential to "put your heart into it" and give your best during preparation, becoming overly emotional about the outcome can be detrimental if things don't go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Embracing the Journey and Consistency
[[Importance of consistency in exam preparation | Consistency]] is paramount throughout the preparation period, which naturally includes ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. On "overcharged" days, one might break study records, while on "struggling" days, even opening a book can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. The focus should be on those challenging days: just solve a few questions, complete a custom module, or take a mini-test to keep the momentum going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Every single MCQ solved contributes to overall knowledge, preparing one for any exam level or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear of Questions
It's important to "enjoy the art of solving questions" and make it a "friend rather than fearing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. The more questions one faces, the more the fear dissipates, making the exam feel like "any other random thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Even solving one question a day is more progress than doing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. By starting early, being consistent, and focusing on fundamentals, success is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

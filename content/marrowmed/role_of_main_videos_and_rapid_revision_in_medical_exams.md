Yashaswi, the highest scorer in this year's FMG exam with 257 out of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, utilized Marrow's video resources extensively throughout his preparation. His strategy involved a phased approach to [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | video lectures]], progressing from in-depth main videos to concise rapid revision sessions.

## Main Videos for Foundational Understanding

Yashaswi began using Marrow after completing his fourth year of MBBS, around 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. His initial approach was to watch all the main videos at his own pace, focusing on building concepts without rushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This early start provided the advantage of absorbing information at ease and establishing a strong conceptual base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

He recommends that FMG students try to complete all the main videos while still in college. This not only helps with college exams by providing concepts for theory material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>, but also allows them to focus more on questions once they return to India for dedicated exam preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

## Rapid Revision Videos for Consolidation

In his final year, Yashaswi transitioned to watching rapid revision videos. These were crucial for concising all the material he had studied over the previous two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. During his dedicated six-month preparation period before the FMG exam, his [[effective_revision_strategies_for_medical_exams | revision strategy]] primarily involved:
*   Watching rapid revision videos once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   Getting the rapid revision notes printed out and reading them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.
*   Avoiding re-watching videos during this intensive revision phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   Focusing on solving QBank questions and taking Grand Tests (GTS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

He aimed for four to five revisions using this method and succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

## The Interplay of Main and Rapid Revision Videos for Exam Success

While rapid revision videos are excellent for condensing material, Yashaswi notes that for a tricky exam, they might not suffice for all questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. The FMG exam he appeared for contained both superficial and very deep questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. To answer these conceptual questions correctly, a student must have a thorough understanding from the main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

Yashaswi emphasizes that if a student is aiming for a score above 200, their concepts must be well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. While rapid revision videos can be helpful for minor subjects, main subjects require the depth provided by the main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. Success hinges on being focused and applying concepts learned from all video resources during the examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

### Use of Pearls

Yashaswi also used Marrow's "Pearls" feature for topics that were confusing in his notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. For minor subjects, he watched all the Pearls videos, finding the images, tables, and charts very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaway

Yashaswi's success highlights that a balanced approach using both comprehensive main videos for conceptual clarity and concise rapid revision videos for effective [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision]] is crucial for achieving top scores in medical exams like the FMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. Students should build a strong foundation early and then systematically revise using targeted resources.

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), also known as nicotine supplementation, is one of two major strategies for [[tobacco_cessation_strategies | tobacco cessation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The goal of NRT is to provide purified nicotine from an external source to help patients reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving during their journey to quit nicotine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This approach offers a significant advantage by stopping exposure to the approximately 4,000 chemicals found in a single cigarette, providing a much safer alternative by delivering only the addictive component, nicotine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy
Different forms of NRT are available:
*   **Gums** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   **Lozenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   **Patches** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

### Dosage
*   Gums and lozenges are typically available in 2 mg and 4 mg strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Patches are available as 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Forms

#### Patches
*   **Advantages**: Patches are very easy to use; they can be applied and left for 24 hours before changing to a new one the next day, requiring less effort from the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Side Effects**: Generally well-tolerated, with occasional reports of local allergy or sleep disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

#### Gums
*   **Disadvantages**: Patients must constantly chew the gum, which can lead to oral ulcers, jaw pain, or mouth soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Proper Usage of Nicotine Gums
Proper instruction for using nicotine gums is crucial because they are available over-the-counter and patients may not use them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The recommended method is the "chew and park" method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Chew and Park Method
1.  Begin chewing the gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
2.  Once nicotine starts entering the mouth, it causes a burning or tingling sensation in the mucosal layer, indicating rising nicotine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
3.  Do not swallow the juice from the gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Swallowing reduces nicotine absorption and bioavailability, making the medication less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It can also cause gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, or retrosternal burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
4.  After using the gum, avoid hot beverages, water, or food for approximately 15 to 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Immediate consumption of these items can deactivate the nicotine or cause it to be swallowed, leading to ineffectiveness or side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

In addition to NRT, other pharmacological agents are used to manage nicotine craving:
*   **Varenicline**: Considered the most effective medication for nicotine cessation. It acts as an alpha-4 beta-2 partial agonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Bupropion**: An antidepressant that increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels, which helps reduce craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. It should be used with caution in patients with a history or risk of seizures, as it can decrease the seizure threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Proximal femoral fracture devices are surgical implants used to stabilize fractures occurring in the upper part of the femur. These devices are primarily used for [[inter_trochanteric_fracture | intertrochanteric fractures]] or extracapsular neck of femur fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The main purpose of these devices is to prevent complications such as malunion, specifically [[coxa_vara | coxa vara]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Types of Devices

### Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS)
The Dynamic Hip Screw is an implant consisting of a plate with a mobile, sliding screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This screw is sometimes referred to as a Richard screw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. When a Dynamic Hip Screw is used in compression mode, it leads to [[types_of_fracture_healing_and_fixation_methods | primary healing]] of the fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Primary healing involves rigid fixation with absolute stability and compression at the fracture site, typically without callus formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

### Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN)
The Proximal Femoral Nail is an intramedullary device where the nail is inserted into the medullary cavity of the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It features two proximal screws designed to maintain the neck-shaft angle, thereby preventing the development of [[coxa_vara | coxa vara]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Fractures fixed with a Proximal Femoral Nail typically heal via [[types_of_fracture_healing_and_fixation_methods | secondary healing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. This occurs because the device allows for some relative or micromovement at the fracture site, which promotes callus formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Secondary healing is often considered a stronger and more visually evident form of healing on X-rays due to the presence of callus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

## Fracture Healing Mechanisms

Different fixation methods influence the type of [[terminologies_in_fracture_healing | fracture healing]]:
*   **Primary Healing** occurs with rigid fixation and absolute stability, usually by compression plating or lag screws, with no callus formation and by intramembranous healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   **Secondary Healing** occurs with relatively stable fixation, allowing some micromovement at the fracture site. This type of healing involves callus formation and is seen with non-rigid fixations, braces, external fixation, bridge plating, and intramedullary nailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

The November 2024 INICET recall questions in [[community_medicine_in_neetpg | Community Medicine]] placed a significant emphasis on public health, including [[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | national health programs]] and preventive medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. There was a notable number of questions from these areas, covering topics such as Zika prevention, COVID-19 prevention, malaria diagnosis and treatment, water-based diseases, and HIV prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## HIV Prevention

The high-risk core groups for HIV transmission include IV drug users, female sex workers, and men having sex with men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Long-distance truck drivers are categorized as a "bridge population" rather than a high-risk core group, as per the HIV protocol and the [[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | National AIDS and STD Control Program]] 2021-2026 guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Water-Based Diseases

Among the various types of hepatitis, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E are identified as water-borne diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Malaria Management

For malaria detection in the field or at the community level, the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. According to the [[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | National Vector Borne Disease Control Program]]'s national strategic action plan for malaria elimination (2023-2027), RDTs are the primary test at the community level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Microscopy is used if RDT is unavailable or negative with clinical suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. At PC, CHC, or hospital levels, microscopy is the investigation of choice, with RDTs reserved for emergency situations due to a higher false positivity rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria management commonly uses treatments like Artesunate, Artemether, and Primaquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Chloroquine is generally not used for uncomplicated falciparum malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## COVID-19 Prevention

Preventive measures for COVID-19 include wearing masks and vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Ivermectin is not used for COVID-19 prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

## Zika Virus Prevention

For Zika virus prevention, key measures include sexual abstinence, using condoms, and delaying pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Other important preventive strategies involve mosquito elimination (vector control), community awareness, isolation of patients during the first seven days of illness, and testing of pregnant females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. There is currently no FDA-approved vaccine for Zika <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Adult Vaccination Guidelines

According to CDC guidelines adopted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for adult vaccination in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>:
*   COVID-19 and Influenza vaccines are recommended for people aged 65 years and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   The Tdap vaccine is part of the Indian program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   Shingles vaccine is optional in India for adult immunization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   Pneumococcal vaccines (PCV or PPV23) are given to those aged 65 years and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is approved only for ages 19 to 45 years and is not part of the adult immunization recommendations for those over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Vaccine Types

Hepatitis B vaccine is a recombinant vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, unlike Rotavirus, Measles, and Varicella vaccines which are live vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

Passive immunity is induced by pre-formed antibodies, such as immunoglobulins or maternal antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Toxoids, like tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid, induce active immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Universal Health Coverage (UHC)

Universal Health Coverage aims to provide quality healthcare to all people and communities without financial hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. Its purpose is to ensure healthcare access for everyone, regardless of a country's income or financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. The Ayushman Bharat program in India, providing 5 lakh rupees health insurance cover to 50 crore people (10 crore families), exemplifies a national effort towards UHC through a comprehensive healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## [[nutrition_and_deficiency_diseases | Nutrition and Deficiency Diseases]]

### Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)

The criteria for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>:
*   Low weight-for-height (less than -3 standard deviations), indicating acute malnutrition or wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.
*   Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 11.5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   Bilateral pedal edema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

Low height-for-age, also known as stunting, indicates chronic malnutrition and is not a direct criterion for SAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

### Anemia Mukt Bharat

[[national_health_programs_for_communicable_and_noncommunicable_diseases | Anemia Mukt Bharat]] is a 6x6x6 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. This program, managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development alongside the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>, identifies six eligible beneficiaries, six institutions, and six interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. However, "six health functionaries" are not part of the Anemia Mukt Bharat criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

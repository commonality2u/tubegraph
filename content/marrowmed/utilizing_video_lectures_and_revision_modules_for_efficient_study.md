Dr. Akshhat Koshik, who achieved Rank 8 in the INI CET May 2025 exam, describes his approach to efficient study, emphasizing the foundational role of [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | video lectures]] and strategic use of [[revision_techniques_and_managing_study_notes | revision modules]] and notes. His method focused on deep understanding and building a strong clinical base early in his MBBS journey, rather than solely concentrating on the PG exam from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Early Preparation with Video Lectures

Dr. Akshhat began using [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | Marrow videos]] from his second year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. His strategy was to watch a manageable number of videos (1-3 per day) to absorb knowledge without feeling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This approach allowed the information to "sink in" and interconnect naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, forming a low-energy task that built a strong clinical foundation throughout his MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

By the end of his final year, he had completed watching all the main videos, focusing purely on understanding the content, without simultaneously engaging with question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This early immersion in [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | video lectures]] significantly enhanced his clinical understanding during hospital postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. For instance, his understanding of integrated physiology and medicine concepts, such as the Frank-Starling law and various pulse types learned from Dr. Rakkesh Nayasar's cardio videos, proved crucial years later in the INICT exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Note-Taking and Revision Strategy

Dr. Akshhat utilized hard copy notes provided by Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Given his poor handwriting and dislike for extensive writing, he primarily used these pre-printed notes. His personal touch involved adding extra information or simplified explanations directly onto the notes, especially for difficult concepts or faculty-specific mnemonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. This personalization made the notes more memorable and accessible for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. He emphasized using the same notes for all revisions to benefit from photographic memory, knowing exactly where specific information was located on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## Intensive Final Preparation (Last 4-5 Months)

Dr. Akshhat's intensive preparation began only in the last 4-5 months leading up to the exam, mainly after his internship concluded in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. During this period, his strategy focused on:

*   **[[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | Revision Videos]]:** These formed the backbone of his final preparation, with minor additions to his personalized notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs):** He solved all 285 PYQs to the fullest extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. He recognized that 130-140 questions in the INI CET exam are often repackaged versions of previous exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. He solved 8-9 years of PYQs for both NEET PG and INI CET, noting their inter-connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **[[utilizing_custom_modules_for_exam_preparation | Custom Modules]] (Q-banks):** While he had rarely used the Q-bank before, in the last six months, he extensively used [[utilizing_custom_modules_for_exam_preparation | custom modules]] for [[utilizing_digital_tools_and_q_banks_for_exam_preparation | testing ability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. He would attempt modules of 25-50 questions even while walking or in a cab, viewing it as optimizing thinking under time pressure rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. He selected tags like "PYQs," "all," "image-based," or "INI CET only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.
*   **[[utilizing_grand_tests_and_custom_modules_for_exam_readiness | Grand Tests (GTs)]]:** He gave 8-9 GTs starting from February, consistently improving his scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. He spent more time reviewing the GTs than taking them, analyzing all 200 questions (200 topics) to solidify concepts, even for questions he answered correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

## Categorizing Study Methods

Dr. Akshhat advises categorizing study methods into high, middle, and low energy tasks to manage exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. For example:
*   **High Energy:** Watching a [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | video]] for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.
*   **Low Energy:** Watching a delta revision or delta MCQ [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | video]] for a subject already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.
This allows students to choose appropriate tasks even when mentally tired, optimizing study hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

## Importance of Clinical Experience

Beyond [[role_of_main_videos_and_rapid_revision_in_medical_exams | videos]] and [[utilizing_digital_tools_and_q_banks_for_exam_preparation | digital tools]], Dr. Akshhat emphasized the value of clinical experience during internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He viewed his internship as a clinical revision of previously learned material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>. Real-world cases, like diagnosing and treating hypothyroidism or Kawasaki disease, solidified his knowledge deeply, making it a reflex rather than requiring conscious revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. This integrated learning approach highlights the [[benefits_of_integrated_video_lectures_and_notes | benefits of integrated video lectures and notes]] with practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.

## Mental Approach to Exams

Dr. Akshhat stresses the importance of a calm mindset before and during the exam. He advises dedicating the day before the exam to relaxation, talking to friends and family, watching a movie, and sleeping without stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. He highlights that managing self-doubt and winning the "battle with yourself" is more crucial than the final rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. The goal should be to focus on the process and give one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

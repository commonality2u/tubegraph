Pain receptors, known as nociceptors, are specialized sensory neurons that respond to noxious stimuli, signaling potential harm to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These receptors are crucial for the sensation of pain.

## Types of Stimuli and Nociceptor Response

Various stimuli can activate nociceptors, with different outcomes:
*   **Pin Prick Stimulus** Pin pricks, typically administered with a needle, are commonly used in central nervous system (CNS) examinations to check for pain sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A pin prick directly stimulates pain receptors, leading to a pain sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The firing from nociceptors increases when stimulated by a pin prick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Tooth Force Subs** Similar to pin pricks, tooth force subsidence is also used to assess pain sensation in CNS examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Applying tooth force significantly stimulates pain receptors, resulting in maximum pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, as evidenced by maximal nociceptor firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Blunt Object/Blunt Force** In contrast to sharp or pointed stimuli, blunt force does not typically stimulate nociceptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While a blunt object applies pressure sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, it does not elicit a pain response from nociceptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Instead, pressure sensation, a form of deep touch, can activate other mechanoreceptors like [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | Pacinian corpuscles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Pain Fiber Types
*   **A-delta fibers** are responsible for transmitting "sharp pain" or "first pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **C fibers** are associated with "slow pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Conclusion
Understanding the specific responses of nociceptors to different stimuli is fundamental to assessing pain pathways and related neurological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

From: [[marrowmed]] <br/> 

The November 2024 INICET exam's pathology section was noted as moderate to severe in difficulty, depending on the number of revisions undertaken by students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The questions were not direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Approximately 20 to 25 questions, with overlaps, were from pathology, highlighting its significant weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Pathology is considered a core subject that connects various medical fields like medicine, surgery, and gynaecology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As with all INICET exams, a majority of questions are derived from first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While the number of direct repeat questions was less, the underlying topics were frequently repeated across both INICET and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

> Students are advised to study topics thoroughly and in detail due to this repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Topic-wise Distribution

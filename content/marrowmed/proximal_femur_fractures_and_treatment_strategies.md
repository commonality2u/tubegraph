Proximal femur fractures are a common orthopedic concern, frequently tested in medical examinations. These fractures are broadly categorized based on their location relative to the hip joint capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Types of Proximal Femur Fractures

*   **Intracapsular Neck of Femur Fracture:** This type of fracture occurs inside the capsule of the hip joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It is also simply referred to as a neck of femur fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Intertrochanteric Fracture:** This fracture passes through the intertrochanteric region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It is considered an extracapsular neck of femur fracture as it is located outside the hip joint capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## [[fracture_management_strategies | Treatment Strategies]] for Intracapsular Neck of Femur Fractures

The [[fracture_management_strategies | treatment strategy]] for intracapsular neck of femur fractures primarily depends on the patient's age and the duration of the fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Patients Less Than 65 Years Old

For patients under 65 years old, the approach considers the fracture's recency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>:
*   **Fresh Fracture (Less than 3 weeks):** The standard [[fracture_management_strategies | treatment]] is [[types_of_fracture_healing_and_fixation_methods | closed reduction internal fixation]] with canulated cancellous screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Closed reduction is preferred to avoid opening the hip joint capsule, which could dislodge the fracture hematoma and hinder [[terminologies_in_fracture_healing | fracture healing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Typically, about three screws are used to stabilize the fracture after reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Old Fracture (More than 3 weeks):** The viability of the femoral head is assessed, often with an MRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **If the head is not viable:** The fracture is still fixed, and procedures are performed to increase the vascularity of the femoral head, such as Meyer's procedure, Bakshi's procedure, fibular vascularized graft, or muscle pedicle graft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **If the head is viable (to prevent or treat non-union):** The fracture is fixed, and osteotomies like McMurray's and Pauwels's osteotomy may be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Patients More Than 65 Years Old

For patients over 65 years old, joint replacement is the primary [[fracture_management_strategies | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
*   **Ideally:** [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices | Hemi arthroplasty]] (also known as hemi replacement) is performed, where only the head and neck of the femur are replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Common prostheses used include bipolar, Austin Moore, and Thompson, with bipolar often considered the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **With Pre-existing Hip Conditions:** If the patient has a pre-existing hip condition like osteoarthritis, a [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices | total hip replacement]] may be performed. This involves replacing not only the head and neck of the femur but also the acetabular cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[fracture_management_strategies | Treatment Strategies]] for Intertrochanteric (Extracapsular) Femur Fractures

Intertrochanteric fractures, being extracapsular, commonly result in malunion and may heal in coxa vara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Coxa vara can lead to a Trendelenburg limp or gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. To prevent malunion and maintain the neck-shaft angle, specific [[proximal_femoral_fracture_devices | devices]] are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
*   **Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN):** This device features an intramedullary nail with proximal screws that are inserted into the neck to maintain the neck-shaft angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS):** This device consists of a screw inserted into the neck and head, coupled with a plate that helps maintain the neck-shaft angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This device has been featured in recent exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

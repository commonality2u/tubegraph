In the INIC 2024 November psychiatric question, a simple match-the-following format included drugs used for various conditions, including smoking cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Brief Intervention: The 5 A's

A key strategy for tobacco cessation is the "Five A's" brief intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
*   **Ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>: Inquire if every patient smokes or uses nicotine in any form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Advise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>: Recommend and assertively advise those who use nicotine to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Assess** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>: For those who smoke, further assess the level, frequency, and reasons for nicotine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Assist** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>: Provide assistance to help them quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Arrange** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>: Arrange for follow-up appointments to make the patient accountable and increase motivation to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This step is crucial for fighting out [[drug_withdrawal_effects_and_management | withdrawal symptoms]] and getting necessary help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## [[nicotine_replacement_therapy | Nicotine Replacement Therapy]] (NRT)

[[nicotine_replacement_therapy | Nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT), also known as nicotine supplementation, is a major strategy for tobacco cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Forms and Dosages
*   **Gums and Lozenges**: Commonly available as 2 mg and 4 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Patches**: Available as 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Mechanism of Action
A single cigarette contains about 4,000 chemicals, but nicotine is the chemical responsible for addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. NRT provides purified nicotine from an external source, which helps to reduce [[drug_withdrawal_effects_and_L | withdrawal symptoms]] and craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. By using NRT, patients avoid exposure to the other 4,000 harmful chemicals found in cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Administration of Nicotine Gums
Nicotine gums should be used with a specific method called the "chew and park" method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>:
1.  Start chewing the gum.
2.  Once a burning or tingling sensation occurs in the mouth (indicating nicotine release), "park" the gum between the cheek and gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  Do not swallow the juice, as it reduces nicotine absorption and can cause gastric irritation, nausea, or vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
4.  After using the gum, patients should avoid hot beverages, water, or food for approximately 15 to 30 minutes, as these can deactivate the nicotine or make it ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Advantages of Patches over Gums
Patches are generally well-tolerated and easy to use, as they are applied once for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Gums, however, require constant chewing, which can lead to oral ulcers, jaw pain, or mouth soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## [[pharmacological_management_of_nicotine_addiction | Pharmacological Management of Nicotine Addiction]]

In addition to NRT, [[pharmacological_management_of_nicotine_addiction | anti-craving medications]] are used for nicotine cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Varenicline
*   **Effectiveness**: Considered the most effective medication for reducing nicotine craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Acts as an alpha-4 beta-2 partial agonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Bupropion
*   **Mechanism**: Increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain, which helps reduce craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. It is an antidepressant that does not affect serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Should be used with caution in patients with a history or risk of seizures, as it can decrease the seizure threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

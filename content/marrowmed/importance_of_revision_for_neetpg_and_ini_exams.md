Revision is consistently highlighted as the most crucial aspect in the final days leading up to the NEET PG and INI CET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It addresses common problems students face nearing the end of their preparation and is essential given the limited time remaining, typically around 80 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Why Revision is Crucial
Effective revision helps to:
*   Consolidate previously learned knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Improve scores by strengthening weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Develop crucial exam-taking skills, which differ from theoretical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   Reduce anxiety and fear associated with exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   Maintain existing knowledge while selectively adding new, relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

## Revision Strategies for NEET PG and INI CET

### Exam Dates and Planning
The INI CET exam is scheduled for May 17th, and the NEET PG exam is on June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Students should plan their [[exam_pattern_and_preparation_strategies_for_neet_pg_2024 | preparation strategies]] with these dates in mind and not rely on postponements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

*   **Target INI CET**: Aim to complete one full revision before the INI CET exam, which leaves about a month for further revision before NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Success in INI CET can provide significant confidence or even eliminate the need to appear for NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Structured Revision Phases**:
    *   **Before INI CET (15-20 days)**: Focus more on first and second-year subjects, as they are often determining factors for INI CET ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   **Post-INI CET (until NEET PG)**: Shift focus towards clinical subjects, which are more emphasized in NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Address Weak Areas Early**: Do not postpone studying weak subjects until the very end, as anxiety can hinder proper assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Incorporating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
MCQs are the mainstay of preparation in the final 80 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Daily Practice**: Aim to solve at least 100 questions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Broadly, allocate time for notes and MCQs in a 60:40 or 50:50 ratio at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Students with pending subjects may need more time on notes but should still do MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Maintain Exam Skills**: Continuously practice MCQs from various subjects to maintain and improve your exam-taking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Utilizing Marrow Resources

#### Revision Videos
*   **Main Video Notes**: If you have already completed and are comfortable with your main video notes, stick to them for revision. Do not switch to revision notes due to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), as new notes may take longer to assimilate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Purpose of Revision Videos**:
    *   For students who have missed subjects or find it difficult to finish regular videos, revision videos offer focused content in less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   For short subjects, revision videos are designed to be almost as comprehensive as regular videos, providing relevant points and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   For major subjects, if you are short on time, it is advisable to stick to revision videos supplemented with Qbank and MCQ discussion videos to cover 75-80% of questions correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Teacher Guidance**: Teachers provide introductory videos for each subject's revision series, indicating if new or modified content is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

#### MCQ Discussion Videos
MCQ discussion videos are designed as an interactive learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Interactive Testing**: Approach these videos as subject-wise tests. Attempt the questions sincerely, pause to think, and answer before listening to the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Targeted Learning**: If you answer correctly with sound logic, you can skip the explanation and move to the next question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:20:03]</a>. If you guessed or were incorrect, listen to the detailed explanation to understand the reasoning and potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Content**: These videos cover frequently asked and recently tested topics, including previous year questions (though often rephrased and redesigned to touch relevant areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:23]</a>. They help students identify frequently tested areas and link clinical scenarios to answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **GT Discussion Questions**: MCQ discussion videos also include discussions of difficult Grand Test (GT) questions that many students get wrong, providing insight into complex reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:22:09]</a>.

#### Grand Tests (GTs)
[[importance_of_revision_and_grand_tests | Grand Tests (GTs)]] are an integral part of [[strategies_for_neet_pg_preparation | NEET PG preparation]] and should be started early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Once a week is ideal; twice a week or twice in 10 days at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:41]</a>. Daily GTs are not recommended as they consume too much revision time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: GTs simulate the real exam, helping you develop exam skills, manage time, and overcome the fear of appearing for a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:14]</a>. They allow you to fine-tune your exam strategy, including how many questions to attempt and when to guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   **Effective GT Review**:
    1.  **Correct with Sound Reasoning**: Skip these questions; you already know the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:54]</a>.
    2.  **Unknown Factual Questions**: If it's a factual question rarely asked and with low correct percentage, read once and ignore. If it's a factual question that many students got correct, bookmark it and add it to your notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:25]</a>.
    3.  **Conceptual/Guessed Questions**: For conceptual questions or those you guessed correctly, read the explanation and bookmark/add to notes for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:46]</a>.
    *   GT review should take about 2-3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **Improving GT Score**:
    *   **Revision of Weak Subjects**: Utilize the GT analysis to identify subjects bringing your score down and revise them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:23]</a>.
    *   **Correct Answering Strategy**: Engage with GT discussion videos to understand faculty's approach to questions and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Balance**: Maintain knowledge you've acquired while continuously adding new information from areas you haven't read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:52:01]</a>.

#### Custom Modules
Custom modules allow personalized practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   **Exam Simulation**: A 40-question custom module in exam mode now provides 42 minutes for completion, simulating the actual exam timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Tag Selection**: Prioritize "must-do" tags such as recent NEET, clinical questions, conceptual questions, recent updates, and image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Create custom modules for your weak subjects or specific challenging topics (e.g., staging of cancers, instruments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:22]</a>.

### Managing New Information and Notes
*   **Stop Adding New Info**: In the last 45 days before the exam, avoid adding any new information to your notes unless it's a previously asked question that you consistently get wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Focus on Previously Tested**: Master topics tested in the last five years. If you missed any, add them now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:59]</a>.
*   **Pearls**: Utilize "Pearls" as a quick revision tool for fragmented facts or information that is easily forgotten or confused between subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:57:05]</a>.

### Dynamic 20th Notebook (Alternative to Traditional Notebooks)
*   **Avoid New Physical Notebooks**: It's not the time to start a traditional 20th notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Digital Approach**: Create private WhatsApp or Telegram groups for each subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Content**: Take screenshots of challenging concepts, images, or difficult questions, and add them to the relevant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Revision**: When you've mastered a concept or image, delete it from the group. This leaves you with a filtered, personalized collection of your weak areas for quick revision in the last 10-15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:53]</a>. This method saves time compared to writing notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:02:05]</a>.

### General Tips for [[strategies_for_neet_pg_exam | Exam Preparation]]
*   **Consistency**: Maintain daily consistency in your studies and revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:56]</a>. This means studying even when you don't feel like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:23">[01:03:45]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Sleep and Health**: Ensure adequate sleep, eat healthy, stay hydrated, and consider multivitamins (D3, B12) if deficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:48:04]</a>.
*   **Breaks**: Integrate short breaks during long study sessions (e.g., Pomodoro technique: 30-45 minutes study, 5-10 minutes break) and take longer breaks weekly to recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations**: Set clear, realistic expectations for your rank based on your effort and preparation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:48]</a>. Avoid comparing yourself to others, as everyone has different backgrounds and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Stick to One Source**: Avoid new courses or materials in the last few months to prevent overwhelm. Trust your chosen process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:34]</a>.

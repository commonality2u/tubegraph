## Introduction to ADHD Management
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often managed with medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:12">[04:52:12]</a>. The two main classes of medications used for ADHD are stimulants and non-stimulants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:23">[05:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:15">[05:04:15]</a>.

## Stimulant Medications for ADHD
Stimulants are generally more effective but carry a higher addictive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:01">[05:20:01]</a>. Caution is advised when prescribing stimulants to patients with a history of substance addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, in which case non-stimulants may be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:03">[05:39:03]</a>.

In India, methylphenidate is the available stimulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:27">[05:41:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:47">[09:09:47]</a>. Other stimulants, like amphetamine salts (e.g., L-dexamphetamine, dexamphetamine), are considered more effective but also have greater addictive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:20">[06:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:04">[06:25:04]</a>.

Methylphenidate acts by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, thereby indirectly increasing their levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:20">[06:41:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:11">[07:02:11]</a>. Amphetamines also block reuptake but additionally increase the direct release of dopamine, contributing to their higher addictive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:21">[07:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:15">[07:17:15]</a>.

## Non-Stimulant Medications for ADHD
Non-stimulants are an alternative, especially when stimulants are contraindicated or less preferred. This class includes:
*   **Selective Nor Epinnephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>
*   **Alpha-2 Agonists** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:09">[08:45:09]</a>

### Selective Nor Epinnephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)
SNRIs work by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine. Key SNRIs for ADHD include:
*   **Atomoxetine:** This is an important SNRI for ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:14">[08:14:14]</a>. It is often a preferred choice for prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>.
*   **Reboxetine:** While mentioned as an SNRI, it is less commonly used and not FDA approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:04">[08:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:25">[08:23:25]</a>.
*   **Viloxazine:** This is a newer FDA-approved drug in the SNRI class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:52">[08:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:02">[08:34:02]</a>.

### Alpha-2 Agonists
These are also non-stimulant FDA-approved drugs used in ADHD management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:34">[08:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:40">[08:43:40]</a>. Examples include Clonidine and Guanfacine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:07">[08:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>.

## Prognosis and Comorbidities of Untreated ADHD
ADHD is more common in boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:19">[29:54:19]</a>. If left untreated, hyperactivity often improves with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:22">[30:18:22]</a>. However, attention issues and impulsivity frequently persist into adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:25">[30:37:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:48">[30:40:48]</a>.

Untreated ADHD can lead to several comorbid conditions:
*   **Childhood/Adolescence:**
    *   Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:13">[31:01:13]</a>
    *   Conduct Disorder (CD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:36">[31:15:36]</a>, characterized by deceitful, manipulative, destructive, or defiant behaviors lasting over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.
*   **Adulthood:**
    *   Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:01">[31:25:01]</a>
    *   Anxiety disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:37">[31:33:37]</a>
    *   Substance use disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:09">[31:36:09]</a>
    *   Mood disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:13">[31:39:13]</a>

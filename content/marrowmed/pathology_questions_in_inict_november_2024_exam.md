This article provides an analysis of the [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam | pathology questions]] asked in the [[microbiology_mcqs_from_inicet_november_2024 | INICET November 2024]] exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Exam Overview
The difficulty level of the [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam | pathology questions]] in the INICET November 2024 exam was generally considered moderate, depending on the number of revisions undertaken by the student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Most students described the paper as not direct or very easy, but rather moderate to severe in difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Approximately 20 to 25 questions, including overlaps with other subjects, were from [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam | pathology]], which is a significant number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Subject Importance
INICET exams typically emphasize first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As a core subject connecting [[medicine_subject_focus_in_inicet_exams | medicine]], surgery, and gynaecology, [[pathology_question_analysis_for_inicet_exam | pathology]] proved to be very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Repeat Topics
While the number of direct repeat questions was less, the topics themselves were frequently repeated between INICET and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

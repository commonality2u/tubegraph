Papulosquamous diseases are defined as chronic inflammatory conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">[02:19:08]</a>. The term "papulosquamous" indicates the presence of both papules (small, solid, raised lesions) and scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.

## Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris (PRP)

Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a chronic inflammatory papulosquamous disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:08">[02:19:08]</a>. The name itself provides clues to its characteristics:
*   **Pityriasis** means scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.
*   **Rubra** means red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>.
*   **Pilaris** refers to hair follicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:01">[02:38:01]</a>.

### Clinical Features
*   Presents with an orange hue over the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   Skin is rough and scaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   Classic presentation includes follicular papules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:01">[02:41:01]</a>.
*   Often seen with orange-red erythema that typically proceeds in a cephalo-caudal direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>.
*   Can involve more than 90% of the body surface area, leading to erythroderma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>.
*   A very classical feature of erythroderma in PRP is the presence of "islands of sparing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:01">[03:14:01]</a>.
*   Hyperkeratosis of the palms is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### Histopathology
*   Shows ortho and parakeratosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>, which is described as a "checkerboard pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:01">[03:39:01]</a>.
    *   This pattern implies alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in both horizontal and vertical directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:01">[03:50:01]</a>.
    *   **Orthokeratosis** is normal keratinization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:01">[04:09:01]</a>.
    *   **Parakeratosis** is the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum (nucleated stratum corneum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:01">[04:14:01]</a>.

## Differential Diagnosis of Papulosquamous Disorders

When a child presents with orange hue and rough, scaly skin, along with palm hyperkeratosis and ortho/parakeratosis on [[dermatopathology | histopathology]], the following should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>:

### Follicular [[psoriasis_and_seronegative_arthropathy | Psoriasis]]
*   While thickening of palms and soles can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>, the orange hue is generally not a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
*   Ortho and parakeratosis on [[dermatopathology | histopathology]] are usually not seen in [[psoriasis_and_seronegative_arthropathy | Psoriasis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

### Reactive Arthritis
*   Can present with thickening of the palms and soles, referred to as **keratoderma blennorrhagicum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.
*   Diagnosis usually requires clues suggesting acquisition via sexual or gastrointestinal (GI) infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>.

### Keratosis Follicularis (Darier Disease)
*   Also known as Darier disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   Typically presents as dirty, warty, greasy papules, predominantly over seborrheic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

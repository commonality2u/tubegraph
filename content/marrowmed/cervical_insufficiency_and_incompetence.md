Cervical insufficiency, also known as cervical incompetence, refers to the spontaneous dilation of the cervix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Normally, the internal os of the cervix remains closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In cases of cervical insufficiency, the internal os automatically dilates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, which can lead to second-trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation

Patients with cervical insufficiency or incompetence typically present with a history of painless, recurrent second-trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These abortions are always painless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## [[diagnosis_of_cervical_incompetence | Diagnosis of Cervical Incompetence]]

A diagnosis of cervical incompetence can be made based on history or ultrasound findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### History-Based Diagnosis
If a patient reports a history of two or more painless second-trimester abortions, this is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of cervical insufficiency, and no further investigations are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Ultrasound-Based Diagnosis
If there is a history of only one second-trimester painless abortion, a transvaginal sonography (TVS) is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. TVS is considered the investigation of choice for cervical incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Key ultrasound findings include:
*   **Cervical Length**: The length of the cervix is less than or equal to 2.5 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In a normal pregnant female, the cervical length is typically 4 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Cervical Shape Changes**: As the cervix dilates, its shape changes progressively:
    1.  Normally T-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    2.  Becomes Y-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    3.  Then V-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    4.  Finally, it becomes U-shaped when it dilates and becomes part of the lower uterine segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A U-shaped cervix is characteristic of cervical insufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | Management of Cervical Insufficiency]]

The primary options for [[management_of_cervical_insufficiency | management of cervical insufficiency]] are progesterone and [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Progesterone is always given in conjunction with cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Management Scenarios:
*   **History of two or more second-trimester abortions**:
    *   No ultrasound needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   Proceed directly with [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] plus progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **History of one second-trimester abortion**:
    *   Measure cervical length via TVS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
        *   If cervical length is ≤ 2.5 cm: Perform [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | cervical cerclage]] plus progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
        *   If cervical length is > 2.5 cm: Give only progesterone (cerclage is not indicated in this scenario) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **No history of abortion, but cervical length is ≤ 2.5 cm (coincidental finding)**:
    *   Only progesterone is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cervical cerclage]] is not justified without a history of second-trimester abortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cervical Circlage Techniques and Indications]]

[[cervical_circlage_techniques_and_indications | Cervical cerclage]] involves placing a suture around the cervix to keep it closed. It can be performed in pregnant or non-pregnant females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A non-absorbable monofilament suture is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Types of Cerclage:

#### Transvaginal Cerclage
*   **McDonald Cerclage**: The most commonly performed cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. It involves applying a purse-string suture on the porio vaginalis (the part of the cervix inside the vagina), as close as possible to the internal os <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Shirodkar Cerclage**: Another transvaginal technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Wurm Cerclage**: Used as an emergency or rescue cerclage when the cervix is already dilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It involves two stitches placed anteriorly and posteriorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Prognosis is typically poor in these emergency cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Transabdominal Cerclage
*   Also known as Benson and Deery cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   Can be done laparoscopically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> and in both pregnant and non-pregnant females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Indications**: Failed transvaginal cerclage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Drawbacks**: It is an abdominal surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The sutures are not removed until the family is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, and future pregnancies require delivery by Cesarean section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

#### Lash and Lash Procedure (Historical)
*   Performed vaginally in non-pregnant females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Involved removing a defective part of the cervix and then stitching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   This procedure made the cervix very fragile, necessitating a 3-month gap before conception and delivery by Cesarean section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   It is largely not performed anymore due to complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. In non-pregnant females today, laparoscopic cerclage is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Timing of Cerclage
The optimal time for performing cerclage is between 14 to 16 weeks of gestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. It can be done as early as 12 weeks and as late as 24 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

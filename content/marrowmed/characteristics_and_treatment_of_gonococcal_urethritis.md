Gonococcal urethritis is an infection primarily caused by the bacterium *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

## Clinical Features

Patients presenting with gonococcal urethritis typically report:
*   Pain during micturition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>
*   Itching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>
*   Dysuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>
*   Purulent urethral discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>

The infection is often associated with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Diagnosis

### Microscopy
Gram stain of urethral discharge shows characteristic Gram-negative intracellular cocci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. These organisms are often described as kidney-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### Culture
*   **Selective Medium:** For isolation, Thayer-Martin agar is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. This medium is selective for *Neisseria* species and contains three antibiotics: vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Nutritional Requirements:** *Neisseria* requires an enriched medium to grow, differentiating it from Gram-negative organisms that grow on MacConkey agar without special nutritional requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## Treatment

The most appropriate [[Antimicrobial treatments | treatment]] for gonococcal urethritis includes:
*   Intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>
*   Oral cefixime 400 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>

> [!NOTE|Symptoms vs. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria]
> This condition falls under [[Sexually Transmitted Infections and Urethritis | sexually transmitted infections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. For general urinary tract infections (UTIs) in symptomatic females, a count of ≥10^2 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per ml in a clean catch midstream urine sample is considered significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. This is distinct from the higher count (≥10^5 CFU/ml) criteria typically used for asymptomatic bacteriuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

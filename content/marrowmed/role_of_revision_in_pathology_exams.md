Success in medical entrance examinations like the INI-CET and NEET PG largely depends on consistent and thorough revision of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This holds particularly true for Pathology, a core subject that connects various medical fields like medicine, surgery, and gynaecology <a class="yt-0timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Importance of Revision

The difficulty level of exams such as the November 2024 INI-CET, which featured approximately 20-25 Pathology questions, is often described as moderate to severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The ability to navigate this difficulty depends on how many times a candidate has [[importance_of_consistent_revision_for_medical_exams | revised]] the subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Many questions, especially factual ones, can only be answered correctly if the subject has been [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revised]] thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. For instance, questions on [[common_topics_in_pathology_exams | common topics in pathology exams]] like specific genetic mutations (e.g., sickle cell anemia) or components of syndromes (e.g., MEN2B, NAME complex) require precise recall gained through repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Revision Strategy

For medical exams, it's advised to:
*   **Do topics thoroughly**: It is crucial to study [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | topics]] in great detail, as many questions often repeat topics from previous INI-CET and NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on a single source**: Concentrate on one primary study source and [[importance_of_revision_for_neetpg_and_ini_exams | repeatedly revise]] from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
*   **Multiple revisions**: A single reading or one [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | revision]] is generally insufficient to clear MCQ exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.
*   **Practice**: [[importance_of_revision_and_grand_tests | Revision]] in subjects like Hematology allows students to master how to approach and solve different types of leukemia questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

> Continuous and effective revision is the **key** to clearing medical MCQ exams, leading to a potentially high strike rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

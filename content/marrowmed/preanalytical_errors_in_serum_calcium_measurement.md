Measuring serum [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] is highly susceptible to various preanalytical errors, making careful blood sample collection essential for accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Even minor changes during the collection process can lead to an increase in total blood [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

## In Vivo Preanalytical Errors

These errors occur before the blood is drawn and can significantly impact [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] measurement:

*   **Tourniquet Use and Venous Occlusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>
    *   Prolonged tourniquet use or venous occlusion can cause venous stasis, leading to water being expelled from the vascular compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
    *   This expulsion of water increases the concentration of protein-bound [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
    *   Ideally, a tourniquet should be tied just before taking the sample and released immediately, with a maximum time of 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Changes in Posture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>
    *   Standing, for instance, can increase [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Exercise and Fist Clenching** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>
    *   Both exercise and fist clenching increase lactic acid, leading to acidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
    *   Acidosis, in turn, increases the protein-bound [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Immobilization and Bed Rest** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>
    *   Long periods of immobilization can lead to osteoporosis, which increases [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   **Hyperventilation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>
    *   Hyperventilation can also increase [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

## In Vitro Preanalytical Errors

These errors relate to the collection tube and subsequent handling of the blood sample:

*   **Anticoagulant Choice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>
    *   The correct anticoagulant must be chosen for accurate [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium estimation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
    *   Heparin is the recommended anticoagulant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
        *   Liquid heparin should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
        *   Lyophilized heparin is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.
    *   Anticoagulants such as EDTA, citrate, and oxalate should be avoided because they chelate [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

::info
To measure serum [[calcium_metabolism_and_its_significance_in_exams | calcium]] accurately, measures such as preventing prolonged tourniquet use, avoiding collection after exercise or with fist clenching, and using appropriate anticoagulants (like lyophilized heparin instead of citrate-containing vacutainers) are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. All these factors contribute to potential preanalytical errors and should be prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

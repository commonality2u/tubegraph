The INSS (presumably INICET) November 2024 recall questions for [[community_medicine_in_neetpg | Community Medicine]] highlight shifting exam patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The session's primary objective is to discuss important questions and the overall pattern observed in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Overall Exam Nature
The INSS exam is described as "predictably unpredictable," meaning the emphasis on specific topics can change from year to year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While the exam questions themselves were direct this year, similar to the May 2024 exam, candidates are advised to keep their guards up and prepare thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. The paper was generally considered "easy to moderate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, or "super duper easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a> for November 2024.

## Shifting Topic Focus
Historically, INSS exams in [[community_medicine_in_neetpg | Community Medicine]] were known to ask questions heavily from topics like regression analysis, correlations, and Kappa stats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

However, the November 2024 exam showed a significant shift:
*   More questions were asked from **Public Health** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Increased focus on **National Health Programs** and **Preventive Medicine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Specific examples include prevention of Zika, COVID-19, malaria diagnosis and treatment, water-based diseases, and HIV prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Distribution of Questions
The November 2024 paper was described as "balanced" in its distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, with approximately two to three questions from each of the following areas:
*   Epidemiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   Biomedical Waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Health Planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Exercise Physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Mother and Child Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

## Source Material and Beyond Textbooks
While the "Park textbook" is often cited as a primary resource, the exam included questions that were not directly from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This emphasizes the need to refer to additional guidelines and recent updates. For example:
*   Questions on malaria detection in the field were based on new guidelines from the National Vector-Borne Disease Control program's strategic action plan for malaria elimination (2023-2027), rather than the Park textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   A question on ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) was not found in the Park textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   Vaccine recommendations for adults (e.g., HPV vaccine) align with CDC guidelines adopted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

This highlights the importance of comprehensive [[strategies_for_preparing_for_competitive_medical_exams | preparation strategies]] that go beyond single textbooks, incorporating recent guidelines and updates for [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | medical entrance exam preparation strategies]].

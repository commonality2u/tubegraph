Dr. Akshhat Koshik, who secured Rank 8 in INI-CET May 2025, adopted a unique approach to his Post Graduate (PG) exam preparation, emphasizing [[the_importance_of_starting_early_in_medical_exam_preparation | starting early]] and building a strong clinical foundation rather than focusing solely on exam strategies from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. His primary aim was to become a good doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Dr. Akshhat's Early Preparation Journey

Unlike many who start with the PG exam as their immediate goal, Dr. Akshhat's initial focus was on balancing his life and optimizing his clinical knowledge throughout his MBBS degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. He observed that many people took undue stress and started intensive preparation strategies too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

*   **Early Adoption of Resources:** He began using Maro plans from his second year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Low-Pressure Learning:** He put almost zero pressure on himself, watching only one to three videos per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This allowed him time to absorb the knowledge from videos, college, and patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Foundation Building:** This "low energy task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> of building a clinical base using Maro videos and actual clinical postings was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He completed all Maro videos and hard copy notes once by his final year/internship, without engaging in question banks or other intensive preparations during that phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Integration:** Videos significantly aided his understanding during clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. For instance, his early study of cardiology, including concepts like Frank-Starling law and different pulse types, proved invaluable, allowing him to answer related questions in the final INI-CET exam without recent revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This deep, early learning meant he didn't need to read these topics in the last six months or from Previous Year Questions (PQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Starting Early

Starting early provides several key advantages:

*   **Deeper Understanding:** It allows ample time to delve into every detail and word, fostering a comprehensive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Ingrained Knowledge:** Important basic concepts become deeply ingrained, eliminating the need for constant revision as they become second nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Stress and Underconfidence:** This approach helps in reducing underconfidence and the internal "battle with oneself" during the preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Process over Outcome:** It enables aspirants to focus on the learning process rather than being overly attached to a specific rank or number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Application:** Knowledge gained early integrates naturally with clinical practice during internship, making it a "clinical revision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>. Dr. Akshhat found that real-life diagnoses, like hypothyroidism or Kawasaki disease, solidified his understanding far more effectively than theoretical study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

## Internship and Final Preparation

During his internship, Dr. Akshhat largely disengaged from active exam preparation, focusing on clinical duties and taking breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. He credits his clear concepts from earlier years for his confidence, giving only one Grand Test (GT) in 11 months of internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

His intensive preparation, described as "going all in," began only in the last four to five months before the exam, from January to May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This final phase was characterized by a [[timeline_for_exam_preparation | targeted, consistent approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>, primarily focusing on:
*   Previous Year Questions (PQs) from both NEET PG and INI-CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
*   Custom modules of questions for regular testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.
*   Giving and thoroughly reviewing 8-9 GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.
*   Sticking to revision videos for quick review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

## Advice for Juniors

Dr. Akshhat advises juniors to:

*   **Own their journey:** The path to success is personal, and there's no single "correct way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Find their balance:** Half the journey is finding the perfect optimized balance and situation to perform at one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace knowledge and practice:** True learning involves acquiring deep knowledge and applying it in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. Once knowledge is learned to its depth, it cannot be taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.
*   **Enjoy the journey:** Starting early allows students to enjoy their preparation journey without feeling overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

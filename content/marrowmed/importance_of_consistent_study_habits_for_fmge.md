Dr. Manoj Goa, who achieved an "unbelievable" score of 256 on his first attempt at the FMGE exam on January 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, emphasizes that such a score cannot be achieved through short-term study alone, but rather through consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. His [[dr_fatimas_study_strategy_for_fmge_using_marrow_plan_c | study strategy]] highlights the significance of long-term, structured [[importance_of_consistent_and_structured_study_plan | study plan]] and [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | consistency]] in preparation.

## Early Preparation and Resource Utilization

Dr. Manoj began his [[preparation_strategies_for_fmge | preparation]] early, subscribing to Marrow's two-year Plan C in his third year of MBBS, acquiring printed notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This early start allowed him to integrate dedicated [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | exam preparation]] with his college curriculum.

## Structured Study Approach

His [[effective_fmge_preparation_strategies | approach]] was methodical:
*   **During MBBS (3rd and 4th year)**: He focused on completing third-year subjects (ENT, Ophthalmology, Community Medicine) and final-year subjects (OBGY, Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics). For each subject, he watched all Marrow videos, read printed notes, practiced MCQs from the QBank, and solved the last 10 years of NEET PG, INICET, and FMGE previous year questions (PYQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. He particularly dedicated significant time to Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Upon returning to India (last six months)**: He then dedicated himself to the first and second-year pre-clinical and para-clinical subjects, spending about two and a half months on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Short Subjects**: For subjects like Skin, Anesthesia, Radiology, and Psychiatry, he relied exclusively on Marrow's revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, emphasizing the need to read "each and every word" from these notes for effective retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Revision Strategy

Dr. Manoj completed three full revisions before the final exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. For major subjects like Surgery, OBGY, and Community Medicine, he used his main notes and annotated new points onto his revision notes. For other subjects, he focused solely on the revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Importance of Grand Tests (GTs)

He started giving GTs early, his first one on August 1st, scoring 231 after only completing Microbiology and Pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. His strategy for reviewing GTs involved going through every question, regardless of whether he got it right or wrong, to understand explanations and alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He spread out the review process, analyzing 30-40 questions per day over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Dr. Manoj's national mock test score of 259 was very close to his actual FMGE score, confirming the quality of Marrow's tests as a reflection of the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Advice for Future Aspirants

Dr. Manoj offers valuable [[advice_for_future_fmge_exam_takers | advice]] for different groups of students:

### For University Students
*   Focus on completing third and final-year subjects thoroughly during your undergraduate years, including watching videos, reading notes, and solving MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   This approach ensures that upon returning to India, you only need to concentrate on first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   [[strategies_for_preparing_for_fmge_and_inicet_exams | Consistency]] and conceptual understanding are key. The FMGE is evolving, with more conceptual and tricky questions, making rote learning ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Concepts are built by working through study material from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### For All Students
*   **Focus on Passing First**: Prioritize scoring the passing marks (150) before aiming for higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Weak Areas**: Identify and strengthen your weaker subjects before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Stick to One Source**: Avoid chasing too much information or switching between multiple platforms. Stick to one reliable source and trust it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Dr. Manoj attributes his success to relying solely on Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Confidence**: Maintain confidence in your preparation. Dr. Manoj was confident he would score above 200, even if he studied for only a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Consistency, a structured plan, thorough revision, and strategic test-taking are critical pillars for success in the FMGE.

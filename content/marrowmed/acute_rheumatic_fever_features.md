Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a condition that can be diagnosed based on a combination of clinical manifestations, particularly joint and cardiac involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
An adolescent presenting with ARF may exhibit:
*   Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   Purpura on the thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>
*   Swelling of multiple joints, such as the right knee and left ankle (indicating arthritis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Abnormal diastolic murmur in the cardiac apical area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

It is noted that patients are sero-negative for rheumatoid factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, distinguishing it from other conditions like [[Psoriasis and Seronegative Arthropathy | Seronegative Arthropathy]] or rheumatoid arthritis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Diagnosis (Jones Criteria)
The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is typically made using the Jones criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This involves:
*   Two major criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, OR
*   One major criterion plus two minor criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, OR
*   In cases of recurrence, even three minor criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Major Criteria
*   **Arthritis**: Involvement of multiple joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Carditis**: Cardiac involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Minor Criteria
*   Fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Cardiac Involvement
Cardiac involvement in acute rheumatic fever often manifests as valvulitis, which can lead to specific heart murmurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. A classical diastolic murmur associated with mitral valvulitis in ARF is known as the Carry-Coombs murmur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

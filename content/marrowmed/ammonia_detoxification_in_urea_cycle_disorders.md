The human body meticulously handles ammonia, a toxic byproduct of amino acid catabolism, to prevent its accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. In a healthy state, ammonia is not freely discarded but is concentrated into a non-toxic form known as glutamate through a process called transamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Normal Ammonia Handling
Glutamate, carrying the amino group, is then transported to the liver primarily as glutamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. In the liver, glutamine is converted back to glutamate, releasing ammonia which then enters the urea cycle for detoxification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Additionally, glutamate can be converted to alpha-ketoglutarate by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, releasing another molecule of ammonia into the urea cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This careful handling ensures ammonia is detoxified in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Urea Cycle Disorders and Treatment
In cases of urea cycle disorders, the body's ability to detoxify ammonia is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. To manage this, a therapeutic approach known as ascylation therapy is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This therapy aims to scavenge excess ammonia by facilitating its excretion. This topic relates to [[Metabolic disorders and enzymes]].

### Phenylbutyrate Therapy
One key treatment involves the administration of phenylbutyrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Phenylbutyrate acts as a prodrug, metabolizing into phenylacetate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Phenylacetate then combines with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, which is subsequently excreted in the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This process effectively scavenges ammonia from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Amino Acid Involvement**: Although glutamine directly combines with phenylacetate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, glutamate can also be considered a contributing amino acid because glutamine is formed from glutamate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Sodium Benzoate Therapy
Another ascylation therapy uses sodium benzoate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Sodium benzoate combines with glycine to form benzoylglycine, also known as hippuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This hippuric acid is then excreted in the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Ammonia Scavenging**: By combining with glycine, sodium benzoate forces the body to synthesize more glycine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Glycine is synthesized from ammonia, carbon dioxide, and a one-carbon group donated by tetrahydrofolic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Thus, the increased demand for glycine consumes excess ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

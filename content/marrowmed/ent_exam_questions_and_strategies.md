## Recalled ENT Questions and Discussion

### 1. CSOM and Tetanus Association

**Question:** A four-year-old child presents with difficulty opening the mouth and tonic spasms of the limbs. The child gives a history of CSOM. Most likely diagnosis is? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

**Key Keywords:**
*   Difficulty opening mouth (Trismus or Lockjaw) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Tonic spasms of limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   History of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

**Discussion of Choices:**
*   **Tetanus:** Tetanus commonly presents with trismus and lockjaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and tonic spasms of the limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. *Clostridium tetani* can gain access to the body through any open wound, including a perforated tympanic membrane in CSOM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The discharging ear in CSOM provides a suitable anaerobic environment for the bacteria's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is known as otogenic tetanus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Meningitis:** Typical presentation includes headache, fever, and neck rigidity, but never trismus or lockjaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. While meningitis can be a complication of CSOM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, this specific presentation is inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Bezold's Abscess:** This is a complication of acute mastoiditis where mastoid abscess tracks down the sternocleidomastoid muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Patients experience ear discharge, pain, and swelling in the neck, but not trismus or tonic spasms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Sagittal/Sigmoid Sinus Thrombosis:** Patients typically have high fever and headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Neck pain may occur if the thrombus extends to the jugular vein, but trismus and tonic spasms are not seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

**Answer:** Tetanus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### 2. Indications for Cochlear Implant

**Question:** Which of the following are indications of cochlear implant? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

**Indications for Cochlear Implant:** Cochlear implants are indicated for severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. They replace the function of the organ of Corti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Congenital Hearing Loss (Prelingual):** Yes, if it is severe to profound sensorineural loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Post-lingual Hearing Loss:** This includes cases following meningitis (labyrinthitis), ototoxicity, presbycusis, or sudden sensorineural hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Otosclerosis:** This causes conductive hearing loss, typically managed by stapedectomy, not cochlear implant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. However, cochlear otosclerosis, if leading to severe sensorineural hearing loss, could be an indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Aminoglycoside-induced Profound Hearing Loss:** Yes, as aminoglycosides damage the organ of Corti, leading to sensorineural hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Congenital Malleus Fixation:** This causes conductive hearing loss, managed by ossiculoplasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

**Answer:** Congenital Hearing Loss and Aminoglycoside-induced Profound Hearing Loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### 3. Rotational Vertigo Diagnosis

**Question:** A 52-year-old male presents with vomiting and complaints of rotational vertigo upon turning in bed in the morning. What is the most likely diagnosis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>

**Key Features:**
*   Vertigo on posture change (specifically "upon turning in bed in the morning") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>
*   Vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>

**Discussion of Choices:**
*   **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV):** This condition is characterized by episodic vertigo triggered by specific head movements or posture changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Vomiting can occur in any severe vertigo, whether peripheral or central, due to vestibular system interconnections with the autonomic nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Meniere's Disease:** Vertigo in Meniere's is typically continuous, lasting from 20 minutes to 24 hours, not specifically triggered by posture change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Vestibular Neuritis:** This involves inflammation of the vestibular nerve, causing continuous severe vertigo lasting several days, not positional vertigo <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Vomiting is common due to severe vertigo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Labyrinthitis:** Inflammation of the labyrinth causes continuous vertigo for a few days to weeks, not positional vertigo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Vomiting can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

**Answer:** BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### 4. Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)

**Question:** Not true about Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>

**Characteristics of JNA:**
*   **Exclusively seen in adolescent males:** This is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Causes recurrent epistaxis:** This is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Causes unilateral nasal obstruction:** JNA arises from the sphenopalatine foramen, located posteriorly in the lateral wall of the nose, leading to unilateral obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Biopsy under local anesthesia is done:** This is **not true**. Angiofibroma consists only of blood vessels and fibrous tissue with no muscular coat, making biopsy contraindicated due to severe bleeding risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The best investigation for diagnosis is CCT V-sign, Homan Miller sign, and Andreal sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

**Answer:** Biopsy under local anesthesia is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### 5. Nerve Not Involved with Olfaction

**Question:** Which of the following nerves is not involved with olfaction? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>

**Discussion of Choices:**
*   **Hypoglossal Nerve (XII):** This is a purely motor nerve, supplying the tongue muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Therefore, it is not involved with olfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Facial Nerve (VII), Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX), Vagus Nerve (X):** These nerves are involved in taste (anterior 2/3 of tongue by VII, posterior 1/3 by IX, posterior-most by X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Taste, along with smell (olfactory mucosa) and somatosensory input (e.g., texture, hot/cold, irritation via Trigeminal nerve), contributes to the "flavor" of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Thus, indirectly, these nerves contribute to the perception associated with eating, which is closely linked to olfaction.
*   **Trigeminal Nerve (V):** (Mentioned as a possible choice by some students) The trigeminal nerve provides general sensation and detects irritants, hot/cold, and texture in the nasal and oral cavities, contributing to the overall "flavor" perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

**Answer:** Hypoglossal Nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### 6. Nerve Responsible for Irritation in Pyriform Fossa

**Question:** A middle-aged lady choked while eating fish and has associated symptoms of coughing and foreign body sensations in the throat. On examination, the fish bone was lodged in the pyriform fossa. Which nerve is responsible for the irritation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>

**Discussion of Choices:**
*   **Internal Branch of Superior Laryngeal Nerve:** This nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane and supplies sensory innervation to the larynx and hypopharynx above the level of the true vocal cords, including the pyriform fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. It lies superficially in the pyriform fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **External Branch of Superior Laryngeal Nerve:** This is primarily a motor nerve, supplying the cricothyroid muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Glossopharyngeal Nerve:** Supplies sensation to the oropharynx, but not the hypopharynx or pyriform fossa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve:** Provides sensory innervation to the larynx and hypopharynx below the level of the true vocal cords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

**Answer:** Internal Laryngeal Nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### 7. Causes of Stridor in Neonates

**Question:** Which of the following are the causes of stridor in neonates? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>

**Discussion of Choices:**
*   **Laryngomalacia:** Yes, this is the most common cause of stridor in newborns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. It presents with inspiratory stridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **Subglottic Stenosis:** Yes, this is the third most common cause of stridor in newborns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. It typically causes biphasic stridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   **Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis):** This is acquired at birth (e.g., via vaginal delivery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. It typically first presents with hoarseness months or years after birth, and stridor only occurs later when the papillomas become exuberant and block the larynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Thus, it is not typically present in neonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Hemorrhagic Polyp:** No, a single polyp does not typically cause stridor, especially not in neonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

**Answer:** Laryngomalacia and Subglottic Stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

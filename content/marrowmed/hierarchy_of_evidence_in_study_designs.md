The pattern of questions in the November 2024 INI-CET exam was described as "predictably unpredictable," meaning the specific topics that would be emphasized were unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While typically, [[Statistical tests and analysis in biostatistics | statistical tests and analysis]] topics like regression analysis and correlations were common, this year saw more questions from public health, national health programs, and preventive medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Questions were also observed from [[Biostatistics and Epidemiology Concepts | epidemiology]], vaccines, biomedical waste, health planning, exercise physiology, and mother and child health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Best Study Design as Per Hierarchy of Evidence

When considering the hierarchy of evidence, the best study design for assessing the level of evidence is consistently [[structure_and_sequence_of_research_studies_in_epidemiology | meta-analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This hierarchy is often visualized as a pyramid or diagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Levels of Evidence

*   **Lowest Level**: At the foundational or lowest level of the hierarchy are case series, case reports, editorials, and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Analytical Studies**: Above the lowest level are analytical studies, which include case-control studies and cohort studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Top of the Chart**: At the pinnacle of the hierarchy are randomized trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, which form the basis of evidence-based medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The singular best answer for the top study design is meta-analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

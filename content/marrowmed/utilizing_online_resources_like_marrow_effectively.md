Dr. Tupi, who secured Rank 1 in the INI CET exam, shares her strategic approach to utilizing online educational resources, particularly the [[use_and_benefits_of_educational_platforms_like_marrow | Marrow platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Her journey from a NEET PG rank of 19,000 to first rank in INI CET highlights the effectiveness of a structured study plan and the diligent [[utilizing_educational_apps_like_marrow_for_medical_studies | utilization of Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Early Engagement with Marrow
Dr. Tupi became a Plan C subscriber of [[marrow_as_a_primary_study_resource | Marrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> since her third year of medical studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. She primarily relied on the [[use_of_marrow_videos_for_medical_education | Marrow notes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, supplementing them with additional points she deemed important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Integrating Marrow with Textbooks
During her fourth year, she utilized [[marrow_video_lectures and their effectiveness | Marrow video lectures]] to gain clarity on subjects and supplemented them with traditional textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For medicine, she watched Dr. Rakesh's videos for conceptual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. She stressed the importance of reading standard Indian textbooks, such as SRB for Surgery and Ramdas Nayak for Medicine, rather than relying solely on "fancy" authors or shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Strategic Use of Grand Tests (GTs) and Question Banks
Dr. Tupi began taking [[strategies_for_using_marrow_grand_tests_effectively | Marrow Grand Tests]] and solving questions from the [[effective_use_of_qbank_and_marrow_resources | QBank]] after her internship concluded, as she didn't have time during her heavy internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Grand Test Frequency and Review
*   **Initial Phase:** For the first few months post-internship, she took GTs once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Increased Frequency:** As her knowledge improved, she increased the frequency to once every 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, eventually moving to once a week in the final months before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Improving Scores:** To combat plateauing scores, she created a "GT book" in the last two to three months of her preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This small notebook contained mistakes from topics she had already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, which she regularly revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Same-Day Review:** She made it a point to review the GT on the same day it was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. She would start reviewing from her weakest subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, quickly going through correct answers and reading incorrect ones in detail to add to her notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Question Bank Utilization
*   **Daily Volume:** Initially, she solved 50 questions per day during her first revision phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, increasing to 100 questions per day later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Custom Modules:** She regularly used custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   **Tags:** She first completed all previous year questions (PYQs) modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. After that, she focused on custom modules using tags like NEET, AIIMS, clinical questions, and image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
    *   **Difficulty:** She selected all difficulty levels for her custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   **Target Scores:** She did not set target correct scores for custom modules, acknowledging that new questions could be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
    *   **Bookmarking:** She bookmarked questions she got wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a> but mainly revisited them by using the # hashtag in the last few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Revision Strategy
Her revision strategy involved:
*   Revising through her [[utilization_of_educational_resources_like_marrow_videos_and_q_bank | Marrow notes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   In the last 20 days before the exam, she covered all subjects once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   In the final five days, she quickly reviewed only the highlighted points in her notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, ensuring a visual impression of all subjects to refresh her memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Mindset and Motivation
A significant turning point was accepting her NEET rank and realizing she could improve if she covered all subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Her November INI CET rank of 115 served as a major confidence booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. She highlights the importance of parental support in pursuing another attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> and the fact that she wasn't fatigued, which allowed her to push for the May exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. She advises students to accept their results faster to perform better in the next attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Advice for Undergraduates

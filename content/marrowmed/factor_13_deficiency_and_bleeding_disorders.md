Factor 13 deficiency is a rare inherited [[Enzyme deficiencies and their biochemical implications | clotting factor disorder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Overview
Factor 13, also known as fibrin stabilizing factor or clot stabilizing factor, plays a crucial role after the initial formation of a clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Its primary function is the crosslinking of fibrin to stabilize the clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Clinical Presentation
Individuals with Factor 13 deficiency typically present with repeated bleeding manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Common bleeding sites include:
*   Umbilical bleeding since birth, especially in an infant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   Epistaxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   Recurrent rectal bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   Soft tissue bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
*   Surgical bleeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
*   Joint bleeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Potentially dangerous intracranial bleeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

## Diagnosis
The diagnosis of Factor 13 deficiency relies on specific coagulation testing:
*   **Routine Coagulation Tests**: Prothrombin Time (PT), Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), Thrombin Time, platelet count, and platelet function are typically normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This is because these tests reflect coagulation up to the formation of fibrin, which is unaffected in Factor 13 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. They do not measure the crosslinking or stabilization of the clot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Urea Clot Solubility Test**: This specific test is used to identify affected individuals and will turn out positive in Factor 13 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Treatment
The treatment for Factor 13 deficiency involves the replacement of Factor 13, typically administered in the form of Factor 13 concentrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Dr. Akhil Tambi, who secured All India Rank 6 in the November INI CET 2024, shares his comprehensive approach to medical exam preparation, emphasizing the effective utilization of test resources like [[Marrow for medical exam preparation | Marrow]]'s custom modules and grand tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Start and Foundation Building
Dr. Akhil began his [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | journey with Marrow]] in his third year of MBBS, following the advice of his seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The initial focus was on preparing for the NEET PG examination, shifting from being merely "prof-oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

He recommends starting preparation from the fifth semester (end of second year) to strengthen foundational subjects like Pathology, Pharmacology, and Microbiology, which are crucial throughout MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. His approach involved:
*   Watching video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Making notes for some subjects (e.g., ENT, Ophthalmology) and using printed notes for larger subjects like Obstetrics, Gynaecology, and Surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Immediately solving questions from the [[Utilizing Question Banks for Competitive Medical Exams | question bank]] related to the topic covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Dr. Akhil prioritized major subjects like Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, and Gynaecology from the end of the third year, as their concepts are interrelated and crucial for overall understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He advised spending minimal time on short subjects, focusing primarily on their previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Utilizing Test Resources Effectively

### Grand Tests (GTs)
Dr. Akhil started giving [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. His strategy for reviewing GTs was to primarily focus on incorrect answers to avoid repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. He identified weak topics from the mistakes or previous year questions and referred back to his notes for those specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

He highlights the importance of consistency in taking tests, whether it's [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] or subject-wise tests, as this ultimately determines one's rank on the exam day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. GTs also serve as a method for self-revision of all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

### [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | Custom Modules]]
Dr. Akhil regards [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | Marrow's custom modules]] as its "best feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> and the "ultimate feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. He used them for:
*   **Flexibility**: Allows customization of preparation according to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Targeted Practice**: After reading a specific topic, he would create a [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | custom module]] for that topic, incorporating previous year NEET and AIIMS questions, and clinical questions with images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Identifying Weaknesses**: If more than half the questions in a [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | custom module]] were incorrect, it indicated a need to revisit notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. However, if over 75% were correct, he wouldn't re-read the entire topic, saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### Bookmark Feature - A Cautionary Tale
While useful, Dr. Akhil extensively used the bookmark feature and later "regretted it" due to an overwhelming number of bookmarks (around 900) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. He advises juniors:
*   **Avoid over-bookmarking**: Don't bookmark in the first read, as everything might seem important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Selective Bookmarking**: Bookmark selectively after the first read, focusing only on truly important concepts or weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Alternative for PYQs**: He maintained a separate notebook for previous year questions he answered incorrectly, as it was more manageable than revising numerous bookmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Revision Strategy and Mindset
Dr. Akhil stresses the importance of efficient revision:
*   **Main Notes vs. Revision Notes**: Main notes are crucial for building concepts and performing well in professional exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Revision notes/videos, which condense important, high-yield, and previously asked topics, are vital for efficient last-minute revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Consistency in Faculty**: Sticking to the same faculty for both main and revision videos ensures synchronicity and prevents confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
*   **Selective Reading**: After the first read, become selective, focusing on important topics and those you struggled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Highlighting mistakes in notes helps in quick revision of weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

### Final Advice: A Systematic Approach
Dr. Akhil likens competitive exam preparation to a "system of traces" in surgery â€“ categorizing topics as red (weak), yellow (moderate), and green (strong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. His recommended systematic progression is:
1.  **First Read (Topic-wise)**: Read notes and solve questions topic by topic, focusing on previous year questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Highlight mistakes in notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
2.  **Second Revision (Subject-wise)**: Work through subject-wise previous year question banks and [[Utilizing custom modules for exam preparation | custom modules]] for subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
3.  **Final Cycle (Full Syllabus)**: Engage in full-fledged [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] covering all 19 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

He emphasizes that efforts never go to waste and one must "have that firm belief that my efforts will be successful one day or the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Being selective and mastering previous year topics are key to success in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

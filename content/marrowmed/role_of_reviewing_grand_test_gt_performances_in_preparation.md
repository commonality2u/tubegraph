Dr. Vinit, who achieved an excellent rank of seven in the INI CET exam, emphasizes the critical role of [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests (GTs)]] and their subsequent review in his preparation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Success, as noted, occurs when preparation meets opportunity, and being well-prepared is key to seizing such opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Starting Grand Tests

Dr. Vinit began regularly taking [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | Grand Tests]] a few months into his internship, specifically around June of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He did not wait for an "ideal time" to start, nor had he completed his entire subject reading before beginning GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. At that point, minor subjects were still left, and he hadn't extensively revised first and second-year topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

He established a routine of taking one GT every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Initially, his ranks in these weekly exams ranged from 40 to 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, though he later clarified that by the end, he was consistently in the top 20, and even in the top 10 a couple of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This demonstrates significant [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | improvement in GT scores over time]] through consistent effort.

## The Grand Test Review Process

Dr. Vinit's strategy was not just to take GTs, but to engage in a thorough review of each test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This process was crucial for his [[effective_utilization_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | preparation]].

### Dedicated Review Time
After completing a GT, he dedicated a substantial portion of the rest of the week to reviewing the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. He would start the review process the next day, analyzing about 50 questions daily, which could take up to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Comprehensive Explanation Analysis
Unlike many who only review incorrect answers, Dr. Vinit went through the explanations for *every* question, whether he got it right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. He read "the entire explanation" for each question, emphasizing that while questions might not repeat, the topics are "very high yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Identifying and Strengthening Topics
Reviewing GTs helped him identify high-yield topics. For instance, if a question about a parasite's egg appeared, he would then read up on all related parasites and create flashcards for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This proactive approach allowed him to learn and reinforce concepts even for subjects he hadn't fully covered before taking the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Leveraging GTs for Weakness Identification
The review process allowed him to realize where he had gone wrong and then work more on his weaknesses, turning them into strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This is a core aspect of [[utilizing_gt_analytics_for_exam_preparation | using GT analytics for exam preparation]].

### Developing a Strategic Mindset
When solving questions, especially tricky ones, Dr. Vinit emphasized the importance of understanding the concepts. His preparation helped him develop the "knack" to crack these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He advises others to "figure out why the wrong answer is wrong" even if they don't immediately know the right one, as each option often provides a hint related to a specific disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This strategy of elimination based on conceptual understanding is crucial.

## Impact on Overall Preparation

Grand Tests played a significant role in Dr. Vinit's overall preparation:
*   **Coverage of Uncovered Subjects**: GTs helped him gain exposure to subjects he hadn't fully studied, by enabling him to review the comprehensive explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Conceptual Clarity**: He found that going through videos and GT explanations helped solidify concepts, which was vital for tackling tricky questions in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This year's INI CET, in particular, focused less on factual recall and more on conceptual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Competitive Edge**: Dr. Vinit believes that Maro's question bank and [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | Grand Tests]] are "hands down... the best in the business," attributing his competitive edge to their "topnotch" explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Conclusion

Dr. Vinit's journey underscores that taking Grand Tests is only half the battle; the meticulous and comprehensive review of performance, including going through every explanation to identify high-yield topics and understand underlying concepts, is equally important for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This approach fosters continuous learning and strategic thinking, essential for competitive medical exams.

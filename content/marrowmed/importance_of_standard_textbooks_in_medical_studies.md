Dr. NR, who secured Rank 1 in the INI CET exam, significantly relied on standard textbooks throughout his medical studies and preparation [00:00:16]. His approach offers valuable insights into the effective use of these foundational resources.

## A Textbook-Centric Approach
Dr. NR's preparation was heavily rooted in standard textbooks, a rarity in modern medical education [00:00:16, 00:11:56]. He considered these books his primary theory source [00:06:11]. This reliance on textbooks provided him with [[importance_of_foundational_knowledge_in_medicine | foundational knowledge]] [00:02:43].

During his undergraduate days, he consistently used standard textbooks for his [[importance_of_exams_for_medical_students | Prof exams]] [00:14:41]. Specific textbooks he mentioned reading include Gong's and Robins [00:12:37, 00:12:42]. He also read "concise them" [00:12:42].

### Note-Taking and Revision Techniques
Rather than creating extensive handwritten [[importance_of_notetaking_and_revision_techniques_in_medical_studies | notes]] from scratch, Dr. NR primarily underlined key information directly in his textbooks [00:13:13]. He maintained a separate notebook for extra information gathered from sources like the library or the Marrow app, which he would then write down [00:13:18, 00:13:26, 00:13:29]. For revision, he would focus on these underlined portions [00:13:06, 00:13:39].

His father, a lawyer who read extensively, unintentionally inspired this habit of in-depth reading [00:13:42, 00:13:48, 00:14:04].

## Supplementing Textbooks with Recent Updates
While standard textbooks provide comprehensive information, Dr. NR acknowledged that they might not always contain the latest updates due to their publication cycle (editions typically come out every third or fourth year) [00:07:00, 00:07:03]. To address this, he supplemented his textbook knowledge:
*   He used the Marrow QBank, which often incorporated recent updates [00:07:06, 00:07:33, 00:07:40].
*   He also followed internet resources and Dr. Rohan Kelal's Telegram channel for updates [00:08:06, 00:08:09, 00:08:12].

## Maintaining Conviction Amidst Different Approaches
Dr. NR was an "aberration in the batch" for solely relying on standard textbooks when many peers were using different methods [00:14:53, 00:15:53]. Despite this, he remained focused by trusting his method [00:15:00]. He believed that because his college professors prepared their [[role_of_video_lectures_in_medical_education | lectures]] and exam questions from these very textbooks, his chosen path was valid and on the right track [00:15:06, 00:15:16, 00:15:27, 00:15:29].

His experience highlights the importance of having conviction in one's chosen study path, even if it differs from the norm [00:15:48, 00:15:50, 00:15:56].

## Advice for Students
Dr. NR strongly recommends that [[effective_study_strategies_for_firstyear_mbbs_students | First Years]], [[effective_study_strategies_for_firstyear_mbbs_students | second years]], and third years "follow the standard textbooks" [00:25:04, 00:25:08, 00:25:12]. He believes that as aspiring doctors, students should justify their reputation as "the most studious people" by engaging with these fundamental resources [00:25:20, 00:25:23]. He also advises sincerely attending clinical postings, as there is significant learning beyond textbooks [00:25:43, 00:25:45, 00:25:48].

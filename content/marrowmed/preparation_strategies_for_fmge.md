Dr. Kriti Singh successfully cleared the FMGE exam in January 2025 with an impressive score of 248 out of 300 in her very first attempt, after graduating from Caucasus University, Georgia in July 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>. Her detailed [[preparation_strategy_for_medical_entrance_exams | preparation strategy for medical entrance exams]] offers valuable insights for aspiring medical graduates.

## Marrow as the Primary Study Resource

Dr. Kriti Singh utilized Marrow as her primary source of [[medical_entrance_exam_preparation_strategies | medical entrance exam preparation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>. She subscribed to Marrow in 2021 during her fourth year of university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### Initial Study Approach
She began her studies with foundational subjects like Pathology, aiming to build concepts from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>. Despite a demanding university schedule filled with classes, postings, and assignments, she managed to consistently watch Marrow videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) were specifically dedicated to academic productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:07">[03:45:07]</a>. During weekdays, she aimed to watch two to three videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:02">[04:14:02]</a>.

### Note-Taking and QBank Strategy
Initially, Dr. Singh created handwritten notes, including over a thousand pages for OBGY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. In her sixth year, she transitioned to digital notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Her initial focus was on understanding concepts, watching videos, and revising notes on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. She started solving QBank questions later, in her sixth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

> "There can be various approaches and that depends totally upon you what approach you want to follow... The only thing what you have to remember is that before you land to India... you should be well prepared with at least 10 to 12 subjects." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:08">[05:45:08]</a>

## Pre-India Preparation
Dr. Singh completed all 19 subjects using Marrow's main videos before returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. She even watched the main videos for subjects like OBGY and Surgery twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This comprehensive early preparation is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

## Post-India Strategy: Revision and Practice

### Revision Phase
Upon arriving in India (August), Dr. Singh shifted her focus to watching Marrow's revision videos for most subjects and revising their corresponding notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. She did not revisit the main video notes during this phase, emphasizing the conciseness of revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

### QBank and Grand Tests (GTS)
From August to October, she watched revision videos and simultaneously solved QBank questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. She solved 597 QBank modules, focusing on major subjects like OBGY, Surgery, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. These were NEET PG modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

Dr. Singh started taking Grand Tests (GTS) on August 7th and continued weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Her scores consistently improved, starting from 186 in her first GT and consistently scoring over 200+ from October onwards, reaching 243 in her mock exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. She completed 20 to 24 GTS before the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

### GT Review Strategy
For reviewing GTS, she maintained a "GT notebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. She noted down topics where she made mistakes and reviewed them from her main notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. For silly mistakes, she only read the explanation provided in the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This method helped her strengthen weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

### Last Two Months and Final 10 Days
In the last two months of her preparation (November onwards), Dr. Singh focused solely on revision and GTS, avoiding new MCQs or QBank modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. She planned for four full revisions before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. In the final 10 days, she primarily revised her GT notebook, focusing on frequently mistaken topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. Instead of solving previous year NEET PG/INICET questions, she watched recall videos for these exams, finding them more efficient for reviewing concepts and common questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow's Features
Dr. Singh utilized various features of Marrow, including:
*   **Main Videos**: For initial comprehensive study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **QBank**: Considered the "gold standard" for practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTS)**: For assessing progress and exam simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Revision Videos**: For concise and effective revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   **Pearls**: Used for quick reviews, especially during travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.
*   **Recall Videos**: For efficient review of previous year questions and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:17]</a>.

## [[advice_for_future_fmge_exam_takers | Advice for Future FMGE Exam Takers]]

Dr. Kriti Singh's [[fmge_exam_preparation_strategies | FMGE exam preparation strategies]] emphasize:

*   **Start Early**: Begin preparation well in advance, ideally completing subjects before returning to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.
*   **Be Consistent**: [[importance_of_consistent_study_habits_for_fmge | Consistency]] is crucial for success in any exam, including FMGE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Concepts**: The FMGE exam is evolving, becoming more clinical, concept-based, and integrated. Rote learning (mugging up single-liner questions) is no longer sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. Clear concepts are essential for solving integrated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.
*   **Aim High**: Develop the confidence to aim for 200+ marks, rather than just clearing the pass threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Follow a Clear Strategy**: Having a well-defined and adhered-to study plan is a very important trait for clearing exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

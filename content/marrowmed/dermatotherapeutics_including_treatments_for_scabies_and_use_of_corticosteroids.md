Dermatotherapeutics is a crucial area in dermatology, covering various treatments for skin conditions. Recent exams have included questions on treatment for infections, sexually transmitted infections, and dermatotherapeutics itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Treatment for Scabies

Scabies treatment involves various topical and oral medications. The choice of treatment often depends on the patient's age and specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Permethrin 5%
*   **Concentration:** Permethrin 5% is used for scabies, while 1% is used for pediculosis (lice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **First-line Treatment:** It is considered the first-line treatment for infants aged 2 months or older, children, adults, pregnant individuals, and lactating individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Safety and Efficacy:** Permethrin 5% is noted as the safest and most effective option among available drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. It is not approved for infants less than 2 months old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Ivermectin
*   **Usage:** Ivermectin is a very effective drug for scabies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Contraindications:** It is not approved for individuals weighing less than 15 kg or under 5 years of age due to a high risk of neurotoxicity from an immature blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Lindane (Gamma Benzene Hexachloride)
*   **Contraindications:** Lindane is contraindicated in infants and children younger than 10 years due to high chances of neurotoxicity and seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Benzyl Benzoate
*   **Concentration:** Available in emulsions from 10% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Typical Use:** The typical concentration for adults is 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. For children older than one year, 10% can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Infants:** Its use in infants is controversial; some references advise against it, while others suggest diluting it to 6.25% to minimize skin irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Action:** It inhibits respiratory spirals, leading to asphyxiation of the mite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Crotamiton 10% Cream or Lotion
*   **Advantages:** Besides its scabicidal effect, crotamiton also possesses an anti-pruritic effect, helping to manage the itch associated with scabies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Infants:** It is considered safe for infants under medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Efficacy:** While safe for infants, it is less effective than permethrin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Topical Sulfur
*   **Infants:** Topical sulfur is approved and safe for infants less than 2 months old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of Action:** It works via keratolytic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Side Effects:** The most important side effects are a burning sensation and a bad odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

For scabies in infants, permethrin 5% and crotamiton 10% can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Precipitated sulfur can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Topical Corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids have various side effects, which can be remembered using the acronym "STEROID" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>:

*   **S** - **Skin thinning**: Leading to atrophy and striae formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **T** - **Telangiectasia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
*   **E** - **Ecchymosis** and easy bruisability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **R** - **Rosacea**: Can trigger rosacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **O** - **Opportunistic infections**: Steroids should not be given in active infections as they can trigger folliculitis or steroid-modified tinea (tinea incognito) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **I** - **Induced acne** (steroid acne or acneiform eruption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a> and **Increased hair growth** (hypertricosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **D** - **Decreased pigmentation** (hypopigmentation) and delayed healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This is why steroids are found in harmful skin lightening creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

Hypertricosis, acneiform eruption, and atrophy are correct side effects of topical corticosteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

### Ceruloderma
Bluish-gray skin discoloration, known as ceruloderma, is *not* a side effect of topical corticosteroids, as they cause hypopigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Ceruloderma means blue to slate-gray discoloration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
Important drug causes of ceruloderma include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>:
*   **Antiarrhythmics:** Amiodarone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>
*   **Antibiotics:** Minocycline (used in acne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>
*   **Antimalarials:** Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>
*   **Argyria:** Due to consumption of silver compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>
*   **Antipsychotics:** Chlorpromazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>

*   **2006:** Approved for multiple myeloma when used with dexamethasone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### Mechanism of Action
Thalidomide exhibits several actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>:
*   **Anti-inflammatory:** Acts on TNF-alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

*   **Anti-cancer action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### Not an Anti-Metabolite
Thalidomide is **not** an anti-metabolite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Common anti-metabolites used in dermatological clinical practice include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>:
*   Methotrexate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>

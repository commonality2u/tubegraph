## Parents' Perspective on Their Child's Achievement

Parents often view their child's achievements as a dream come true, sometimes even rechecking results multiple times to confirm the reality of such a high rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. For Dr. Somya's father, hearing about his son's success was "one of the best news he's heard in his lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. His mother expressed immense happiness, excitement, and even cried upon learning the news, feeling "so much lucky to get him as my son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Beyond academic [[importance_of_family_support_in_academic_success | support]], parents play a significant role in shaping their child's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Dr. Somya's mother expressed her primary wish for him to be a "very very good person in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. She described him as very obedient and noted that he often guides them, constantly thinking about his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Support During Challenging Times

Parental [[role_of_support_system_in_exam_preparation | support]] becomes even more critical during difficult periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when Dr. Somya's mother and grandmother were infected, it was a "difficult time" for the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Dr. Somya Aditya, who achieved a rank two in the INI CET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, extensively utilized [[Use and benefits of educational platforms like Marrow | Marrow]]'s educational resources throughout his medical studies and exam preparation. His strategy involved early subscription, systematic video watching, and a multi-cycle approach to the question bank.

## Marrow Subscription and Initial Approach

Dr. Somya subscribed to [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] early in his preparation, starting from his third year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Before starting subjects like ENT and Community Medicine, he had already subscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. In his third year, he completed videos for ENT and Community Medicine, along with parts of final-year subjects such as Medicine, Surgery, OBGY, and PSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This early start aimed to ensure he could view all third and fourth-year videos before his final professional exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. After his final MBBS exams, he revisited first and second-professional subjects, completing them by mid-internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Video and Note-Taking Strategy

Dr. Somya used [[Utilizing online resources like Marrow effectively | Marrow]]'s printed notes, marking on them and adding extra points learned directly from the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. He initially used Edition 5 notes and later watched selective videos from Edition 6, adding subsequent points to his existing notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

He adopted a proactive approach to updates:
> "Whenever New Edition comes, whenever new updates are being added, it becomes a bit difficult but we have to accept this because the medical field is like like that we cannot stick on to the only the history and we have to move on we have to accept this part because in I I set definitely new drugs and very recent updates come in the exam so that is only a part and parcel of the exam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Revision Cycles
For clinical subjects, Dr. Somya always read the main video notes, even if he did so quickly, brushing through all topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. He completed two to three cycles of main subjects and about two cycles for shorter subjects during his internship before the NEET PG exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. For first and second-professional subjects, he watched main videos for selective topics and read the rest from revision notes and the [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## QBank Utilization

Dr. Somya's [[Effective use of QBank and Marrow resources | QBank]] strategy was integrated with his video watching:
*   **Sequential Solving**: After watching a "chunk of videos" (e.g., 10 to 12 videos on a particular topic), he would then solve the corresponding [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Completion**: He completed the entire [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] before his May exam and before starting to give Grand Tests (GTS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Revision of Mistakes**: He realized that doing the [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] only once was not enough and committed to revising his mistakes multiple times to rectify them for the real exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Bookmark System**: He extensively bookmarked questions, using different star and question mark bookmarks to categorize them according to his study pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. These bookmarked questions were revisited whenever he started a new revision cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**: Dr. Somya found the previous year questions in the [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] to be the "most helpful" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. He noted that the recall questions were authentic, with clear explanations and coverage of possible permutations for future exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. He revised all 19 subjects' PYQs from the [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | QBank]] two to three weeks before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## Other Marrow Features and General Approach

*   **MCQ Discussion Videos**: He used MCQ discussion videos as a self-test, pausing to formulate his answer before watching the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. He found these sessions interactive and relaxing compared to intense note study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Marrow Pearls**: He read selective [[Utilizing educational apps like Marrow for medical studies | Marrow]] pearls and found that the related MCQs at the end of each pearl section helped him gain a good grasp of the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Grand Tests (GTs)**: He started giving GTs from his mid-internship, after completing one revision cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. He prioritized giving GTs live to avoid them becoming a future liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. When his GT ranks dipped, he used this as a signal to prepare more and started another revision cycle, focusing on his weakest subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Balancing Internship and Studies

Dr. Somya managed his internship by studying in the small windows of time he had after returning home from duties, especially before sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. He utilized free time during lighter postings or short subject rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. He found that revising main video notes during internship helped him relate theoretical knowledge to practical ward experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

## Advice for Aspirants

Dr. Somya emphasizes consistency and integrating clinical experience:
*   **Hard Work Pays Off**: He advises students to continue their hard work, as it will definitely pay off in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Preparation**: Success in these exams is not just about the last few months but reflects preparation throughout MBBS and internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Clinical Experience**: Many questions come directly from ward experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Attending internship and gaining experience from wards, along with seeing patients during undergraduate years, is "extremely extremely important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. No video can substitute the clinical knowledge gained from patient interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Interns, despite less study time, gain valuable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

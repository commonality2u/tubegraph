Dr. Trupti, who secured Rank 1 in the recently conducted INI CET exam, highlights the pivotal role of personalized revision strategies and consistent engagement with mock tests and question banks in her journey from a NEET PG rank of 19,000 to a top rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Foundational Study and Marrow Resources

Dr. Trupti began her preparation as a Marrow Plan C subscriber in her third year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. She primarily used Marrow notes, supplementing them with her own additional points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. In her fourth year, she watched Marrow videos to gain clarity on subjects and supplemented this knowledge with textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. She did not engage with question banks during her third and fourth years, focusing mainly on theoretical understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Strategic Use of Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. Trupti began giving [[importance_of_grant_tests_and_mock_exams | Grand Tests]] (GTs) after her internship, as her internship was demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Initially, she took GTs once a month, increasing the frequency to once every 15 days after accumulating sufficient knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Overcoming Plateaus in GT Scores

When her GT scores plateaued, Dr. Trupti devised a personalized strategy:
*   **GT Mistake Book:** She created a "GT book" in the last two to three months before the exam, primarily to record mistakes from topics she had already studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This small notebook contained only her incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Same-Day Review:** She made it a point to review the entire GT on the same day it was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Her review process involved:
    *   Starting from her weakest subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   Quickly reviewing correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Reading incorrect answers in detail and adding them to her GT notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Strategic Question Practice and Custom Modules

Dr. Trupti emphasized the [[importance_of_practice_questions_and_revision | importance of practice questions]]. During her first revision, she solved 50 questions per day, increasing to 100 questions per day later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Using Marrow Custom Modules
She regularly used Marrow's custom modules for targeted [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question bank practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Initial Focus:** She first completed all previous year questions (PYQs) from the dedicated PYQ modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Tag Selection:** Afterwards, she used specific tags like "NEET," "AIIMS," and "clinical questions" for her custom modules, including image-based questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** She included all difficulty levels in her custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **No Fixed Target:** She did not set a target for the number of correct answers in custom modules, acknowledging that new questions can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Bookmarking:** She bookmarked questions she got wrong but did not always revisit them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Instead, in the last few days, she solved questions tagged with the "S" (bookmark) hashtag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Revision Strategies Leading to the Exam

Dr. Trupti's [[exam_strategy_and_revision_tactics | revision tactics]] were highly structured:
*   **Last 20 Days:** She dedicated the last 20 days to covering all subjects once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Last 5 Days:** In the final five days, she quickly went through only the highlighted points in her notes to ensure facts were fresh in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This visual impression of subjects provided confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Hypothetical NEET PG Strategy (20 days out):** If she were preparing for NEET PG with 20 days left, she would divide the time into one day per subject, focusing on notes and previous year questions (PYQs) from custom modules. The last five days would be for revision of highlighted points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Overcoming Setbacks and Maintaining Motivation

Her journey involved a significant jump from a NEET PG rank of 19,000 to INI CET rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Acceptance:** After NEET PG, she accepted her rank because she hadn't prepared extensively for it, only covering 10-11 subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This acceptance was crucial, as it allowed her to perform better the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Confidence Booster:** Her November INI CET rank of 115 was a major confidence booster, indicating her potential for a top rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Parental Support:** Her parents' support was instrumental in her decision to take another shot at the exam despite a good rank of 115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. She hadn't aimed for November INI CET, so she wasn't fatigued and felt ready to try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Advice for Future Students

Dr. Trupti offers key advice for students, especially those starting in their third year:
*   **Watch Videos and Read Textbooks:** Do all videos properly and ensure to read textbooks, avoiding shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. She referred to Indian standard books like SRB for Surgery and Ramdas Nayak for Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Read consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Clinical Application:** Follow clinics, which she considers very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   **Sincere Internship:** Work sincerely during internship, as it makes a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Early GTs:** Start giving [[the_role_of_revision_and_practice_tests | Grand Tests]] as early as possible once preparation for the exam begins, without waiting for the course to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

Dr. Trupti's success underscores the significance of adapting study techniques, utilizing comprehensive review methods like her "GT book," and consistently engaging with mock tests and question banks to achieve exam success. Her journey exemplifies that accepting setbacks and having a strong support system are crucial for long-term motivation and achieving top ranks.

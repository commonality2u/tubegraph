This article outlines strategies for success in the NEET PG exam, based on the insights of a top-ranking student.

## Overview
The approach to the NEET PG exam involves consistent effort, a positive mindset, and effective utilization of resources, emphasizing that every individual needs to devise their own [[Strategies for NEET PG exam | strategy]] [00:05:50].

## General Approach & Mindset
*   **Keep Going**: The motto during preparation, especially when facing challenges like a hectic internship or unexpected incidents, was "just keep going" and "take it one day at a time" [00:00:21].
*   **Maintain Balance**: Recognizing that not every day is the same, some days will be more positive, allowing for more study hours, while on other days, even a little effort like solving a few questions or a mini-test makes the day productive [00:00:31].
*   **Enjoy Learning**: The preparation process should involve putting your heart into studying and enjoying the learning [00:02:29, 00:02:34].
*   **Emotional Detachment**: Do not attach yourself too much emotionally to the exam or make it a "life or death" situation. It is merely a transit phase from MBBS to post-graduation [00:18:02].
*   **Consistency**: [[Strategies for NEET PG exam | Consistency]] is very important throughout the preparation period, especially on days when motivation is low. Even a single MCQ solved contributes to knowledge [00:19:35, 00:20:06].
*   **Embrace Tests**: Instead of fearing tests, it's important to enjoy giving them and facing as many questions as possible to overcome fear [00:20:34, 00:20:49].
*   **Small Steps**: Keep the momentum going; even solving one question a day is better than doing nothing [00:20:02, 00:21:07].

## Study Resources
*   **Marrow**: Utilized as a primary resource, specifically Edition 5, for its emphasis on conceptual knowledge required for clinical subjects [00:02:08, 00:02:18].
    *   **Videos**: Praised for engaging content, such as Dr. Chetanya's anesthesia videos with fun facts [00:00:04], Sakshi Ma'am's Obstetrics and Gynaecology videos with models and dummy representations [00:04:02], and Ran Sir's Surgery videos with images and detailed clarifications [00:03:47]. Manisha Ma'am's ENT teaching style was also highlighted [00:04:24].
    *   **Question Banks (QBank)**: Used to understand question patterns and inculcate learned facts and concepts [00:02:42, 00:04:56]. Explanations in QBank cover topics in depth, including ruling out options and providing "pearls" [00:09:04].
    *   **Custom Modules**: Used during free periods of internship duty to quickly solve mini-tests and review [00:16:11].
    *   **Revision Videos/Notes**: For major subjects like Surgery, Obstetrics, Gynaecology, ENT, and Ophthalmology, revision video notes were used towards the end of preparation to save time [00:16:41, 00:17:26].
*   **Standard Textbooks**: Used in conjunction with video lectures to find related text and information [00:04:48].
*   **Topper Videos**: Watching videos of previous year toppers helped in understanding different [[Strategies for NEET PG exam | strategies]] and identifying helpful points to incorporate [00:05:33].

## Study Timeline & Habits
*   **Early Start**: Beginning preparation early is key to finishing regular videos, question banks, and allocating enough time for Grand Tests and mock exams [00:18:46, 00:19:01, 00:19:08].
*   **Foundation Building**: It's essential to build a broad and strong conceptual foundation in the early years of MBBS through standard textbooks or a mix of books and videos [00:10:21, 00:10:30]. Strong concepts aid retention and provide an edge in later stages when returning to textbooks or main notes isn't feasible [00:10:39, 00:10:58].
*   **Progression**:
    *   Later half of second year/early third year: Solved question banks for second-year subjects [00:02:54].
    *   Third year: Started watching videos, covering almost half of final year subjects and all third-year subjects [00:03:04, 00:04:39].
    *   Final year: Watched remaining final year videos and started giving Grand Tests [00:03:15, 00:03:19, 00:15:00].
    *   Internship: Continued giving Grand Tests regularly [00:03:23, 00:15:15].

## Note-Making Strategies
*   **Mixed Approach**: A combination of handwritten notes for some subjects (Pharmacology, Pathology, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology) and printed notes for others, depending on time availability [00:05:05, 00:12:45, 00:12:51].
*   **Highlighting**: Used color coding, but found that highlighting previous topics with a different highlighter towards the end was more effective [00:13:18, 00:13:27].
*   **Selective Information**: Be very selective when adding information from question banks to notes, only including highly catchy or conceptual facts that were previously unknown to avoid making notes too bulky [00:13:41]. The goal of notes is conciseness for quick revision [00:14:27].

## Test-Taking and MCQ Practice
*   **Regular Grand Tests**: Regular practice of Grand Tests is a crucial element as it's an MCQ-based exam, and MCQ-solving skills are integral [00:03:29, 00:03:33, 00:08:51].
    *   Frequency: Started Grand Tests in final year, then increased frequency during internship: initially once every 15-20 days, then once every 10 days, and in the last 3-4 months, once every 5-7 days [00:15:00, 00:15:17].
    *   Motivation: Grand Tests were a favorite learning tool and a go-to activity when feeling bored or unsure what to study [00:08:35, 00:14:53].
*   **Simulating Exam Environment**: Giving Grand Tests in a college library's computer zone with friends helped simulate the actual exam environment and practice avoiding distractions [00:07:06, 00:07:21].
*   **Exam Pattern & Strategy**: For the NEET PG 2024 pattern (five sets of 40 questions, 42 minutes per set) [00:06:11]:
    *   **One Question at a Time**: Tackled by focusing on one question at a time, giving appropriate time, ruling out wrong options, and aiming for the best possible answer [00:06:34].
    *   **Time Management**: Aimed to finish the first pass of questions in 32-35 minutes, using the remaining time to review skipped or marked questions [00:06:47].
    *   **Skipping Tough Questions**: Skipped tough or unknown questions on the first pass (e.g., 6-7 questions) and revisited them later. This strategy allows focusing on known questions first and then using remaining time for potentially difficult ones based on ruling out options or best guesses [00:07:46, 00:08:01, 00:08:11, 00:08:24].
*   **Mock Tests**: Participating in mock tests (like Marrow's free ones) provides a reflection of potential rank [00:15:34, 00:16:04].

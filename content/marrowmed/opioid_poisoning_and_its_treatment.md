Opioid poisoning is a critical condition often encountered in clinical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It is important to recognize its key characteristics for prompt and effective [[management_strategies_for_opioid_addiction_and_related_therapies | management]].

## Clinical Presentation

Patients experiencing [[common_poisonings_and_their_symptoms_in_forensic_toxicology | opioid poisoning]] typically present with a triad of symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>:
*   **Pinpoint Pupils** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>
*   **Respiratory Depression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>
*   **Coma or Unconsciousness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>

Other potential signs include cyanosis (blue skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Patients are often found non-responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Treatment

The primary [[common_poisons_and_their_antidotes | treatment]] for [[common_poisonings_and_their_symptoms_in_forensic_toxicology | opioid poisoning]] is the administration of **Intravenous (IV) Naloxone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. It is considered the [[common_poisons_and_their_antidotes | treatment of choice]] for opioid poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Naloxone vs. Naltrexone

While both naloxone and naltrexone are opioid antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, naloxone is preferred for acute poisoning due to its intravenous administration route and rapid action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Naltrexone is an oral medication, making it unsuitable for unconscious patients and its slower onset of action is not ideal for emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. When given a choice between the two for acute poisoning, naloxone should always be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

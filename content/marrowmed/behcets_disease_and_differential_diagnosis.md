Behcet's disease is classified as a [[neutrophilic_dermatosis | neutrophilic dermatosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> and a form of vasculitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Specifically, it is categorized as a variable vessel vasculitis, meaning it can involve small, medium, and large vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Clinical Features

Key clinical features often associated with Behcet's disease include:
*   Bilateral panuveitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>
*   AOC cytis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>
*   Association with [[inflammatory_bowel_disease | Crohn's disease]] more so than ulcerative colitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>
*   Positive Pathergy test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>

A common site for ulcers in Behcet's disease is the scrotum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Ulcers are not typically seen on the dorsum of the penis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Pathergy Test
The Pathergy test is a diagnostic indicator for Behcet's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. It detects a hypersensitivity response to an intradermal injection or a scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. A saline injection, for example, can produce this hypersensitivity response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

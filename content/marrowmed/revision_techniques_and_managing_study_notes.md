Dr. Sayani, who secured an impressive Rank 5 in the November INI CET exam on her first attempt, shared her approach to [[revision_techniques_and_managing_short_preparation_time | effective revision]] and managing study notes. She began using Marrow in her second year of MBBS during the 2020 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Approach to Study Notes
Dr. Sayani initially created her own notes up until her third year, covering subjects like ENT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, for final year subjects such as Surgery, Medicine, and OB, she decided to purchase Marrow's ready-made notes to save time due to the extensive amount of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Her strategy for [[effective_notetaking_and_study_techniques | managing study notes]] involved:
*   **Annotation:** She actively annotated the purchased Marrow notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Integration of Question Bank Information:** After completing a chapter's video lectures, she would attempt the corresponding question bank. Any new information or concepts found in the question bank that were not present in the videos were added directly to her notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This process ensured her notes became a comprehensive "complete source" for primary reading and future revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Conciseness for Revision:** She emphasized the importance of making notes "crisp" to facilitate quick and [[efficient_study_habits_and_notetaking | effective revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Revision Strategy
Dr. Sayani highlighted that the last 10 days of preparation and the final [[revision_techniques_and_managing_short_preparation_time | revision]] are "very vital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Her [[study_and_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams | revision techniques]] included:
*   **First Aid Integration:** She used First Aid as a primary revision tool and augmented it by adding relevant Marrow notes, including crucial volatile points shared by Marrow faculties. This created a personalized revision copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Marrow Revision Videos:** She utilized Marrow's Delta videos and 6.5 revision videos, describing them as "super fast," "super crisp," and "very concise to the point," significantly aiding her [[revision_techniques_and_managing_short_preparation_time | revision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These videos are particularly useful for quickly covering material or summarizing subjects that might have been left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Marathon Participation:** Dr. Sayani participated in Marrow's marathons, such as the one before NEET PG, which helped push her out of her comfort zone and increase her study pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Grand Test Analysis for Revision
Dr. Sayani's consistent improvement in her Grand Test (GT) scores was attributed to her meticulous analysis strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. She recommends analyzing GTs immediately after the results are released, ideally targeting one to one-and-a-half days for a complete review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Delaying the review can lead to forgetting the "freshness" of the questions and mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Her [[effective_use_of_grand_tests_and_revision_notes | GT analysis]] process:
1.  **Wrong Questions First:** She started by reviewing all the questions she answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
2.  **Unattempted Questions Next:** Following the incorrect answers, she focused on questions she had not attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
3.  **Correct Questions (Briefly):** Finally, she would quickly glance through the questions she answered correctly. This step was crucial to ensure she understood the correct explanations for questions she might have guessed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Marrow's guess tracking feature was useful here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Key Advice for Juniors
Dr. Sayani advises aspiring students to:
*   **Study Smart:** Avoid excessive pressure and focus on [[approaches_to_effective_notetaking_and_revision_techniques | studying smart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Sources:** Be consistent and trust the chosen study material, avoiding "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) and distractions from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Revision:** Make notes crisp and precise, as [[importance_of_notetaking_and_revision_techniques_in_medical_studies | revision]] is "very vital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

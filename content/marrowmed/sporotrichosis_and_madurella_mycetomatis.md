### Implantation Mycosis
[[Fungal and bacterial infections | Fungal infections]] are considered very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:31">[09:29:31]</a>. Both Sporotrichosis and Madurella mycetomatis are examples of implantation mycosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:26">[09:23:26]</a>. Implantation mycosis involves the traumatic inoculation of the fungus into the skin from an external source, often from breaking vegetarian matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:41">[08:36:41]</a>.

### Sporotrichosis
Sporotrichosis is also known as Rose Gardener's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:35">[07:19:35]</a>.

#### Clinical Presentation
The characteristic history for Sporotrichosis involves a gardener with a history of a prick after a stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:39">[07:31:39]</a>. Patients generally present with nodulo-ulcerating lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:39">[07:37:39]</a>. There is often proximal extension and a linear pattern of lesions along the lymphatics of the extremity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:43">[07:40:43]</a>. This linear pattern occurs because the organism has an affinity for the lymphatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:48">[07:46:48]</a>.

#### Diagnostic Findings
Aspiration microscopy using a lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) mount shows the presence of Kia arranged in an RC or Daisy-like pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:03">[07:51:03]</a>. This finding is very characteristic of Sporotrichosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:15">[07:15:15]</a>.

### Madurella mycetomatis
Madurella mycetomatis produces a disease called Mycetoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:16">[08:12:16]</a>.

#### Transmission
This organism is typically transmitted by the bare foot in the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:12">[08:10:12]</a>.

#### Clinical Features of Mycetoma
Mycetoma is characterized by a triad of features:
1.  **Tumor-like swelling** (tummy faction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:55">[08:52:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:58">[08:55:58]</a>.
2.  **Healed sinuses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:03">[09:00:03]</a>.
3.  **Discharging grains** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:07">[09:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:09">[09:07:09]</a>.

Grains are considered colonies of the micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:13">[09:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:17">[09:13:17]</a>.

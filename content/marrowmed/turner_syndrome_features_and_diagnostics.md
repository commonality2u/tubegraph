Turner syndrome is a common [[congenital_diseases_and_their_diagnostics_in_pediatrics | chromosomal disorder]] that frequently appears in medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. Questions about Turner syndrome are often encountered, either involving its chromatogram or clinico-pathologic features requiring a diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Genetic Basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>
The genetic hallmark of Turner syndrome is the loss of one X chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. This results in a genotype of XO, meaning affected individuals typically have 45 chromosomes instead of the usual 46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

## Clinical Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>
Key clinical features of Turner syndrome include:
*   **Low posterior hairline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>
*   **Broad chest with widely spaced nipples** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>
*   **Webbed neck** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>: This feature develops because of the resolution of cystic hygroma present when the child is born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Elbow deformity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>
*   **Streak ovaries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>
*   **Short fourth metacarpal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>
*   **Brown spots and knee wipes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>
*   **No menstruation (primary amenorrhea)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>: This is one of the most common causes of primary amenorrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Short stature** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>
*   **Cardiac defects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>: Coarctation of the aorta is a frequently seen cardiac defect and the most common cause of death in patients with Turner syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Lymphedema** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>

### Mnemonic for Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>
A mnemonic to remember the features of Turner syndrome is **CLOWNS**:
*   **C** for cardiac defects (e.g., coarctation of aorta) and cystic hygroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>
*   **L** for lymphedema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>
*   **O** for ovary streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>
*   **W** for webbed neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>
*   **N** for nipples (widely spaced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>
*   **S** for short stature and short fourth metacarpal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>

### Feature Not Associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>
Prominent occiput is **not** a feature of Turner syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

## Diagnostics: Karyogram Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>
Karyogram analysis is crucial for diagnosing [[techniques_for_detecting_chromosomal_aneuploidy | chromosomal aneuploidy]]. A karyogram shows the arrangement of chromosomes in descending order of length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

In Turner syndrome, the karyogram will reveal the loss of one X chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

### Differentiating with Other Aneuploidies using Karyograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>
*   **[[techniques_for_detecting_chromosomal_aneuploidy | Trisomy 13]] (Patau Syndrome)**: The karyogram would show three chromosomes at the 13th position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **[[techniques_for_detecting_chromosomal_aneuploidy | Trisomy 18]] (Edwards Syndrome)**: The karyogram would show three chromosomes at the 18th position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **[[techniques_for_detecting_chromosomal_aneuploidy | Trisomy 21]] (Down Syndrome)**: The karyogram would show three chromosomes at the 21st position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Klinefelter Syndrome**: The karyogram would typically show two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (XXY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

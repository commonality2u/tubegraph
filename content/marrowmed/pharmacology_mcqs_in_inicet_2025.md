The Pharmacology Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) in the INICET May 2025 exam were generally moderate in difficulty, often requiring conceptual understanding and logical reasoning for their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Carbamazepine Toxicity

An 8-year-old patient on carbamazepine developed imbalance and gait ataxia after taking erythromycin for an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Symptoms**: Imbalance and gait ataxia are symptoms of cerebellar toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Options**:
    *   Relapse of epilepsy: Imbalance and gait ataxia are not typical symptoms of epilepsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Erythromycin toxicity: Erythromycin toxicity does not present as imbalance or gait ataxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Hypersensitivity reaction: Imbalance or gait ataxia are cerebellar toxicity symptoms, not typically part of a hypersensitivity reaction, although carbamazepine can cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome or rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Cause**: The patient developed carbamazepine toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism**: Carbamazepine and phenytoin are known to cause cerebellar toxicity, presenting as ataxia and dysarthria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Erythromycin is an enzyme inhibitor that inhibited the metabolism of carbamazepine, increasing the risk of cerebellar toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Types of Tolerance

Tolerance refers to a decreased response to a drug with repeated exposure. The exam included questions on different types of tolerance:

*   **Acute Tolerance**: Rapid tolerance developing with repeated use on a single occasion, such as during a binge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Alcohol and cocaine. A person might use a high dose and not get the expected "kick," leading them to increase the dose, which can result in toxicity or overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Reverse Tolerance**: An increase in response with the repetition of the same dose of the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Cannabis. Some individuals might experience the same "high" with a lesser dose over time, possibly because cannabis is stored in body tissues, leading to a residual effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Cross Tolerance**: If a person develops tolerance to one drug (Drug A), they automatically develop tolerance to another drug (Drug B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Alcohol and benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam). Alcohol acts on GABA-A receptors, and continuous consumption leads to tolerance. Since benzodiazepines also act as GABA-A agonists, a patient tolerant to alcohol will also develop tolerance to benzodiazepines, potentially requiring higher doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Phase One Reactions in Xenobiotics

Drug metabolism typically occurs in two phases:

*   **Phase 1**: In this phase, the drug is broken down, and a functional group is attached to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This functional group is crucial for the drug to bind to a conjugate in Phase 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Phase 2 (Conjugation)**: A conjugate, typically negatively charged, is attached to the drug via the functional group introduced in Phase 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This process makes the drug molecule negative, ionized, and water-soluble, which is important for its excretion from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Therefore, the primary function of Phase 1 reactions is to introduce a functional group for further metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Thalidomide Properties

Thalidomide is a drug with specific uses and side effects:

*   **Uses**: The mnemonic "CATCH PROGRAMS" can help remember its uses:
    *   C (Kaposi's Sarcoma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
    *   A (AIDS-related wasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   T (Transplant complications like Graft-versus-host disease - GVHD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    *   C (Crohn's disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
    *   H (Rheumatoid Arthritis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
    *   P (Pancreatic cancer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
    *   R (Renal cell cancer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
    *   O (Orphan diseases, often relating to Beh√ßet's disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
    *   G (GVHD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    *   R (Rheumatoid arthritis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
    *   A (AIDS-related wasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   M (Multiple Myeloma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   E (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum - ENL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
    *   L (Leprosy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
    *   S (Sarcoidosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
*   **Side Effects**: The mnemonic "IN SPORT CHANNEL" can help remember its side effects:
    *   S (Sedation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> (most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>)
    *   P (Phocomelia) or Teratogenicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
    *   R (Rash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   T (Thrombocytopenia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
    *   C (Constipation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> (most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>)

Thalidomide is used in multiple myeloma and ENL and is known to be teratogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Its immunosuppressive action is not due to anti-metabolic effects, as anti-metabolites typically inhibit folate, purine, or pyrimidine synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## GnRH Receptor Antagonists

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists are drugs often ending in "-golix" or "-relix" (e.g., elagolix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: These drugs decrease the release of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This leads to a decrease in estrogen levels in females and testosterone levels in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Uses**:
    *   **Endometriosis**: Used in endometriosis, which is an estrogen-dependent condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   **Prostate Cancer**: Used in prostate cancer, which is a testosterone-dependent condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   **Controlled Ovulation**: In procedures like In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), GnRH antagonists are used to prevent premature ovulation (LH surge) to allow for timed egg retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Therefore, GnRH receptor antagonists are used for the management of advanced prostate cancer and for controlled ovulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. They are not used for hypogonadal hypogonadism, where increasing, not decreasing, hormone levels would be the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

## Cholestasis Without Portal Inflammation

Some drugs can cause cholestasis (impaired bile flow) without leading to portal inflammation.

*   **Mechanism**: Bile acids are secreted out of hepatocytes via a pump called P-glycoprotein (also known as MDR1 pump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Drugs like estrogen, erythromycin, or cyclosporine also use this same pump for their excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. When these drugs are administered, they compete with bile acids for excretion, inhibiting bile acid outflow and leading to cholestasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Estrogen and androgenic steroids are known to cause cholestasis without portal inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Fenoldopam in AKI

Fenoldopam is administered intravenously to patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and declining urine output, for example, after cardiac surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: Fenoldopam is a D1 agonist, which causes renal vasodilation, leading to diuresis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Specifically, dopamine D1 receptor agonism causes dilation of afferent and efferent arterioles, increasing the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Comparison with Dopixamine**: Both fenoldopam and dopixamine are D1 agonists that cause renal vasodilation and diuresis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, fenoldopam also has alpha-2 agonism (like clonidine), which can decrease blood pressure via central sympatholysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, while dopixamine is a beta-agonist that causes vasodilation and also decreases blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Loading Dose Calculation (Oral Route)

The calculation of a drug's loading dose depends on specific pharmacological parameters.

*   **IV Loading Dose Formula**: For intravenous (IV) administration, the loading dose (LD) is calculated as: LD = Volume of Distribution (VD) √ó Target Plasma Concentration (CT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
    *   **VD**: Represents how widely a drug is distributed in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   **CT**: The desired plasma concentration for effective treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Oral Loading Dose Formula**: When the drug is given by an oral or any other non-IV route, bioavailability (F) must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The formula becomes: LD = (VD √ó CT) / F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
    *   For IV administration, F is 1, so it doesn't affect the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. For oral routes, F is typically less than 1 (e.g., 0.7 or 0.5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

Therefore, for an orally administered drug, the loading dose depends on bioavailability, volume of distribution, and target plasma concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. It does not depend on half-life for the loading dose itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Drug Schedules

Drug schedules classify drugs based on their potential for abuse and medical use.

*   **Schedule X**: Drugs with high abuse potential, such as morphine, amphetamine, and ketamine, belong to Schedule X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Schedule Z**: This schedule is for drugs used in animals (veterinary drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Schedule H**: Drugs that can be given only with a valid prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Vaccines are often included here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Schedule G**: Drugs that should not be taken without medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Insulin is an example often listed in this schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Essentially, every Schedule H drug also belongs to Schedule G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Bempedoic Acid

Bempedoic acid is a relatively newer drug used in the management of dyslipidemia.

*   **Mechanism**: Cholesterol synthesis involves enzymes like ATP citrate lyase and HMG-CoA reductase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Statins, the drug of choice for lowering LDL, inhibit HMG-CoA reductase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Bempedoic acid, a pro-drug, forms bempedoic coenzyme A, which competitively inhibits ATP citrate lyase, an enzyme acting earlier in the cholesterol synthesis pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Use**: It was designed to address resistance to statins, which can occur due to polymorphism in HMG-CoA reductase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Bempedoic acid can be added to statin therapy to enhance its effect in patients with dyslipidemia resistant to diet and statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Properties**: It is a dicarboxylic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

Therefore, bempedoic acid is a dicarboxylic acid, inhibits cholesterol synthesis, and is used in dyslipidemia, particularly when there is resistance to statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. It competitively inhibits ATP citrate lyase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Amipramine and Diphenhydramine Interaction

A patient on amipramine for depression was prescribed diphenhydramine for nasal congestion.

*   **Diphenhydramine**: This is an H1 blocker (antihistaminic) but is often used for its anti-muscarinic properties due to its highly sedative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Amipramine**: This is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that increases norepinephrine and serotonin by inhibiting their reuptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. However, imipramine also blocks various receptors, including muscarinic, H1, and alpha-1 receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

Both diphenhydramine and amipramine are muscarinic blockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. This common pharmacological action is the true statement regarding their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

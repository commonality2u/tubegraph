Dr. Jasurya, who secured Rank 5 in the May 2025 INIC exam, highlighted the critical role of grand tests (GTs) and mock exams in his preparation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These tests were a fundamental component of his study strategy, serving as an objective measure of his progress and a tool for identifying and improving weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Jasurya's Approach to Grand Tests

Jasurya adopted a highly structured approach to [[role_of_grand_tests_and_question_banks_in_exam_preparation | grand tests]]:
*   **Early Baseline Assessment** He took his first GT without preparation to establish a baseline score, achieving 118 correct out of 200 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Consistent Scheduling** After assessing his baseline, he decided to start proper GTs six months before the actual exam, giving a GT every 10 to 15 days without fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation | consistency]] was a habit he maintained diligently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Serious Engagement** During the three-and-a-half-hour GT, he was intensely focused, treating it like the main exam and aiming to answer every question he knew correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Evolution of GT Scores and Ranks

Jasurya's GT scores showed a clear upward trend, reflecting his improving preparation:
*   **Initial Score** His first "proper" GT, given six months before the exam after finishing about 50% of the syllabus, resulted in 136 correct answers and a rank of approximately 300-400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Post-Revision Improvement** After his first revision, scores climbed to 150-155 correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance** During his second revision, scores further increased to 155-170, consistently hovering between 165 and 175 in the last five to six exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Mock Exam Performance** In the INI mock exam, he achieved a rank of 228 with 166 correct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. His best GT rank was in the top 20, and he consistently ranked between 50 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Leveraging GT Analytics for Improvement

The analytics provided by GTs were crucial for Jasurya's progress:
*   **Identifying Weaknesses** He emphasized that GTs provide an objective measure of preparation, highlighting specific subjects where one is weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Targeted Study** To overcome plateaus in scores, he would use the GT analytics, which listed the five subjects he performed worst in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. He would then dedicate the next 10 to 15 days to studying those specific subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This strategy consistently led to an improvement of two to three questions in his subsequent scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Reviewing Grand Tests

Jasurya's GT review strategy evolved over time:
*   **Initial Detailed Review** Initially, he would review approximately 20 questions per day, thoroughly analyzing every question, even those he answered correctly, to understand why he guessed right or if any gaps remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This meant reviewing all 200 questions over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Focused Review Towards the End** As the exam neared and time became a constraint, he focused only on the questions he got wrong, reviewing them on the same day he took the GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Integration with Other Resources

While Grand Tests were central, Jasurya's overall strategy also involved:
*   **Notes and Question Banks** He primarily relied on reading Marrow's main notes and simultaneously solving relevant [[importance_of_solving_question_banks_and_grand_tests | question bank]] modules to reinforce topics and test himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question bank]] helped condense notes by highlighting high-yield questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Limited Use of Other Features** He did not extensively use custom modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, or marathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, preferring to bookmark wrong answers in the question bank for revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways on [[importance_of_exams_for_medical_students | Exams]] and Preparation

The discussion emphasized several points about the [[importance_of_personalized_revision_techniques_and_mock_tests | importance of grand tests and mock exams]] and general preparation:
*   **Grand Tests as a Game-Changer** Both Jasurya and Dr. Abasali affirmed that GTs are a "game changer" because they provide an objective measure of preparation and help identify weak subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Non-Linear Growth** Improvement in scores is not linear, and it's essential to accept plateaus as part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Focused Revision** The strategy of using GT analytics to focus on bottom-performing subjects was highlighted as an effective way to improve scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Discipline in Testing** It's crucial to give tests sincerely and with discipline, treating them like actual exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Start Early** Starting preparation early, ideally in the second or third year of MBBS, helps build a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Single Resource Focus** Sticking to one resource and mastering it thoroughly is more effective than using multiple resources superficially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Mental Strength** Students should remain mentally strong and not be swayed by what others are doing, sticking to what works for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Don't Overthink Scores** It's important not to worry excessively about scores throughout the journey, as improvement will come with consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

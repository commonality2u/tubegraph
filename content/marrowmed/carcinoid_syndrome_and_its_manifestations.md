[[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | Carcinoid syndrome]] is characterized by the production of large amounts of substances such as Serotonin, Kallikrein, Bradykinin, and Histamine by [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | neuroendocrine tumors]] (NETs) [00:10:22]. These tumors are also sometimes referred to as carcinoids [00:08:41].

## Manifestations of Carcinoid Syndrome
The manifestations of [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] are primarily due to the various substances released by the tumor [00:10:47].

Specific manifestations and their causes include:
*   **Flushing** is mostly due to Kallikrein [00:11:02].
*   **Bronchospasm** is mostly due to Histamine [00:11:04].
*   **Diarrhea** is mostly due to Serotonin [00:11:07].

### Associated Deficiencies
Patients with [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] may also develop Niacin deficiency [00:12:28]. This occurs because Tryptophan, a precursor for Niacin, is extensively utilized for the formation of Serotonin by the tumor [00:12:31].

## Complications
The most significant complication of [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] is right-sided cardiac involvement, leading to right-sided heart failure [00:12:47]. The most common valvular disease associated with [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] is tricuspid vegetation [00:12:53].

## Influence of Tumor Location and Metastasis
The presentation of [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] can vary depending on the primary location of the [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | neuroendocrine tumor]] and the presence of metastasis [00:11:14].

*   **Midgut and Foregut Carcinoids**: [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | Midgut carcinoids]] (e.g., from the pancreas) and [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | foregut carcinoids]] release their effectors (like Histamine and Serotonin) into the portal circulation [00:11:26]. These substances are then typically cleared at the level of the liver [00:11:35]. Therefore, patients with these primary tumors usually do not exhibit overt [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] manifestations unless they have hepatic metastasis [00:11:39].
*   **Thymic Carcinoids**: Thymic carcinoids, on the other hand, release effectors directly into the systemic circulation, leading to more pronounced [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] [00:11:54].
*   **Prognostic Indicator**: The presence of [[Carcinoid syndrome and its manifestations | carcinoid syndrome]] in a [[understanding_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_pancreatic_conditions | pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] generally indicates the presence of hepatic metastasis [00:12:12].

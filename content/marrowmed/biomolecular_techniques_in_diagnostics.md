Biomolecular techniques play a crucial role in modern diagnostics, enabling the detection and analysis of genetic material, proteins, and molecular interactions. The May 2025 biochemistry session of the INACT recall highlighted several such techniques, particularly within [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genetics]] and microbial strain analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. New questions in the exam included topics like Surface Plasmon Resonance and strain typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Gene Pool Concept
A [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] pool refers to the combination of all [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genes]], including all their alleles, present in a reproducing population or species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This concept is vital for guaranteeing [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genetic]] diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Taking [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genes]] from an inbreeding population would result in less [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genetic]] diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Therefore, a [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] pool is typically derived from a population, not a family, individual, or tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Molecular Biology Blotting Techniques
These techniques are fundamental for detecting specific biomolecules:
*   **Southern Blotting (S)**: Used for DNA detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. While not primarily for DNA replication, it is based on DNA hybridization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Northern Blotting (N)**: Used for RNA detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Western Blotting (W)**: Used for Protein detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
PCR is a widely used technique for amplifying DNA. The number of DNA amplicons generated after `n` cycles can be calculated using the formula `2^n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Half the copies of DNA generated at `n` cycles are found in the `n-1` cycle (e.g., if 26 cycles produce a certain amount, half that amount is produced at 25 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Types of PCR:
*   **Quantitative PCR (qPCR) / Real-time PCR**: Used when doubting a mutation that affects the length of a [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]], such as trinucleotide repeat mutations or large [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] deletions (e.g., CFTR [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. It is also used when [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] dosage is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)**: Detects RNA levels and is primarily used for [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] expression studies, not [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] mutation detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Genetic Testing Methods
The choice of [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] testing method depends on the type of mutation suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

For familial breast and ovarian cancer, specifically mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are typically point mutations or small mutations not affecting length or [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | gene]] dosage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>:
*   Initial steps often involve PCR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)**: Can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   **Sanger Sequencing**: A traditional method that can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Considered the best method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
    *   **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)**: Sequences the entire [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | genome]] but is very costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.
    *   **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)**: Sequences only the coding regions (exons), making it a more cost-effective alternative while still providing comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

### Microbial Strain Typing (Genotyping)
Methods used to identify different mutated strains of the same species of bacteria, such as *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, by analyzing mutations in their DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>:
*   **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)**: Identifies strains using [[recombinant_dna_technology_enzymes | restriction enzyme]]s that cut at unique restriction sites, producing different band patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. It is an older, but widely popular and accessible technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Chromosome Mutation Analysis**: A general category encompassing techniques that analyze changes in chromosomal DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Spoligotyping**: Targets unique spacer sequences located on either side of direct repeats in the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
*   **MIRU-VNTR (Multiple Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number Tandem Repeat) Typing**: Directly types the variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. It offers higher discrimination quality than spoligotyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Such as Whole [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | Genome]] Sequencing, represents the most advanced method for genotyping bacterial strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

## Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
SPR is a real-time, label-free technique used to study molecular interactions, particularly the binding of [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antigen]]s and [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.

### Mechanism and Application:
*   Unlike ELISA, which detects [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | immune complexes]] afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>, SPR measures interactions in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   When an [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antigen]]-[[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] complex forms, it produces plasmon waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   The system measures a "surface plasmon resonance angle" as a physical property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   The SPR curve shows an ascent as [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antigen]]-[[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] association occurs, and a regression during dissociation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
*   SPR is considered a gold standard method for detecting [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] affinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. It determines if an [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] (e.g., a monoclonal [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]]) has affinity towards a specific [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antigen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. It does not measure [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] concentration directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.
*   It is a "label-free" technique, meaning no additional labels are needed for detection, unlike ELISA which typically uses labels to detect the presence of [[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antigen]]-[[immunity_and_diagnostic_tests | antibody]] complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

## Conclusion
The evolving landscape of diagnostics increasingly relies on sophisticated biomolecular techniques. While some questions related to these techniques can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, understanding their principles and applications is essential for modern medical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

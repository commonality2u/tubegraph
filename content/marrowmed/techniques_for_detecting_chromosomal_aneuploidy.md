Chromosomal aneuploidy refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, which can lead to various genetic disorders. Detecting aneuploidy is crucial for diagnosis, especially in prenatal screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Over time, techniques for aneuploidy detection have evolved from conventional methods to more advanced molecular and rapid approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Overview of Detection Techniques

Several [[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods|techniques]] and [[biomolecular_techniques_in_diagnostics|biomolecular techniques]] are employed to detect aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>:

### Conventional Cytogenetics (Karyotyping)

Conventional cytogenetics, specifically karyotyping using the G-banding technique, is a traditional method for detecting chromosomal aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Accuracy**: It has a diagnostic accuracy of 99.4% to 99.8% when used with amniotic fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. For chorionic villus sampling, often used in prenatal screening, the accuracy ranges from 97.5% to 99.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Limitation**: Its primary limitation is a lower resolution compared to newer methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

### Molecular Cytogenetics (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization - FISH)

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) represents an evolution from conventional cytogenetics, offering better resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. It is a technique used to detect aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) / Array CGH

Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is a microarray-based technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Advantage**: It can reveal imbalances across the entire genome, making it effective for finding aneuploidy across all chromosomes, not just specific regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. It is considered an evolved and better technique than FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### Rapid Aneuploidy Detection (RAD) / Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR)

Rapid Aneuploidy Detection (RAD), specifically Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR), is highly important for [[congenital_diseases_and_their_diagnostics_in_pediatrics|prenatal screening]] due to its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Advantages over FISH**:
    *   Less expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
    *   Allows simultaneous processing of much larger samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   QF-PCR has largely replaced interface FISH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

### Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)

MLPA is another technique capable of detecting gene dosage changes, which includes aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

### Sanger Sequencing

Simple Sanger sequencing is generally not sufficient to detect aneuploidy because it sequences an oligonucleotide, not an entire chromosome or genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **Usage in Aneuploidy Detection**: However, if the Sanger sequencing principle is applied within a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform, which allows for massive parallel sequencing, then it becomes possible to sequence entire chromosomes and detect aneuploidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) / Massive Parallel Sequencing

NGS, also known as massive parallel sequencing, allows different DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. This advanced technique enables the parallel sequencing of entire chromosomes, making it a powerful tool for aneuploidy detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

In summary, appropriate techniques for chromosomal aneuploidy detection include:
*   Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>
*   Conventional cytogenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>
*   Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR) / Real-time PCR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>
*   Array CGH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>
*   Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>
*   Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>

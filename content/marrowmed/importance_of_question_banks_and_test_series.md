Dr. Philip, who achieved an impressive rank of six in the INI CET May 2023 exam, highlights the pivotal role of [[using_question_banks_and_mock_exams_effectively | question banks]] and test series in his successful preparation, especially given his limited study time of only five months from January to May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>.

## Strategic Use of Question Banks

Dr. Philip primarily utilized the [[effective_use_of_q_banks_and_test_series | question bank]] for his preparation, noting that it helped shorten the duration of revision compared to the more tedious main videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47">[02:01:47]</a>. He emphasizes that if time is limited, the [[importance_of_using_a_qbank_for_exam_preparation | question bank]] itself can be sufficient as it provides comprehensive explanations for all concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.

### Approach to Solving Questions
Dr. Philip's strategy involved:
*   Solving approximately 700 to 720 question banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:17">[02:37:17]</a>.
*   Starting with subject-wise modules for the first revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:37">[02:50:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:17">[02:53:17]</a>.
*   Completing around 500 modules in two to two and a half months during his initial phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:07">[04:03:07]</a>.

### Custom Modules and Bookmarking
A key aspect of his [[effective_use_question_banks_and_mock_tests | effective use of question banks]] was the strategic use of custom modules and bookmarking:
*   He used custom modules to compile important questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>.
*   He bookmarked questions he found difficult or perceived as important for the exam, including factual questions and those that many candidates would likely solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:17">[03:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:17">[03:20:17]</a>.
*   Initially, he bookmarked around 3,000 questions, which he later reduced to 500-600 after reviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:17">[03:37:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:07">[03:43:07]</a>.
*   From March onwards, he focused on reviewing all wrongly answered questions and utilizing custom modules as mixed bags for all subjects, allowing him to revise multiple subjects concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:17">[04:28:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:07">[04:34:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:07">[04:47:07]</a>.

### Integration with Videos for Conceptual Clarity
While the [[utilizing_question_banks_for_competitive_medical_exams | question bank]] formed the core of his revision, he occasionally referred to main videos for subjects where his concepts were not clear, particularly first-year subjects like anatomy and biochemistry where he lacked confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:27">[05:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:27">[05:17:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:07">[05:24:07]</a>.

## The Significance of Grand Tests (GTs)

Grand Tests (GTs) played a crucial role in Dr. Philip's preparation, providing essential feedback and building confidence.

### GT Taking Strategy
*   He began taking GTs after completing six to eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:07">[05:45:07]</a>.
*   Initially, he took GTs once every 10 to 12 days, increasing to once a week closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:17">[06:20:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:07">[06:23:07]</a>.

### Reviewing GTs
Thorough review of GTs was non-negotiable:
*   He reviewed GTs either on the same day or the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:17">[06:28:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:07">[06:31:07]</a>.
*   His review process prioritized:
    1.  Skipped questions, as he had no idea about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:07">[06:42:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:07">[06:44:07]</a>.
    2.  Wrongly answered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:27">[06:46:27]</a>.
    3.  Questions solved by elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:07">[06:51:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:07">[06:54:07]</a>.
*   He did not review questions he was very confident about due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:07">[07:05:07]</a>.

### Tracking Progress and Identifying Weaknesses
GTs were instrumental in tracking his progress and identifying areas for improvement:
*   His initial GT scores were around 130-135, with ranks of 8,000-9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:07">[05:52:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:07">[05:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:07">[06:00:07]</a>.
*   His final GT showed 170 correct questions and a rank of 17, significantly boosting his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:07">[06:09:07]</a>.
*   He used GT graphs and analytics to monitor his progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:07">[09:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:07">[09:55:07]</a>.
*   Even when his percentile dropped, he understood that it was part of the process and would rise again with correct preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:07">[10:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:07">[10:18:07]</a>.
*   GTs helped him identify his weak subjects. He would revise the "bottom five subjects" from the analytics graph before the next GT for a more thorough review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:07">[10:28:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:07">[10:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:07">[10:38:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:07">[10:44:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:07">[10:51:07]</a>.

## Specific Features for Question Practice

Dr. Philip found certain features particularly helpful for question practice:
*   **Delta MCQ discussion videos**: These videos, especially those by Dr. Renar, effectively explained why certain options were incorrect and clarified frequently mistaken topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:07">[07:35:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:17">[07:37:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:07">[07:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:07">[07:44:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:07">[07:54:07]</a>.
*   **Magic Modules**: These modules compiled questions that candidates answered incorrectly, which was very helpful for targeted revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:07">[07:59:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:07">[08:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:07">[08:04:07]</a>.

Dr. Philip's journey demonstrates that while there are multiple paths to success, a strong focus on [[importance_of_solving_question_banks_and_grand_tests | question banks and test series]] can be a highly effective and time-efficient strategy, especially when coupled with diligent review and self-assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:07">[09:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:07">[09:29:07]</a>.

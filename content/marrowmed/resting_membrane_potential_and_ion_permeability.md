The resting membrane potential (RMP) of a nerve cell is typically around -70 mV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

## Key Ion Responsible for RMP

The increased permeability of potassium ions is responsible for the resting membrane potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Potassium is the sole ion responsible for RMP maintenance and generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, and it has nothing to do with chloride ions in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. The cell is primarily permeable to potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

## Mechanism of RMP Generation

Within a cell, potassium ions are present in higher concentrations inside compared to outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. The cell's membrane is permeable to potassium, allowing for passive diffusion from a high concentration to a low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

This passive diffusion of potassium ions from inside to outside the cell is what generates the resting membrane potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. As positive potassium ions move out, negative charges accumulate inside the cell, creating the "inside negativity" characteristic of the resting membrane potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

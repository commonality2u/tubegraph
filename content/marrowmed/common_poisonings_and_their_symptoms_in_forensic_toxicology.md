In [[Forensic Medicine and Toxicology in NEETPG 2024 | Forensic Medicine and Toxicology]] exams, questions on common poisonings and their symptoms are frequently encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. This article summarizes key information about various poisons discussed in [[Forensic Medicine and Toxicology in NEETPG 2024 | NEETPG 2024]] recall questions.

## Datura Poisoning
Datura poisoning is a common topic in toxicology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.
*   **Symptoms**: Symptoms are anti-cholinergic, including confusion, slurring of speech, dry mouth, dilated pupils, and hot skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.
*   **Common Names**: Datura is often referred to as "Railway poison" or "roadside poison" due to its association with railway and roadside robberies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Toxic Parts**: Every part of the Datura plant is toxic, with roots and seeds being the most toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Active Principles**: The main active principles are hyoscine and atropine, with hyoscine being the major component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
*   **Seed Characteristics**: Datura seeds resemble chili seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. They are dark brown, thicker, have a rough surface, are odorless, and are kidney-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.

## Cocaine Poisoning
[[Drug interactions and toxicities | Cocaine poisoning]] presents with sympathomimetic symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.
*   **Symptoms**: Tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis (increased sweating), and dilated pupils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>.
*   **Differentiation from Datura**: Unlike datura, cocaine causes increased sympathetic activity, including sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.
*   **Differentiation from Opioids**: Unlike morphine or heroin, cocaine causes dilated pupils and tachypnea, not constricted pupils or respiratory depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>.
*   **Associated Syndromes**: Cocaine poisoning is commonly encountered in "body packer syndrome," where individuals smuggle drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>.
*   **Chronic Abuse Triad**: Chronic [[Drug interactions and toxicities | cocaine abuse]] can lead to a triad of septal or palatal ulceration, black staining of the tongue, and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:04">[01:58:04]</a>.
*   **Tactile Hallucination**: A very common symptom is tactile hallucination, also known as "cocaine bugs," Magnan's symptom, or formication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.

## Iron Poisoning
[[Common Poisons and Their Antidotes – Link name: common_poisons_and_their_antidotes | Accidental iron poisoning]] is common in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **Contraindicated Antidote**: British anti-Lewisite (BAL), or dimercaprol, is contraindicated in [[Common Poisons and Their Antidotes – Link name: common_poisons_and_their_antidotes | iron poisoning]], as well as [[poison classification and effects | cadmium poisoning]] and organic mercury poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. The chelate complex formed with these metals is itself toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Treatment of Choice**: Desferrioxamine is the drug of choice for [[Common Poisons and Their Antidotes – Link name: common_poisons_and_their_antidotes | iron poisoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>.
*   **Other Contraindications**: Calcium EDTA is contraindicated in patients with renal failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>.

## Arsenic Poisoning
[[Lead poisoning and its effects on heme synthesis | Arsenic poisoning]] can be acute or chronic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>.
*   **Acute Poisoning**: Causes intense gastroenteritis, resembling cholera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The stomach mucosa appears reddish-pink and velvety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:11">[01:53:11]</a>.
*   **Chronic Poisoning (Arsenicosis)**:
    *   **Nails**: Presents with transverse white lines on the nails, known as Aldrich-Mees lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.
    *   **Skin**: Characterized by "raindrop pigmentation" (dark brown pigmentation) and skin eruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis is also a typical finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>.
    *   **Neuropathy**: Causes peripheral sensory motor polyneuropathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:22">[01:54:22]</a>.
    *   **Other Effects**: Can cause nasal septal perforation and peripheral ischemia, leading to peripheral gangrene (known as "blackfoot disease") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>.
    *   **Carcinogenicity**: [[Lead poisoning and its effects on heme synthesis | Arsenic]] is carcinogenic, causing skin malignancies (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and increasing the incidence of lung, liver, and bladder cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Tests**: Marsh and Reinsch tests are older methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>. Latest tests include Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:24">[01:55:24]</a>.

## Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
[[Aluminium Phosphate Poisoning Diagnosis and Treatment | Ethylene glycol poisoning]] is characterized by metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:06">[01:59:06]</a>.
*   **Source**: Commonly used as an antifreeze solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. It is colorless and odorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.
*   **Metabolism**: Ethylene glycol is metabolized into glycolaldehyde, then glycolic acid, and finally oxalic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
    *   **Glycolic Acid**: Primarily responsible for producing high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
    *   **Oxalic Acid**: Causes hypocalcemia by combining with calcium to produce calcium oxalate crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. This leads to features like Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Fomepizole or ethanol can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. Intravenous calcium gluconate is given to address hypocalcemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

## Methanol Poisoning
[[Phosphorus Poisoning and Treatment | Methanol poisoning]] is often associated with the consumption of cheap, illicit alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.
*   **Symptoms**: Abdominal pain, confusion, and decreased vision (blurring of vision, optic neuritis, or optic atrophy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
*   **Toxic Level**: A methanol blood level of 20 mg% is considered toxic and requires treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Metabolism**: Methanol is converted to formaldehyde, which is then converted to formic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. Both are toxic, but formic acid is the most toxic metabolite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **Acidosis**: Formic acid contributes to acidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. Lactic acid is also produced due to interference in NADH and metabolism, leading to anaerobic metabolism and increased lactic acid formation, further contributing to acidosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   **Treatment**: Fomepizole or ethanol are used as antidotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

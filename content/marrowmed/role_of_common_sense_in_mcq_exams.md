In competitive medical exams like NEET PG, the ability to apply common sense and strategically eliminate incorrect options is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This approach is often as important as direct knowledge recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Predictable Questions and Strategic Thinking

Questions asked in exams like NEET PG can be predictable in their topics, often stemming from previous year's trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, even when questions are not identical to past ones, many require candidates to simply apply their common sense to rule out incorrect options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The NEET PG 2024 examination, for instance, featured numerous questions that could be solved through this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Importance of Ruling Out Options

It is not always necessary to have extensive knowledge about a specific topic or to know every single option to answer a question correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Many times, an answer can be derived by [[second_order_thinking_in_medical_exams_preparation | ruling out other options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This highlights why [[importance_of_solving_mcqs_in_medical_exams | MCQ practice]] is vital for [[exam_strategy_and_mindset_for_medical_competitive_exams | clearing competitive exams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

For example, in a question regarding investigations for cervical erosion with foul-smelling discharge and spotting, even if the ideal answer (colposcopic directed biopsy) wasn't an option, candidates could eliminate choices that included irrelevant tests like Hepatitis B and C, leaving the most plausible remaining options like liquid cytology and HPV testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

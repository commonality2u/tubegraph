This article discusses various middle ear conditions and relevant audiological tests, as recalled from the NEET 2024 ENT questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Tympanic Membrane Perforation

A perforation of the tympanic membrane leads to conductive hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Rinne Test

For a patient with conductive hearing loss, the Rinne test finding will be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

## Glomus Tumors

Patients with glomus tumors often present with pulsatile tinnitus and may show a red mass behind the tympanic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

### Types and Differentiation

*   **Glomus Tympanicum:** Arises from the tympanic plexus on the promontory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   **Glomus Jugulare:** Arises from the jugular bulb, located in the floor of the middle ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. On a CT scan, a glomus jugulare tumor appears as a mass in the jugular bulb area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

## Otosclerosis

Otosclerosis typically affects middle-aged females and presents with progressive, bilateral conductive hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

### Audiological Findings

*   **Air-Bone Gap (AB Gap):** A pure tone audiogram (PTA) in otosclerosis shows an AB gap, indicating conductive hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Kahar Notch:** The PTA also reveals a dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz, known as the Kahar notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

### Clinical Signs

*   **Schwartze Sign:** This sign is characterized by a flamingo pink tympanic membrane in an active otosclerosis due to increased vascularity of the active focus on the promontory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

> [00:33:20] **Hennebert Sign:** A positive Hennebert sign is seen in conditions like [[Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Test and Third Window Syndrome | third window syndrome]] or in some cases of Meniere's disease, particularly with a hypermobile footplate of stapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This is distinct from otosclerosis.

## Differential Diagnosis: Serous Otitis Media

In a four-year-old child presenting with bilateral conductive hearing loss, the diagnosis would likely be serous otitis media, contrasting with otosclerosis which is typically seen in middle-aged females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

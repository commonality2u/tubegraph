Grand Tests (GTs) play a crucial role in self-assessment and refining exam preparation strategy. Dr. Phillip, who achieved an impressive Rank 6 in the INI CET May 2025, heavily utilized GTs to track his progress and identify areas for improvement, particularly given his limited preparation time of five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Initial GT Performance and Progression

Dr. Phillip began taking GTs after completing approximately six to eight subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. His initial scores were around 130-135, with a corresponding rank of 8,000-9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This marked a significant improvement by his final GT, where he achieved 170 correct questions and a rank of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, building his confidence for the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Frequency and Review Strategy

Initially, Dr. Phillip took GTs once every 10 to 12 days, increasing the frequency to once a week closer to the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He emphasized the importance of [[role_of_reviewing_grand_test_gt_performances_in_preparation | reviewing GTs]] either on the same day or the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. His review pattern focused on specific question types:
*   First, reviewing questions he had skipped, as he had no idea about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Next, reviewing questions he answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Finally, reviewing questions he got correct by eliminating other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
He noted that due to time constraints, he did not review questions he was very sure about or their respective topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Utilizing GT Analytics for Improvement

Dr. Phillip confirmed that [[utilizing_gt_analytics_for_exam_preparation | GT graphs and analytics]] were helpful in tracking his progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. When his scores initially saw a significant rise to 95-96 percentile, he felt hesitant to take another GT, fearing a drop in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. However, he learned that scores would naturally fluctuate, but improvement would continue if the preparation was correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

GTs helped him understand whether his preparation was appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The analytics also highlighted his weak subjects, which he addressed by revising the "bottom five subjects" from the graph before his next GT for a more thorough review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Mindset and Confidence
Dr. Phillip advises students to [[approach_and_mindset_towards_gt_scores_and_exam_strategy | trust in their preparation path]] and continue if they feel they are on the right track, rather than being influenced by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The key is to assess if one is progressing, which GT graphs and analytics can help verify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

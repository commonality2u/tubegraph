Genetic testing is crucial when a strong family history of cancer is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For young patients with a significant family history, a hereditary risk assessment (HRD) panel is typically performed, which includes multiple genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, these panels can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If the focus is on breast and ovarian cancer and only one gene test is affordable, BRCA gene testing is often the choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Key Genes and Associated Syndromes

*   **BRCA (BRCA1 and BRCA2)**: This is the most common gene involved in familial or hereditary breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   **BRCA2** is more commonly linked with prostate cancer, male breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer compared to BRCA1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **P10**: Associated with Cowden Syndrome, which can lead to GI polyps and breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **TP53**: Linked to Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, characterized by multiple cancers throughout the body, including breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **CDH1**: Connected to diffuse gastric cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **STK11**: Associated with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, which also increases the risk of breast cancer and dramatically raises the risk of pancreatic cancer (by 100 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **RET proto-oncogene**: Causes Mucosal Neuromas, a characteristic feature of MEN 2B (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2B) or MEN 3 Syndrome, which includes medullary thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Indications for BRCA Gene Testing

[[genetics_and_gene_testing_methods | Genetic testing methods]] for BRCA are indicated in several scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>:
*   Presence of a deleterious gene in a blood relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Personal history of ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   One or more relatives diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Personal history of bilateral breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   Personal history of triple-negative breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   Personal history of male breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Completing a syllabus entirely before competitive exams is often an unattainable goal for many students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Even experienced individuals may confidently state their syllabus is not fully completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This persistent challenge highlights the importance of strategic preparation over strict syllabus completion.

## Strategies for Dealing with Incomplete Syllabus

Instead of waiting for syllabus completion, which "is Never happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, students are advised to engage in [[Exam preparation strategies and experiences|Grand Tests (GTs)]] (mock exams) as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Key benefits of early GT engagement include:
*   **Understanding the Exam Format** It takes approximately 5 to 10 GTs to grasp the "game" of solving them, especially with section-wise formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Developing Guessing Power** Starting GTs early, even without having covered all subjects, helps develop a "good guessing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Inter-Subject Reasoning** Early practice encourages "thinking differently to get to the right option," utilizing knowledge from other subjects to fill gaps in specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This is crucial as competitive exams, like NEETPG, often include questions where it's not expected for candidates to know every answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This approach aligns with [[Timeline for exam preparation|starting exam preparation early]] and focuses on [[Problemsolving strategies in exams|problem-solving strategies]] and [[Strategies for dealing with tricky exam questions|adaptive thinking]] rather than solely on rote memorization or complete syllabus mastery.

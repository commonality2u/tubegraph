## Key Strategies

*   **Focus on Previous Year Topics (PYTs)**: Questions in NEET PG are frequently derived from PYTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While the exact questions may not be repeated, the underlying topics are highly likely to reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Emphasize MCQ Practice**: [[skills_required_to_succeed_in_neet_pg_exams | MCQ practice]] is crucial for clearing NEET PG exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

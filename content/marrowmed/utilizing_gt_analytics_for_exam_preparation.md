Dr. Fatima, who achieved a score of 246 out of 300 in the FMG exam, emphasized the crucial role of Grand Tests (GTs) and their analytics in her preparation. As a Marrow Plan C user, she strategically leveraged these resources to improve her performance significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Approach to Grand Tests (GTs)

Dr. Fatima participated in the FMG mock tests and regularly took [[effective_utilization_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | GTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. She started taking GTs approximately two to three weeks after commencing her solid preparation in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Her score in the final mock test was around 223 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Initially, her scores in [[improving_gt_scores_over_time | GTs]] ranged from 160 to 170, but over time, they progressed to above 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This marked a remarkable progression from scores in the 170-180 range to her final score of 246 in the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Leveraging GT Analysis for Improvement

Dr. Fatima's strategy for improving her scores involved a systematic review of her GT performance:
*   **Identifying Weak Subjects**: After completing a GT, Marrow provided a list of subjects where she was weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This analysis gave her a clear idea of which areas needed more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Targeted Revision**: She would prioritize studying these weak subjects before taking the next GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Continuous Adjustment**: If a score in a particular subject dipped in a subsequent GT, she recognized it might be due to a lack of revision and would revise those topics again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Utilizing [[role_of_reviewing_grand_test_gt_performances_in_preparation | GT analysis]]**: She consistently used the [[role_of_reviewing_grand_test_gt_performances_in_preparation | GT analysis]] feature to pinpoint her weak subjects and revise them before the next test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Perception of Marrow GTs vs. Actual Exam

While some students found Marrow [[using_grand_tests_gts_to_assess_preparation_level | GTs]] to be on the harder side, Dr. Fatima noted that the actual FMG exam presented a mixed bag of difficulty levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. She found that the first paper of the actual exam was more challenging than the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Crucially, preparing with the [[effective_use_of_question_banks_and_gts | GTs]] helped her learn how to rule out options, which minimized pressure during the actual exam as she was accustomed to the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## General Advice on Grand Tests

Dr. Fatima advises students not to view [[effective_utilization_of_qbank_and_gt_grand_tests | GTs]] as the final exam, but rather as a tool to familiarize themselves with the exam environment and question patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Her experience underscores that consistent analysis and targeted revision based on [[custom_module_and_gt_analysis_for_exam_preparation | GT analysis]] can significantly boost scores over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

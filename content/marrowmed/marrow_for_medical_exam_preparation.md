## [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] for Medical Exam Preparation: Dr. Narendra's Strategy

Dr. Narendra, an MBBS graduate from Nepal and a second-year Radiology resident at AIIMS, successfully cleared both the FMG and INICET exams by strategically utilizing [[Role of Marrow in exam preparation | Marrow]] during his final MBBS years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. His unique approach highlights how a single, comprehensive platform can aid in cracking multiple competitive medical examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Early Engagement with [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]]

Dr. Narendra began using [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow]] in his final year of MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He primarily focused on the four major subjects taught in the final year: Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics & Gynecology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Initially, his goal was to prepare for his final university examinations, not entrance exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He completed most of the videos for these four major subjects, along with Community Medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Benefits of [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow Videos]]: Depth and Integration

Dr. Narendra found the depth and clarity of [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow's regular videos]] to be unbeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He believes that deeper understanding of concepts makes medicine easier, as it helps in retaining information and performing well in MCQ exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | videos]] not only assisted him with theory exams but also with practical examinations during his final years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A key advantage was how [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow]] integrated clinical subjects (Medicine, Surgery, OBG, Pediatrics) with pre and paraclinical subjects like Pharmacology, Pathology, Physiology, Microbiology, and Anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Modern exam questions often integrate various subjects, requiring a holistic understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

> "I think medicine is a very beautiful branch and the more deep we go the more better understanding we have it's actually better for us it makes it more easy and the best thing about Mar is it is unbeatable in that context like it's so indepth..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

### [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | Marrow Question Bank]] (QBank)

After watching videos, Dr. Narendra used the [[Utilization of Marrow question bank for competitive exams | Marrow QBank]] to reinforce his learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. His strategy involved completing a video and then immediately tackling related questions from the QBank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This helped fill any knowledge gaps and identify specific points within the videos that were frequently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The QBank acts as a "net" that highlights important, frequently tested areas of a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Notes Strategy

Dr. Narendra exclusively used [[Marrow as a primary study resource | Marrow's]] printed notes (Edition 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. He found them beautifully integrated with the video lectures, eliminating the need to create his own notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. These notes simplify video content, and ample space is provided for adding extra information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Revision Videos for Short Subjects

For shorter subjects, which were taught earlier in his MBBS curriculum, Dr. Narendra relied on [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow's revision videos]] due to limited preparation time (about 1.5 months) before his INICET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He felt confident enough in his major subjects from his final-year [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow video]] study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He also utilized the revision video notes that were provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Importance of Grand Tests

Grand Tests on [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] were crucial for assessing his level of preparation and identifying areas needing additional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The marks he obtained in [[Role of Marrow platform in medical exam preparation | Marrow]] Grand Tests correlated very closely (within +/- 3-4 marks) with his actual INICET exam score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The analytics provided by Grand Tests helped him identify his weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For instance, a Grand Test before his preparation revealed his major subjects were strong, but minor subjects were weak due to less exposure during internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This insight led him to focus on short subjects using [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | revision videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Advice for FMG Exam Preparation

Dr. Narendra believes that the best preparation for the FMG exam starts by studying properly throughout MBBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. For those in later stages or facing logistic limitations (like less patient exposure), platforms like [[Utilizing educational apps like Marrow for medical studies | Marrow]] offer an amazing opportunity to gain comprehensive knowledge from anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of building a strong foundation and understanding basics deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. [[use of Marrow videos for medical education | Marrow videos]] are particularly effective for building this detailed understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Shortcuts are ineffective for achieving high scores and ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

The FMG exam, in Dr. Narendra's experience, tests knowledge as an MBBS graduate and assesses a candidate's minimum standard for practicing medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The questions are clinical and increasingly align with exams like NEET PG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Therefore, in-depth preparation for one exam, utilizing resources like [[Marrow subscription and its impact on exam preparation | Marrow]], ultimately aids in preparing for all medical competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Dr. Narendra's journey highlights that [[Role of Marrow in exam success | Marrow]] serves as a comprehensive resource for medical students, providing in-depth content, targeted practice, and effective assessment tools crucial for excelling in both university and competitive entrance examinations.

This article provides a recall of [[microbiology_mcqs_from_inicet_november_2024 | Microbiology MCQs from INICET November 2024]] questions from the INSA May 2025 examination. Dr. Abdul Nasir (Dr. Blueprint) highlights that approximately 85% to 90% of the questions could be answered directly from the 13-hour microbiology revision videos and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Recalled Questions and Answers

### 1. Satellitism Phenomenon
The phenomenon observed in the given picture is [[microbial_phenomena_and_tests | satellitism]] on blood agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This occurs when *Haemophilus influenzae* grows near a central thick line of *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. *Haemophilus influenzae* shows this property of satellitism, not *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This concept was directly covered in class notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### 2. Immunoglobulin Identification
The antibody shown is a dimer, consisting of two units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. According to revision class notes, all antibodies are monomers, except for IgM which is a pentamer, and secretory IgA which is a dimer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Therefore, the identified immunoglobulin is secretory IgA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### 3. Matching Tests with Organisms
This question required matching specific diagnostic tests with their corresponding organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The matches, as covered in revision notes, are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
*   **Alex test**: For *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Coagulase test**: For *Staphylococcus aureus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **String test**: For *Vibrio cholerae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Quellung's test**: Used to detect the capsule of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
The correct option indicated all matches were already aligned (1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C, 4 is D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### 4. Thermal Dimorphic Fungi
The question asked to identify the exception among thermal dimorphic fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Revision notes list six dimorphic fungi: *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, *Paracoccidioides*, *Sporothrix schenckii*, and *Talaromyces marneffei* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. *Cryptococcus neoformans* is not a dimorphic fungus; it is a yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### 5. Helminths with Auto-infection
Auto-infection is commonly seen in *Taenia solium*, *Hymenolepis nana*, *Enterobius vermicularis*, and *Strongyloides stercoralis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The mnemonic "T.H.E. Strongyloides" helps remember these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Among the options provided, *Strongyloides stercoralis* is considered the most common cause of auto-infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### 6. Protozoa with Two Morphological Forms
Protozoa can have trophozoite and cyst forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Intestinal protozoa** (e.g., *Giardia*) have both trophozoite and cyst forms, seen in stool samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Free-living protozoa** (e.g., *Naegleria*, *Acanthamoeba*) also have both forms, but only trophozoites are typically seen in CSF samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Vaginal protozoa** (*Trichomonas vaginalis*) have only one morphological form: trophozoite (cysts are absent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
Therefore, *Trichomonas vaginalis* is the only one with a single morphological form, while the others listed (*Naegleria*, *Acanthamoeba*, *Giardia*) have two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 7. Kanagawa Phenomenon and Wagatsuma Agar
The Kanagawa phenomenon on Wagatsuma agar is a characteristic feature of *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This organism causes gastroenteritis and wound infections, and it produces green colonies on TCBS agar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### 8. *H. pylori* Infection and Peptic Ulcer Disease
*Helicobacter pylori* infects about half of the global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, not every infected person develops peptic ulcer disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The reason for this variation lies in host factors (genetic predisposition), environmental factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, hygiene), and bacterial virulence factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Other statements, such as *H. pylori* colonizing the gastric antrum or infection being asymptomatic and resolving spontaneously, are either partially true or not the primary reason for varied disease manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### 9. Statements about *Toxoplasma gondii*
Multiple statements were presented regarding *Toxoplasma gondii*, and the incorrect one had to be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Infection is more common in the third trimester for mother-to-baby transmission**: True <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Intermediate hosts are mammals and birds**: True <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **It can be cultured in the peritoneal cavity of mice**: True, as *Toxoplasma* is non-cultivable and requires viral culture methods like animal inoculation (mice peritoneal cavity) or Vero cell culture (tissue culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Oocysts in the stool are infective**: False. Oocysts shed in cat feces are not infective immediately. They require sporulation in the soil to become infective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### 10. True/False Statements about Tests
This question involved evaluating several statements about diagnostic tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Widal test is positive for typhoid in the first week of illness**: False. Antibodies (detected by Widal test) are generally detectable from the second week of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is done for Leptospira**: True <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Weil-Felix test is for typhus fever (Rickettsia)**: True <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Standard agglutination test (SAT) is for Brucella**: True <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Catalase is positive for Streptococcus**: False. Catalase test is positive for *Staphylococcus*, not *Streptococcus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
Thus, statements 1 and 5 are false, while 2, 3, and 4 are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### 11. Perianal Itching in a Child
A 5-year-old with perianal itching, with eggs seen on a perianal swab (scotch tape method), and the eggs described as plano-convex (D-shaped) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This clinical picture and egg morphology are classic for *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### 12. Matching Disease and Vector (Rickettsial Diseases)
This question required matching rickettsial diseases with their respective vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Epidemic typhus**: Louse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Endemic typhus**: Flea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever**: Hard tick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Rickettsialpox**: Mite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
These associations are directly available in the revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

### 13. Stain Not Used for *Aspergillus*
A post-renal transplant patient with pneumonia-like symptoms and low CD4 count shows hyphae with narrow, acute-angle, dichotomous branching in an H&E image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This morphology is characteristic of *Aspergillus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. The question asks which stain is *not* used for this organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) and GMS (Gomori Methenamine Silver)** are common fungal stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Masson Fontana** stain is used for melanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. *Aspergillus niger* and *Aspergillus fumigatus* can produce melanin pigment, making Masson Fontana a possible stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Congo Red** stains amyloid, and while it can slightly stain fungal cell walls, it is generally the least preferred and less effective fungal stain compared to the others mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Therefore, Congo Red is the stain *not* commonly used or preferred for *Aspergillus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

### 14. Complete Clinical Cure of Malaria
The question concerns the drugs responsible for complete clinical cure of malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   For *P. vivax* malaria, **chloroquine** is responsible for clinical cure and transmission cure, while **primaquine** is for radical cure (preventing relapse) and also transmission cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.
*   For *P. falciparum* malaria, **artesunate, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine** (ACTs) are for clinical cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Primaquine is added for transmission cure (killing gametocytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. There is no radical cure needed for *P. falciparum* as there is no relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
Therefore, **primaquine** is primarily involved in radical cure and transmission cure, but not clinical cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

### 15. Painful Genital Vesicular Lesions
A young man presents with painful genital vesicular lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. The image shows multinucleated giant cells (Tzanck cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Vesicular lesions and Tzanck cells are characteristic of herpes virus infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The treatment for herpes is **acyclovir** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

### 16. HPV Strains and Cervical Cancer
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) strains 6 and 11 typically cause anogenital warts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Strains 16 and 18 are the most common causes of cervical cancer, with others like 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 also contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. Thus, **HPV 16 and 18** are most commonly responsible for cervical cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

### 17. Enteroviruses Causing Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is caused by **Coxsackievirus A24 serotype** and **Enterovirus 70** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. This was noted as one of the few questions not explicitly covered in the revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### 18. WHO Recommended Investigation for Spinal Tuberculosis
For spinal tuberculosis, the WHO-recommended investigation of choice, especially when a quick diagnosis is needed, is **CB-NAAT (Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. While culture is the gold standard for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, it is a slow grower (1.5-2 months), making it impractical for rapid diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. Initial steps often include acid-fast staining, followed by CB-NAAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Imaging (X-ray, CT scan) can show deformity but does not provide a definitive etiological diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### 19. Painful Lesions on Palms and Soles with History of Genital Ulcer
A 30-year-old male with painful lesions on palms and soles, following a transient genital lesion a month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This progression describes the stages of syphilis: primary syphilis (genital ulcer/chancre), followed by secondary syphilis (rashes on palms and soles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. Syphilis is caused by *Treponema pallidum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. The most appropriate test for diagnosis is a **serological test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, such as VDRL or RPR, as mentioned in the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

### 20. Chronic Urinary Frequency with Leukocytes but No Bacterial Growth
A 62-year-old male presents with chronic urinary frequency, normal prostate, no suprapubic tenderness, and urine analysis showing leukocytes but no bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This condition, characterized by pus (leukocytes) in the urine without the presence of bacteria on culture, is known as **sterile pyuria** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. It can be caused by organisms like *Rickettsia*, *Chlamydia*, or *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* which are not easily cultured by routine methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### 21. Urethral Discharge with Gram-Negative Diplococci
A 26-year-old male with pus in the urethral meatus (urethral discharge), diagnosed with urethritis, and a history of unprotected sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Gram stain shows gram-negative diplococci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. These findings are classic for gonococcal urethritis, caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (gonococcus), which appears as intracellular gram-negative diplococci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. The treatment of choice is **ceftriaxone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

### 22. Unlikely Cause of Osteomyelitis
A 12-year-old boy presents with pain, swelling, and warmth in the left leg, with elevated ESR/CRP, and X-ray showing clearing bone fragments, indicating osteomyelitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. The most common cause of osteomyelitis in general is *Staphylococcus aureus*, and in sickle cell anemia patients, it's *Salmonella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. In neonates, common causes include Group B *Streptococcus*, *E. coli*, and *Klebsiella* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* can also cause osteomyelitis, especially in endemic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. When comparing common causes, *Klebsiella* is generally considered the least common among the bacterial options listed for osteomyelitis in a 12-year-old boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

### 23. Painful Swallowing and Esophageal White Patches in HIV Patient
A 38-year-old male with HIV and low CD4 count complains of painful swallowing and retrosternal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. Upper GI endoscopy reveals white patches in the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This is a clear description of esophageal candidiasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. *Candida* is a yeast-like fungus that causes white, removable membranes on skin and mucosa, including the esophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Microscopic examination would show **yeast cells and pseudohyphae** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

The recall session emphasized that a significant majority of the questions (20 out of 23) in this [[clinical_vignette_based_mcqs_in_microbiology | Clinical vignette based MCQs in microbiology]] section were directly covered in the 13-hour revision notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a [[parathyroid_localization_and_hyperparathyroidism | parathyroid adenoma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It is characterized by increased serum calcium and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, often accompanied by a mass near the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Indications for Surgery in Asymptomatic Hyperparathyroidism

The latest guidelines for the management of asymptomatic [[parathyroid_localization_and_hyperparathyroidism | hyperparathyroidism]] recommend surgery in the following scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>:

*   **Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>: Less than 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Bone Density** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>: Reduced bone density (osteoporosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. A normal DEXA scan does not rule out the need for surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Creatinine Clearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>: Reduction in creatinine clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Urinary Calcium** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>: More than 400 mg of calcium in a 24-hour urine collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Serum Calcium** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>: Serum calcium level is 1 mg/dL above the normal range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Case Example

A 34-year-old male presents with serum calcium of 12.8 and raised PTH, with a 1.5 x 1.5 cm mass identified below the right lower lobe of the thyroid gland on ultrasonography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Given his age (less than 50) and serum calcium being more than 1 mg/dL above the normal range, surgery is indicated, even if he is asymptomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Investigations and Surgical Approach

Before surgery, the parathyroid gland must be localized, as they are small and can be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

*   **Localization**: A Sestamibi scan is performed, as it is specific for parathyroid tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Surgical Procedure**: Localization is followed by a focused [[parathyroid_localization_and_hyperparathyroidism | parathyroidectomy]], where the affected gland is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Dr. Ravi, who secured Rank 3 in the recently conducted INI exam (and Rank 5 in NEET PG), emphasizes the crucial role of consistent and planned revision for success in medical entrance examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite having secured a high rank in NEET PG, he gave the INI exam without pressure, having already achieved his dream of securing a medicine seat in a central institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His unplanned success in the INI exam highlights the strong foundational concepts and consistent efforts he had put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## The Marrow Journey: Early Preparation and Syllabus Completion

Dr. Ravi began his PG preparation in his third year of MBBS, subscribing to Marrow Plan C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. His initial approach was not intensely serious; he focused on covering third-year subjects and parts of final-year subjects as advised by seniors and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

By his final year, he became more serious, integrating MCQ practice with topics he read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He completed all his final year syllabus using Marrow videos, specifically to avoid the burden during internship when time would be scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This proactive approach ensured he had notes ready for revision during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He used a mix of self-made and Marrow PDF notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Evolving MCQ Practice and Review

Dr. Ravi performed most of his MCQ practice in his final year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. On the first day of his internship, he reset all his completed Marrow modules to zero and started re-solving them, this time including first and second-year subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. By the end of his internship, he had completed approximately 80% of all MCQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

He noted a significant difference in solving MCQs between his pre-final/final year and internship:
*   **Pre-final/Final Year**: He dedicated more time to reading full explanations and noting down details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Internship**: Due to time constraints, he was more selective, focusing on revising from his notes rather than reading all explanations if an MCQ was answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

To maintain consistency during a demanding internship at UCMS, he set a daily challenge of solving at least four to five modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His strategy involved:
*   Reading a topic.
*   Immediately solving the corresponding module on Marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

This approach provided two benefits:
1.  **Comprehensive Review**: Solving MCQs after reading a topic led to a thorough review and deeper understanding of how questions could be framed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
2.  **Memory Retention**: It "hammered the topic" into his brain, making it harder to forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Strategic Grand Test (GT) Analysis

Dr. Ravi started taking [[importance_of_revision_and_grand_tests|Grand Tests]] in his first month of internship, with a frequency of one GT every two to three weeks, adjusting based on his internship postings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

His GT analysis strategy involved reviewing questions using filters:
1.  **Incorrect questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Skipped questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
3.  **Guessed questions that turned out correct** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

He prioritized understanding the defects in his concepts, especially for guessed answers where he lacked full understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. He would dedicate three to four hours to reviewing these specific types of questions, only looking at correctly answered questions if he had extra time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This immediate review on the same day was key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Tackling Stagnation in GT Scores
Dr. Ravi experienced phases where his GT scores stagnated, initially at 150 correct questions and later at 165 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. He realized this stagnation was due to postponing "weak subjects" like Community Medicine and FMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. To overcome this, he intentionally focused on these subjects, using the subject-wise review feature in the Marrow app to identify frequently asked topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This proactive approach to facing "demons" (weak subjects) is crucial for improving scores and ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## The "20th Notebook" for Focused Revision

A cornerstone of Dr. Ravi's [[effective_revision_techniques_for_medical_exams|effective revision strategy]] was his "20th notebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. He planned his revision from the very first day of his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   He kept his main notes aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   He used a separate notebook to write down factual information or concepts he anticipated forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   He consciously excluded common sense information he already remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

This meticulous process resulted in extremely concise notes; for example, surgery subjects were condensed into about 60 pages, allowing him to revise surgery in just 8 to 9 hours before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This enabled him to revise the entire 19-subject syllabus three to four times in the last three months before NEET PG, taking only 20 to 25 days per revision cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Managing Bookmarked MCQs
To reduce bookmarked MCQs, he would re-solve them without looking at the answer. If he got it right, he'd remove the bookmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For purely factual questions or those unlikely to appear in the exam, he'd write down the fact in his 20th notebook to revise only a week before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Utilizing Marrow Pearls for On-the-Go Revision

Marrow Pearls proved highly beneficial, especially during his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. During periods of downtime in emergency rooms or wards, he would use the Marrow app to choose a subject and solve pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This served as effective revision and highlighted important concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Dr. Ravi's Parting Wisdom: The Paramountcy of Revision

> "For the PG entrance examination I always say there is only the [[importance_of_revision_for_neetpg_and_ini_exams|revision]] that matters in the final examination so how much you like in the depth you study one subject that doesn't matter in final exam it's finally the how much times you have revised that subject because medicine is all factual like more than 80% is factual subjects so you have to like just click the answer in that uh like that high period in the examination stress so you have to revise more and more and you have to plan your [[importance_of_consistency_in_exam_preparation|revision]] from the day one of your preparation you cannot study your all 19 year 19 subject main notes like one month before the examination so you have to make your own notes or pre-made notes whatever suits you and [[importance_of_revision_and_grand_tests|GTS]] GTs are literally Irreplaceable like in your preparation if you are not giving GT might be you are not g you are not going in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>

Dr. Ravi's final advice emphasizes that while in-depth study is important, the number of times a subject is revised is paramount for final exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Since medical exams are largely factual, constant revision is essential for quick recall under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. He strongly advises starting [[effective_revision_tactics_for_medical_exams|revision planning]] from day one of preparation and consistently taking [[importance_of_exams_for_medical_students|Grand Tests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. He advises to first read the main subjects, then filter the information, rather than immediately jumping to rapid revision videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

Infections of the tonsil can be caused by various pathogens, leading to different clinical presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Causes of Tonsil Infection
Tonsil infections can be either [[Parasitic and viral diseases | viral]] or [[Fungal and bacterial infections | bacterial]] in origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If the infection is [[Bacterial Infections and Eological Agents | bacterial]], the most common causative organism is Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Types of Tonsil Infection Presentation
Tonsil infections typically present in four main types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:

### Serous Type (Acute Serous Tonsillitis)
This type involves a diffuse inflammation of the tonsil along with the rest of the pharynx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Follicular Variant
In this presentation, pus or exudates are found within the tonsil crypts, appearing as distinct spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Membranous or Pseudomembranous Variant
The pus from the follicular variant can fuse to form a membrane, specifically a pseudomembrane, over the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Parenchymatous Tonsillitis
When the infection penetrates the parenchyma of the tonsil, it can lead to chronic enlargement, making the tonsils very large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Patients with this variant often present with [[Symptoms of respiratory infections | obstructive symptoms]] like sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Differential Diagnoses for Membranous Tonsil
If a patient presents with a membrane over the tonsil and does not respond to antibiotics targeting Group A beta hemolytic strep, other conditions should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The differential diagnoses (DDs) for a membrane over the tonsil can be remembered by the mnemonic "VIT D" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>:

### Vincent's Angina (V)
Also known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or trench mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It is caused by *Borrelia vincentii* and *Fusobacterium fusiforme*, an anaerobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Treatment requires anaerobic coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Infectious Mononucleosis (I)
This is a [[Parasitic and viral diseases | viral]] infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Patients typically exhibit significant lymphadenopathy, especially cervical lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Diagnosis is made by the Paul-Bunnell test or Monospot test, which detect heterophile antibodies, and by observing atypical lymphocytosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Diphtheria (D)
Diphtheria should be suspected if there is no history of immunization against the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The characteristic features of the membrane are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
*   Dirty gray appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Extension beyond the tonsil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   Tight adherence, causing bleeding upon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

If these features are observed, a throat swab should be taken for microscopy to look for club-shaped Gram-positive rods, indicative of *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Treatment involves immediate administration of antitoxin, after sensitivity testing, which targets the exotoxin released by the [[Fungal and bacterial infections | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Antibiotics like beta-lactams or macrolides are also given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Diphtheria is a fatal condition, with fatalities resulting from respiratory obstruction due to membrane dislodgment, or late complications such as myocarditis, arrhythmias (heart complications), and peripheral neuritis leading to palatal palsy (nerve complications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Tonsillectomy for Infections
While most tonsillitis cases are managed with antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, [[indications_for_tonsilectomy | tonsillectomy]] is considered in cases of recurrent infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:
*   More than three episodes per year for three consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   More than five episodes per year for two consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   More than seven episodes in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

[[indications_for_tonsilectomy | Tonsillectomy]] is also indicated when the tonsil is massively enlarged due to [[Symptoms of respiratory infections | obstructive symptoms]] like sleep apnea, typically in the parenchymatous variant of tonsillitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

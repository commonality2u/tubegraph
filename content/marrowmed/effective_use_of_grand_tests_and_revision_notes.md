Dr. Narendra, an MBBS graduate from Nepal and a second-year Radiology resident, shared his unique approach to preparing for multiple competitive exams, including the FMG exam and INICET, highlighting the crucial roles of [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] and revision materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Grand Tests

[[Importance of revision and grand tests | Grand tests]] are considered highly useful for gauging one's level of preparation and identifying areas needing additional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Dr. Narendra noted that the scores he achieved in Marrow's [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] closely correlated with his actual INICET exam marks, with a mere +/- 3-4 mark difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

> "The only [[Importance of revision and grand tests | Grand test]] which resembles with your actually understanding is like the [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | Grand test]] because during my in exam I gave a few [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand test]] but the actual mark that I got during my n exam correlated exactly like I would say it was plus-minus 3 4 marks that is what it resembled to that extent." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

### Identifying Weaknesses
The analytics provided by [[Role of grand tests and question banks in exam preparation | grand tests]] are instrumental in pinpointing weak and strong subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Dr. Narendra realized his major subjects were strong enough for the exam, but his minor subjects were weak, a crucial insight gained from a [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand test]] he took early in his preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This discovery led him to focus on preparing short subjects from [[Approaches to effective notetaking and revision techniques | revision videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Without taking these tests, he would not have been aware of his weak areas, potentially impacting his scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Revision Notes and Videos

### Printed Notes
Dr. Narendra preferred using printed notes rather than making his own, as he found Marrow's printed notes to be very good and beautifully integrated with the video lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He noted that the notes simplified complex information from the videos, and ample space was provided for adding any extra information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Revision Videos for Short Subjects
For short subjects, Dr. Narendra primarily used [[Approaches to effective notetaking and revision techniques | revision videos]], especially before his INICET exam, due to limited preparation time (about 1.5 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He paired these [[Approaches to effective notetaking and revision techniques | revision videos]] with their corresponding [[Approaches to effective notetaking and revision techniques | revision video notes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. He was confident in his knowledge of major subjects from his final MBBS years, allowing him to focus his limited time on improving weaker areas identified by [[Utilizing grand tests and custom modules for exam readiness | grand tests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

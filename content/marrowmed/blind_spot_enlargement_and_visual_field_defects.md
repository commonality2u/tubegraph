Visual field defects are abnormalities in the field of vision, which is the entire area an individual can see without moving their head or eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Perimetry is the method used to examine these visual fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. When interpreting perimetry printouts, the left side of the printout corresponds to the left eye's field of vision, and the right side to the right eye's field of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The central point in a visual field diagram represents the fovea, which is the point of fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

## Types of Visual Field Defects

### Blind Spot Enlargement

The physiological blind spot is a normal area of vision loss corresponding to the optic disc, where there are no photoreceptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. An enlargement of the blind spot occurs when this area appears larger than normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

**Causes:**
*   **Papilledema:** Swelling of the optic disc due to raised intracranial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, which can lead to blind spot enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Congenital optic nerve lesions:** Various congenital conditions affecting the optic nerve can also present with an enlarged blind spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

### Arcuate Scotoma

An arcuate scotoma is a visual field defect characterized by an arc shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. It typically affects the superior or inferior arcuate nerve fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. A key distinguishing feature is that central vision remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Altitudinal Defect

An altitudinal defect affects either the entire superior or inferior half of the visual field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. An example is superior hemianopia, where the superior visual field is lost while the inferior field remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Unlike arcuate scotoma, the central vision can be affected in an altitudinal defect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

### Roenne's Nasal Step

Roenne's nasal step occurs due to unequal contractions between the superior and inferior hemispheres of the visual field, forming a step-like defect on the nasal side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### Homonymous Hemianopia

Homonymous hemianopia is a condition where vision is lost in the same half of the visual field in both eyes (e.g., right-sided loss in both eyes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

**Causes:**
This defect occurs due to a lesion located below the optic chiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Specific locations of lesions that can cause homonymous hemianopia include:
*   Optic tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a> (e.g., due to meningitis like tubercular or syphilitic, or posterior cerebral artery aneurysm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   Lateral geniculate body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.
*   Optic radiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   Visual cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.

### Bitemporal Hemianopia

Bitemporal hemianopia is a specific visual field defect where vision is lost in the temporal (outer) half of the visual field of both eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.

**Causes:**
The most common cause is a pituitary adenoma, especially a macroadenoma (greater than 1 cm in size), which compresses the optic chiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. Other causes include:
*   Third ventricular glioma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>
*   Craniopharyngioma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>
*   Anterior cerebral or anterior communicating artery aneurysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>
*   Cavernous sinus thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>

### Complete Blindness

Complete blindness implies a severe loss of vision in both eyes. [[CNS imaging signs related to various conditions|Bilateral cortical blindness]] means the visual cortices have completely stopped functioning, usually seen in cases of very severe trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

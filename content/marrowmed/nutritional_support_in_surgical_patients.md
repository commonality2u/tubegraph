## Nutritional Support in Surgical Patients

Nutritional support is a crucial aspect of patient care, both before and after surgery, to ensure better outcomes and facilitate recovery.

### Pre-operative Nutritional Improvement
Improving nutrient intake, especially if done for at least two weeks prior to surgery, can significantly benefit post-surgical outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>. Patients with chronic anemia tend to tolerate it better than acute blood loss because the body has adapted to the lower hemoglobin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

### Post-operative Care and Fluid Management
As part of [[enhanced_recovery_after_surgery_protocols | Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols]], patients are encouraged to receive a regular diet post-operatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:19">[03:36:19]</a>. Intravenous (IV) fluids are typically discontinued within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:35">[03:38:35]</a>.

### Enteral Nutrition
Enteral nutrition involves delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
*   **Methods**
    *   **RI tube (Nasogastric tube) feeding:** Used for a period of two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:05">[05:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>. The length of an NG tube is measured from the tip of the nose to the earlobule, then to the xiphoid sternum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>. Ideally, it should be inserted in a sitting position with the neck slightly flexed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:50">[05:49:50]</a>.
    *   **Gastrostomy:** An opening made in the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) involves inserting an endoscope into the stomach, feeling for the light, puncturing, and inserting the tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Jejunostomy:** An opening made in the jejunum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:07">[05:57:07]</a>.
*   **Complications of Enteral Nutrition**
    *   Tube-related complications are the most common, such as blockade and displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:04">[05:43:04]</a>.
    *   Other complications include osmotic diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:04">[05:43:04]</a>, aspiration pneumonitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:04">[05:43:04]</a>, overfeeding, and hyperglycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:04">[05:43:04]</a>.
    *   Hypoglycemia is an unlikely complication of RI tube feeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:08">[05:40:08]</a>.

### Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)
TPN is the administration of nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the GI tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:07">[05:45:07]</a>.
*   **Vein Selection for TPN**
    *   For TPN, the subclavian vein is commonly chosen due to the lowest risk of infection and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:18">[05:58:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:10">[05:59:10]</a>.
    *   The femoral vein has the maximum risk of infection and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:18">[05:58:18]</a>.
    *   The internal jugular vein (IGV) is most commonly used for central lines due to ease of insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.
*   **Monitoring TPN Patients**
    *   Weight should be measured daily; increased weight gain is an early sign of overfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:05">[05:55:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>.
    *   Serum electrolytes should be measured daily until the patient is stable, then can be reduced to weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   [[Vitamin deficiencies in clinical settings | Vitamin levels]] should be checked weekly to fortnightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:40">[06:01:40]</a>.
    *   Daily pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and fluid balance should also be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>.
*   **Complications of TPN**
    *   Central line-related sepsis is the most common serious [[complications_related_to_surgery_and_postoperative_care | complication]] of TPN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:07">[06:10:07]</a>.
    *   Other complications include hyperglycemia, weight gain, and cholestasis (increased bilirubin and LFTs, requiring TPN cessation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
    *   [[Vitamin deficiencies in clinical settings | Micronutrient deficiencies]], such as zinc, can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:14">[06:14:14]</a>.
    *   Long-term TPN use can lead to liver dysfunction, necessitating the use of lipid-free solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:30">[06:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:29">[06:18:29]</a>.

### Refeeding Syndrome
Refeeding syndrome occurs when chronically malnourished patients are given nutrition too quickly, leading to electrolyte abnormalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:16">[01:57:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:30">[06:15:30]</a>.
*   **Key Features**
    *   Hypophosphatemia is the primary driving electrolyte abnormality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:16">[05:57:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:02">[06:01:02]</a>. Other electrolyte abnormalities can include hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:40">[06:02:40]</a>.
    *   Thiamine supplementation and gradual nutritional build-up can reduce the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:14">[06:04:14]</a>.
    *   Patients with a BMI less than 16 are at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:50">[06:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>.
    *   Unintentional weight loss of over 15% in the last 3-6 months, or little to no nutritional intake for more than 10 days, also increases risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>.
    *   Low potassium, phosphate, or magnesium levels prior to starting feeds are risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>.
*   **Cause of Death**
    *   Arrhythmias and congestive heart failure are the leading causes of death in refeeding syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:02">[06:10:02]</a>.

### Nutritional Regime in End-Stage Renal Disease
For patients with end-stage renal disease, a low-volume, high-calorie nutritional regime is preferred to avoid fluid overload on the kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:16">[05:59:16]</a>.

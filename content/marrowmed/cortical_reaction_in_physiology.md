The National Post Graduate (N PG) exam often features highly conceptual questions in physiology, with many stemming from familiar areas, though some, like the one on polyspermy and the cortical reaction, are brand new [00:00:19]-[00:00:27], [00:01:15]-[00:01:21]. These novel questions have a high probability of being repeated in future exams, making their understanding crucial [00:01:56]-[00:01:58].

## Cortical Reaction Explained

The cortical reaction is a critical process that occurs in the zona pellucida of an oocyte immediately after fertilization [00:01:24]-[00:01:28]. Its primary purpose is to prevent polyspermy, ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the egg [00:01:10]-[00:01:13], [00:04:02]-[00:04:06].

### Mechanism of the Cortical Reaction

1.  **Cortical Granules**: The egg cytoplasm contains enzyme-filled vesicles known as cortical granules [00:02:14]-[00:02:26], [00:02:45]-[00:02:50].
2.  **Calcium Influx Trigger**: For the contents of these cortical granules to be released, an increase in intracellular [[Calcium metabolism and its significance in exams | calcium]] is necessary [00:02:54]-[00:03:09]. This rise in intracellular [[Calcium metabolism and its significance in exams | calcium]] occurs immediately after the first sperm enters the egg [00:03:49]-[00:03:52].
3.  **Exocytosis**: The cortical granules fuse with the oocyte membrane, releasing their contents through exocytosis [00:02:30]-[00:02:39], [00:03:13]-[00:03:16].
4.  **Zona Pellucida Modification**: The released hydrolytic enzymes modify the zona pellucida protein, specifically converting ZP2 into ZPF [00:03:19]-[00:03:30], [00:03:55]-[00:04:02], [00:04:55]-[00:04:57].
5.  **Formation of a Tight Barrier**: The resulting ZPF forms a tight barrier that physically prevents further sperm from entering the egg, thus blocking polyspermy [00:03:38]-[00:03:46], [00:04:27]-[00:04:36].

The process does not involve the acrosomal reaction or changes in the oocyte's membrane potential [00:01:30]-[00:01:47]. The entire sequence of these events, driven by the release of cortical granules, is termed the cortical reaction [00:04:10]-[00:04:14].

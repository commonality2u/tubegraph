The tongue's dorsum is anatomically divided into an anterior two-thirds and a base, which includes the posterior one-third and the posterior-most part [00:06:34]. The [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | sulcus terminalis]] is a groove that divides the tongue into its anterior two-thirds and base [00:06:47].

### Base of the Tongue
The posterior one-third of the tongue contains lymphatic aggregations known as the [[anatomy_of_the_tonsils | lingual tonsil]] [00:07:03].

### Anterior Two-Thirds of the Tongue and Papillae
The anterior two-thirds of the tongue does not have lymphatic aggregations but instead features papillae [00:07:12]. Papillae are projections of the lamina propria [00:07:20]. There are four types of papillae found on the tongue [00:07:24]:

*   **Circumvallate Papillae** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
    *   **Location**: Present in front of the [[functional_anatomy_relating_to_cranial_nerves_and_sensory_pathways | sulcus terminalis]] [00:07:36].
    *   **[[Taste receptors and sensation | Taste Buds]]**: Have [[Taste receptors and sensation | taste buds]] [00:07:39].
    *   **Lining Epithelium**: Lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [00:07:53].
    *   **Nerve Supply**: Despite being in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, they are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (ninth nerve), not the facial nerve [00:09:19].

*   **Fungiform Papillae** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
    *   **[[Taste receptors and sensation | Taste Buds]]**: Have [[Taste receptors and sensation | taste buds]] [00:08:01].
    *   **Lining Epithelium**: Lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [00:08:07].

*   **Filiform Papillae** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
    *   **[[Taste receptors and sensation | Taste Buds]]**: [[Taste receptors and sensation | Taste buds]] are absent [00:08:22].
    *   **Lining Epithelium**: Lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [00:08:25].
    *   **Function**: Provide grip for food substances [00:08:36].

*   **Foliate Papillae** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
    *   **[[Taste receptors and sensation | Taste Buds]]**: Have [[Taste receptors and sensation | taste buds]] [00:08:13].
    *   **Lining Epithelium**: Lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [00:08:15].

### Nerve Supply for Sensation and Taste
*   **Anterior Two-Thirds of Tongue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
    *   **General Sensation**: Carried by the lingual nerve [00:08:49].
    *   **Taste Fibers**: Carried by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve [00:08:51].
    *   All papillae in this region (except circumvallate) are supplied by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve [00:09:08].

*   **Posterior One-Third of Tongue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
    *   **General Sensation and Taste Sensation**: Both are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve [00:08:57].

*   **Posterior-Most Part of Tongue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
    *   **Nerve Supply**: Vagus nerve [00:09:05].

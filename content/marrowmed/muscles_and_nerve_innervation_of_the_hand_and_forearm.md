## Muscles and Nerve Innervation of the Hand and Forearm

The innervation of the hand and forearm muscles is complex, with several key nerves contributing to both motor function and sensation. Understanding these pathways is crucial for diagnosing nerve injuries.

### Median Nerve and Its Innervation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07">[17:07]</a>

The median nerve plays a significant role in the motor and sensory innervation of the hand and forearm.

*   **Sensory Supply**: The median nerve carries sensory fibers from the lateral three and a half fingers on the palmar side of the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12">[18:12]</a>.
*   **Motor Supply**:
    *   **Thenar Eminence Muscles**: The median nerve supplies the muscles of the thenar eminence, which are responsible for thumb movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41">[18:41]</a>. These include:
        *   Flexor pollicis brevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51">[18:51]</a>
        *   Abductor pollicis brevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57">[18:57]</a>
        *   Opponens pollicis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01">[19:01]</a>
    *   Among these, the abductor pollicis brevis is consistently supplied by the median nerve, unlike the flexor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis, which can also receive innervation from the ulnar nerve (making them "hybrid muscles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12">[26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16">[26:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37">[26:37]</a>.
    *   **Lumbricals**: The median nerve also supplies the first and second lumbrical muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16">[19:16]</a>.
    *   **Mnemonic**: The muscles consistently supplied by the median nerve in the palm can be remembered with the mnemonic "LOAF": Lumbrical 1 and 2, Opponens pollicis, Abductor pollicis brevis, Flexor pollicis brevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20">[19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20">[25:20]</a>.

#### Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49">[20:49]</a>

The anterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the median nerve, typically branching in the forearm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51">[20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01">[21:01]</a>.
It supplies muscles in the deep forearm compartment:
*   Flexor pollicis longus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36">[20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04">[24:04]</a>
*   Pronator quadratus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08">[24:08]</a>
*   Lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09">[23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10">[24:10]</a>

#### Clinical Implications of Median Nerve Injury

*   **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**: Compression of the median nerve below the transverse carpal ligament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49">[19:49]</a>. Symptoms include loss of sensation in the lateral three and a half fingers on the palmar side and thenar eminence atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16">[20:16]</a>. However, the flexor pollicis longus muscle remains normal, allowing movement of the distal phalanx of the thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26">[20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16">[21:16]</a>.
*   **High Median Nerve Injury**: This occurs when the median nerve is affected higher up, often impacting the anterior interosseous nerve branch.
    *   **Abnormal "O" Sign**: An inability to form a perfect "O" sign with the thumb and index finger (where the tips don't touch, but flatten) is a key indicator of anterior interosseous nerve involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25">[22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03">[23:03]</a>. This is due to paralysis of the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus (index finger part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09">[23:09]</a>.

### Ulnar Nerve Innervation

*   **FDP**: The ulnar nerve supplies the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19">[24:19]</a>.
*   **Flexor Carpi Ulnaris**: This muscle is supplied by the ulnar nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22">[24:22]</a>.
*   **Palmer Interosseous Muscles**: These muscles are supplied by the ulnar nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35">[25:35]</a>.
*   Some thenar muscles (flexor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis) can also receive innervation from the ulnar nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01">[26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05">[26:05]</a>.

### Pectoral Nerves

The pectoral muscles in the chest region are important for shoulder and arm movement, with innervation from the pectoral nerves. This falls under the broader topic of [[muscle_and_nerve_anatomy]].

*   **Pectoralis Major and Minor**: Both muscles are supplied by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54">[27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13">[28:13]</a>.
*   **Medial Pectoral Nerve**: Pierces the pectoralis minor muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18">[28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20">[28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45">[28:45]</a>.
*   **Lateral Pectoral Nerve**: Pierces the clavipectoral fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28">[28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36">[28:36]</a>.
*   **Structures Piercing Clavipectoral Fascia**: In addition to the lateral pectoral nerve, the thoracoacromial artery and cephalic vein also pierce this fascia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57">[28:57]</a>.

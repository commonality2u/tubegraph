Chronic arterial occlusion is characterized by a gradual blockage of an artery, typically due to a thrombus that increases in size over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This gradual nature allows for the development of collateral circulation, supplying areas below the block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In contrast, acute arterial occlusion occurs suddenly, often due to an embolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Clinical Manifestations of Chronic Arterial Occlusion

Patients with chronic arterial occlusion often present with [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | intermittent claudication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | Intermittent Claudication]]

[[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | Intermittent claudication]] is a cramping pain felt after walking a certain distance, known as the claudication distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This pain typically occurs one level lower than the arterial block because collateral vessels are supplying the area below the obstruction, and the muscles there begin to hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Claudication can progress to rest pain or even gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

It is important to differentiate between:
*   **Vascular claudication:** Pain occurs after walking a certain distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Neurogenic claudication:** Pain varies with posture, relieved by bending forward, and aggravated by standing straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This is often due to lumbar canal stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Osteoarthritis:** Maximum pain is felt on the first step, primarily affecting the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

#### Boyd Classification of Claudication
This classification describes the progression of claudication:
*   **Class I:** Pain on walking, but it reduces as the patient continues to walk, as substance P (pain causative agent) gets washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Class II:** Patient experiences pain on walking but continues to walk despite the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Class III:** Pain forces the patient to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Class IV:** Patient develops rest pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Leriche Syndrome (Aortoiliac Obstruction)
This syndrome is characterized by [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | buttock claudication]], which is an early feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Other features include absent femoral and distal pulses, a bruit over the iliac region, and impotence in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Investigations

### Duplex or Doppler Scan
The investigation of choice for aortoiliac obstruction is a duplex or Doppler scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A duplex scan combines Doppler ultrasound with B-mode ultrasound, providing anatomical information of the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)]]
[[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] is a crucial diagnostic tool. It is calculated as:
`Maximum systolic BP at ankle / Maximum systolic BP in the brachial artery` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Values for the latest edition of Bailey's textbook:
*   **Normal:** 0.9 to 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.9:** Indicates potential [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | intermittent claudication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Less than 0.4:** Suggests [[Intermittent Claudication and Related Pain Conditions | chronic limb-threatening ischemia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

In normal individuals, post-exercise [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] values typically increase due to increased blood flow to the lower limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, in patients with an arterial block, post-exercise [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] values will fall, aiding in diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

An [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] less than 0.5 doubles the likelihood of faster deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A gradually decreasing [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] is a sign of imminent limb loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] also indicates cardiac mortality risk; for every 0.1 decrease below 0.9, cardiac mortality risk increases by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

#### Toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBPI)
In patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]] can be falsely high (more than 1.4) due to calcified vessels, making the vessels rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. In such cases, the toe brachial pressure index is more reliable because digital arteries are rarely affected by sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. A TBPI less than 0.6 in diabetic patients, even with a falsely high [[Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and its Clinical Importance | ABPI]], denotes a significant arterial lesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)
Digital subtraction angiography provides dynamic inflow and imaging information, offering detailed anatomy of the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. It involves injecting dye and carries risks such as bleeding, thrombosis, aneurysm, and renal dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. DSA is typically used when planning an intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Causes of Chronic Arterial Occlusion

The two main causes of chronic arterial occlusion are [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's Disease]] (Thromboangiitis Obliterans) and [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Atherosclerosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's Disease]]
*   **Age/Sex:** Occurs in the third decade of life, with males more commonly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Affected Vessels:** Involves the artery, vein, and nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. It affects small to medium-sized vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Spread:** Distal to proximal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Risk Factor:** Main risk factor is smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Clinical Signs:** Presents with gradual desiccation and a clear line of demarcation, leading to gangrene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Angiography:** Shows "screw collaterals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Diagnosis:** Confirmed by muscle biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Atherosclerosis]]
*   **Age/Sex:** Starts in the fifth decade, with equal incidence in males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Affected Vessels:** Primarily involves only the artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. It starts in large, proximal vessels and then progresses to smaller vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Spread:** Proximal to distal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Risk Factors:** Smoking, Type A personality, alcohol, and hyperlipidemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   [!WARNING] Smoking is a risk factor for both. Do not blindly mark [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's]] based on smoking history alone; consider the patient's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## [[Medical and Surgical Management of Vascular Diseases | Management]]

### [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's Disease]] [[Medical and Surgical Management of Vascular Diseases | Management]]
*   **Smoking Cessation:** Essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Pentoxifylline is an approved medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Amputations:** Conservative amputations of only the involved portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Lumbar Sympathectomy:** Can be performed for rest pain to reduce pain by causing cutaneous vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. It is contraindicated in claudication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. If bilateral lumbar sympathectomy is planned, the L1 ganglion should be saved on at least one side to prevent impotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Bypass Grafting:** Not useful in [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's Disease]] because the distal vessels are already blocked due to the involvement of smaller vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Atherosclerosis]] [[Medical and Surgical Management of Vascular Diseases | Management]]
*   **Angioplasty:** Has become the first-line intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. It involves placing a stent to open the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. It is successful for femoral and below-knee obstructions but less useful in cases like [[Buergers Disease and Atherosclerosis | Buerger's]] where vessel caliber is very narrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Potential complications include failure, hematoma, bleeding, and thrombosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Grafting:** Considered the best overall approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   **Above Inguinal Grafts:** For conditions like Leriche Syndrome (aortoiliac obstruction), an aortobifemoral graft is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The best graft material for this region is Dacron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   **Infrainguinal Grafts:** The best overall graft is the reverse saphenous vein graft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The best synthetic graft material is PTFE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. When harvesting the great saphenous vein for a reverse saphenous vein graft, the [[Arterial and nerve supply of the leg | saphenous nerve]] can be injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Dr. Kriti Singh, who achieved an impressive score of 248 in the FMG exam of January 2025, utilized various digital tools and question banks as a core part of her preparation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Marrow as a Primary Source
Dr. Singh identified Marrow as her primary source of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. She subscribed to Marrow in 2021, during her fourth year of medical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. From that point, she consistently used Marrow's resources, including watching main videos, solving [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Q Banks]], and taking Grand Tests (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Early Preparation & Resource Utilization
Dr. Singh began her preparation by focusing on foundational subjects like Pathology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Despite a hectic university schedule involving classes, postings, and assignments, she managed to watch Marrow videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. She primarily utilized her Saturdays and Sundays, which were off days, to make her study academically productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. During weekdays, she aimed to watch two or three videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Initially, Dr. Singh created handwritten notes for all subjects, including OBG, which amounted to around 1000 pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. In her sixth year, she transitioned to using digital notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Her initial focus was on building strong concepts through videos and revising notes, rather than solving MCQs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. She started actively solving [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Q Banks]] in her sixth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

## [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | QBank]] and Grand Test Strategy
Dr. Singh completed all 19 subjects using Marrow's main videos before arriving in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. For subjects like OBGY and Surgery, she watched the main videos twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

After arriving in India in August, her strategy shifted to watching revision videos and simultaneously solving [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Q Banks]] from August to October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. She explicitly stated that the [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | QBank]] is "gold standard" and that solving Marrow [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Q Banks]] and Marrow GTs can enable easy exam cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. She solved a total of 597 Marrow [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | QBank]] modules, focusing on major subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. These modules were the NEET PG modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

Dr. Singh began taking Grand Tests (GTs) from August 7th, taking one every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Her initial GT score was 186 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. From October onwards, her scores consistently remained above 200, reaching 243 in her mock exam, which was reflective of her final score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. She took between 20 to 24 GTs before the actual exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

Her GT review strategy involved maintaining a "GT notebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. In this notebook, she would jot down topics from questions she answered incorrectly. She would then review these specific topics from her main notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. For silly mistakes, she would just read the explanation provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This method allowed her to focus on and strengthen her weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

## Revision and Last-Minute Preparation
From November, Dr. Singh began a concentrated revision phase, planning around four revisions before the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. In the last two months of her preparation, she did not solve any new MCQs or [[Effective use of Q banks and test series | Q Banks]], instead focusing primarily on revisions and GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

In the final 10 days before the exam, she focused solely on her GT notebook, reviewing topics she had frequently gotten wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. Instead of solving previous year NEET/INICET questions directly, she watched Marrow's recall videos. She found these videos highly beneficial as faculties not only provided answers but also reviewed the entire topic, aiding in both question solving and concept clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. She also used Marrow Pearls, particularly while traveling, to quickly review topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Juniors
Dr. Singh emphasizes two critical pieces of advice for juniors:
1.  **Start Early**: She notes a common misconception among students that they can delay preparation until they return to India. However, the FMG exam is evolving, becoming more clinical and concept-based, requiring a strong conceptual foundation that cannot be built in just a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Be Consistent**: Consistency is crucial for success in any exam, including FMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.

She highlights that the FMG exam now features integrated questions that demand clear concepts, moving away from rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. Therefore, understanding concepts is the absolute key to clearing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.

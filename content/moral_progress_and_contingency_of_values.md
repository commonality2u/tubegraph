Moral progress and the contingency of values are topics that draw significant interest in philosophical and ethical discussions. In a recent discussion with William McCaskill, a prominent figure in the [[effective_altruism_movement | effective altruism movement]], these themes were explored extensively, revealing deep insights into how moral values can shift over time and how those shifts aren't as straightforward as one might think.

## Understanding Moral Contingency

The notion that moral values are contingent implies that they are not fixed and can evolve due to various socio-historical factors. McCaskill argues that we might currently be living with a set of moral values that are not necessarily the best possible ones, but rather the ones that happened to win out in our specific historical context. He illustrates this by suggesting that if pivotal historical developments, like the Industrial Revolution, had occurred elsewhere (e.g., in India rather than Western Europe), our predominant values could be markedly different and might exclude practices such as factory farming, which he sees as a moral atrocity (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>).

## The Impermanence of Modern Values

McCaskill posits that modern Western values should not be viewed as the pinnacle of moral progress. Instead, he suggests that we are far from the moral truth and should not hastily lock-in these contemporary values without extensive reflection and debate (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>). He invites societies to imagine an ongoing "long reflection" period wherein reason and empathy shape our moral standards before any drastic actions are taken that might solidify the current moral landscape (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>).

## Historical Examples and Predictions

Historical precedents, such as how societal norms have shifted post-major events like wars or technological revolutions, provide evidence for the contingency of moral values. McCaskill points out that if Nazi Germany had won World War II, societal views toward moral progress would have been drastically different, possibly celebrating outcomes that today are considered moral failings (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>).

Further, McCaskill discusses how [[effective_altruism_and_longterm_impacts | effective altruism itself reflects contingent success]], emphasizing how similar moral ideas had struggled to gain traction in previous eras (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>). This highlights the unpredictable nature of which values gain permanence and influence over time.

## The Role of Moral Progress in the Long Reflection

The concept of "long reflection" is central to McCaskill's strategy for achieving moral progress. He suggests that society should embark on a period of thorough inquiry and introspection, where diverse moral viewpoints can be weighed and balanced through reasoned discourse. The goal is to guide future values by what is actually morally right rather than what is merely convenient or victorious across cultural and historical happenstance (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>).

McCaskill's view is not that we can or should avoid moral progress but rather that we should be cautious and deliberate in shaping the values that future generations will inherit. This approach underscores a belief in the moral responsibility of current generations to ensure ethical improvements continue to evolve rather than stagnate or regress.

> [!info] Conclusion
> 
> McCaskill's exploration of moral progress and the contingency of values emphasizes the fluidity of ethics over time and the responsibility to carefully navigate this moral landscape. By engaging deeply with these concepts, he encourages us to strive not for immediate lock-in of today's values but for an enduring conversation about what is ethically best for future generations.

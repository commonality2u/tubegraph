This article summarizes key points from an interview with Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," focusing on the development, implications, and historical context of nuclear weapons.

## J. Robert Oppenheimer

### Cinematic Depiction and Persona
A new movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer was a contemporary point of discussion. Rhodes noted the filmmakers' accuracy in depicting items like the Trinity test device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The actor playing Oppenheimer, previously seen in "Peaky Blinders," bears a strong physical resemblance to him, capturing his tall, rail-thin physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Oppenheimer was about six feet tall but never weighed more than 140 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Rhodes emphasized that the full story of the Manhattan Project is too vast for a single film, suggesting a multi-part series would be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Communist Sympathies and Espionage
Oppenheimer had been a communist sympathizer in the 1930s, primarily motivated by practical efforts to help Jews escape Nazi Germany, rather than ideological conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Jean Tatlock, a significant romantic partner, was a Communist Party member involved in similar efforts and likely encouraged his attendance at meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, Rhodes asserts there is no possibility Oppenheimer shared information with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Oppenheimer reportedly read Marx on a train trip and found it illogical and "a bunch of hooey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Born into considerable wealth, Oppenheimer initially "lived in his head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> until his experiences at Berkeley, where he saw students living in poverty, awakened his social conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. His brother, Frank Oppenheimer, and Frank's wife were party members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Rhodes believes J. Robert Oppenheimer's misleading statements to security officials during WWII were primarily to protect his brother from repercussions, not because Frank was involved in espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Development of the Atomic Bomb

### Inevitability and Urgency
Rhodes believes the atomic bomb's development was "essentially inevitable," though perhaps not on such an accelerated timeline without World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The primary driver for the wartime urgency was the fear that Nazi Germany, where nuclear fission was discovered in Berlin in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, was already working on a bomb. The Allies lacked effective technological surveillance and human intelligence on the German program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Scientific Breakthroughs
#### Nuclear Fission
The discovery of nuclear fission was startling. A slow, room-temperature neutron could cause a uranium-235 nucleus to split with a massive energy release, likened by Isidore Rabi to "the moon struck the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This reaction was "fiercely exothermic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
Niels Bohr visualized the uranium nucleus as an unstable "liquid drop" or a "water-filled balloon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. A neutron striking this wobbly nucleus could cause it to elongate into a dumbbell shape and then split, releasing significant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
The German chemists who first observed fission were baffled by the presence of lighter elements in their irradiated uranium solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Lise Meitner, an Austrian Jewish physicist who had fled Germany, and her nephew Otto Frisch, correctly interpreted these results by applying Bohr's model, leading to the understanding of nuclear fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
The news of fission was not initially secret; it was published in scientific journals and major newspapers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Many physicists realized they could have performed the experiment with existing lab equipment. Louis Alvarez, upon reading the news, rushed to his lab and replicated it, lamenting he was "two days too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Niels Bohr famously remarked, "What fools we've all been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

#### Chain Reaction and Critical Mass
Scientists quickly realized the potential for a chain reaction: the fission of one atom could release neutrons that would cause other atoms to fission, leading to an exponential increase in energy (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Modern bombs achieve city-busting explosions in about 80 generations of this chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
The Germans, fortunately, never correctly figured out the amount of material needed (critical mass) for a bomb, focusing instead on reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. A sketch by Werner Heisenberg, brought by Niels Bohr from Denmark, led Hans Bethe at Los Alamos to quip, "Are the Germans trying to throw a reactor down on us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
Two émigré Jewish physicists in England calculated that only a small amount of pure uranium-235 would be needed for a bomb—initially estimating one pound, later revised to about 125 pounds, the size of a softball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. They also estimated that a factory to produce this material would cost no more than a battleship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### The British Impetus and Early Concepts of Deterrence
The British, already at war and experiencing the Blitz, recognized the urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The 1940 report by the émigré physicists concluded that no physical structure could offer protection against such a bomb, and the only defense would be the threat of retaliation with a similar weapon—the concept of deterrence, even before the Manhattan Project began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This thinking spurred the drive: whoever built the first bomb could dominate the world, a terrifying prospect with Hitler in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Consequently, countries like France, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the US, and even Japan began exploring the possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### The Manhattan Project
#### Scientists' Motivations
The initial primary motivation, especially for Jewish émigré scientists, was the fear of Hitler getting the bomb first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. By 1943-1944, it became evident the Nazis were not close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. However, only one scientist, Joseph Rotblat, quit upon Germany's defeat in May 1945, uninterested in building bombs for US national power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
Victor Weisskopf described their work at Los Alamos as being "in the midst of the darkest part of our science," a stark contrast to the "spiritual quest" physics had seemed before the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Before WWII, physics was an arcane field; Louis Alvarez recalled telling people he had a PhD in chemistry to avoid lengthy explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

#### Oppenheimer's Leadership at Los Alamos
Oppenheimer advocated for a centralized, open laboratory where scientists could freely collaborate, countering General Groves' preferred compartmentalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>. This led to the establishment of Los Alamos.
Even Edward Teller, a critic, acknowledged Oppenheimer as "the best lab director I ever knew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>. Hans Bethe noted that Oppenheimer, who could be cruel before and after the war, was a "superb wise lab director" during it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:33">[01:45:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:04">[01:46:04]</a>. Oppenheimer's broad intellect (he learned Sanskrit to read the Bhagavad Gita) and psychological astuteness contributed to his effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>. He recruited scientists by telling them their work would "certainly end this war and it may end all war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. The average age at Los Alamos was 27; Oppenheimer was 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:39">[02:00:39]</a>.

#### The Difficulty of Fissile Material Production
The crucial and most difficult part of bomb-making is producing the fissile material: highly enriched uranium (U-235) or plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. A physicist told Rhodes that a significant nuclear explosion could be achieved simply by dropping one subcritical piece of uranium onto another from a height of about six feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a> (yielding a few kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>). This underscores that the design is less critical than obtaining the material. This difficulty is, in a sense, fortunate, as it largely restricts bomb-making to nation-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Had unrefined uranium ore been sufficient, the world's uranium would have likely self-destructed long ago, similar to the natural reactors in Gabon two billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

## The Nature and Use of the Bomb

### Atomic Bomb vs. Conventional Firebombing
Rhodes argues that, until the hydrogen bomb, nuclear weapons represented an "escalating gradient" from conventional weaponry like the firebombing of cities such as Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. An American official flying over post-war Japan noted that Hiroshima, after one atomic bomb, looked much like Tokyo after extensive firebombing: "gray broken roof tiles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
The Hiroshima bomb (15 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>) was detonated high (around 1,800 yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>) to maximize fire-starting and minimize radioactive fallout, as planners did not want a reputation similar to that from WWI poison gas use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. These first bombs were essentially firebombs, designed to start mass fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. The intense light (radiant heat of 10,000 degrees) caused severe burns, described as "the world's worst sunburn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were spared from conventional bombing to serve as "clean" targets to assess the atomic bomb's effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. The fact that only one plane delivered the Hiroshima bomb led residents not to take shelter, as single planes were usually weather reconnaissance, increasing casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. By late 1944/early 1945, US military planners were concerned about running out of Japanese cities with enough intact buildings to justify atomic bombing, as most major cities (over 50,000 population) had already been firebombed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

### Impact on Japan's Surrender
The atomic bombs contributed to, but did not solely cause, Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>. The decisive factor was the Soviet Union's declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria on August 8, 1945 (between the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>. Stalin, initially skeptical about the bomb, acted after confirmation of its effectiveness at Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:43">[02:06:43]</a>. The Japanese Emperor Hirohito cited the "new and most terrible weapon" in his surrender rescript on August 15th, providing a rationale for ending the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:45">[02:09:45]</a>.

## The Hydrogen Bomb and Escalation

### A New Order of Magnitude
The hydrogen bomb represents a significant jump in destructive power, capable of being made "arbitrarily large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. The largest tested, by the Soviets, was 56 megatons, with a fireball over five miles in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. This is vastly larger than the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombs (10-15 kilotons); the Tsar Bomba was over 1,000 times more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Daniel Ellsberg noted that the atomic bombs of WWII are merely the *detonators* for modern thermonuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
Edward Teller calculated a hydrogen bomb could theoretically reach 1,000 megatons, but deemed anything over 100 megatons a waste as the energy would largely vent into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Oppenheimer himself stated a hydrogen bomb would have been too large for a target like Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

### Military Push for Bigger Bombs
After WWII, US policymakers, observing that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not more destructive than extensive firebombing campaigns, initially underestimated the A-bomb's city-busting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. This influenced thinking about the number of weapons needed against the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
The US Air Force, to increase its budget share, focused only on blast effects, ignoring fire effects, thus justifying larger numbers of bombs (e.g., 60 for Moscow) and more delivery planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. By the mid-1950s, the Air Force commanded 47% of the defense budget, prompting other services (Army, Navy) to find uses for nuclear weapons, leading to tactical nukes and nuclear submarines, forming the "triad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. Curtis LeMay pushed for bigger bombs so that even if some planes were shot down, the remaining ones would still be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

## The Soviet Program

### Espionage and Indigenous Capability
The Soviets became aware of the US bomb project when they noticed top US physicists, chemists, and metallurgists stopped publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. While espionage occurred (Klaus Fuchs passed dimensions of the Fat Man bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:56">[02:17:56]</a>), Rhodes believes it likely did not significantly accelerate the Soviet program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. Soviet physicists were first-class; by 1947, they had designed a bomb half the weight and twice the yield of the Fat Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. However, Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and the bomb program, demanded an exact copy of the American bomb ("Give me the American bomb or you and all your families will be camp dust"), as they knew it worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. The Soviet practice of industrial espionage focused on proven technologies, not untested designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. Their second tested bomb was their own improved design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. Soviet scientists were motivated by patriotism and the desire to break the US monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

## Post-War Era and Nuclear Strategy

### Early US Nuclear Posture
Immediately after WWII, the US had only a few partly assembled, handmade bombs; its nuclear capability was largely a bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. For instance, B-29s moved to England during the 1948 Berlin blockade were not actually nuclear-capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. President Truman, a former artillery captain, was determined to maintain civilian control over nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

### Attempts at International Control
Several efforts were made to control nuclear weapons:
1.  **Market Cornering:** General Groves mistakenly believed uranium ore was scarce and tried to corner the world market, unaware of rich deposits in places like Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.
2.  **Diplomacy:** Early negotiations failed, partly due to the US Secretary of State's aggressive posture ("I got the bomb in my pocket") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.
3.  **Acheson-Lilienthal Plan:** Developed by a State Department committee including Oppenheimer, this plan proposed an "open world" with international inspections to prevent clandestine bomb-building. If a country violated this, other nations could then escalate responses, from diplomacy to conventional war, and finally to building their own bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
4.  **Baruch Plan:** Bernard Baruch revised the Acheson-Lilienthal Plan for the UN, fatally adding requirements for an international "army" and insisting the US retain its nuclear monopoly until all others signed on, which was a non-starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. The Soviet Union was unwilling to accept a US monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

### The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
In the 1950s, many countries (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Japan, South Korea) were exploring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. John F. Kennedy worried about 10 nuclear powers by 1970 and 30 by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the US and USSR to negotiate the NPT (effective 1970) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. It offered non-nuclear states access to peaceful nuclear energy technology in exchange for forgoing weapons development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. Nuclear powers also pledged to work towards disarmament, a commitment they largely failed to keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
The treaty had a 25-year review (1995), and renewal was uncertain due to the major powers' inaction on disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Diplomatic efforts by figures like Tom Graham successfully convinced nations to extend the treaty indefinitely, contingent on renewed disarmament efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a>. President George H.W. Bush subsequently made significant cuts to the US arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. Today, nine countries possess nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

### Evolving Deterrence and Current Risks
Deterrence seemed to work historically, with the US accepting defeats in peripheral wars (Korea, Vietnam) rather than risk nuclear escalation with major powers backing the opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.
A shift occurred with the India-Pakistan conflict in 1999, where Pakistan used its nuclear arsenal as a shield for conventional conflict, daring India not to escalate to nuclear war [[india_pakistan_geopolitical_dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.
Vladimir Putin is employing a similar strategy in Ukraine, using Russia's nuclear arsenal as a backstop for conventional aggression, warning against external nuclear intervention and even threatening nuclear use if defeated conventionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>. This represents a new, terrifying phase of deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.
Rhodes believes the odds of a nuclear weapon being used in anger in the next 50 years are "high," certainly above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:22">[02:32:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>. Even a "small" regional nuclear war (e.g., 50 Hiroshima-sized bombs each by India and Pakistan) could cause global smoke, reduce sunlight, and lead to up to 2 billion starvation deaths worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:19">[02:33:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:17">[02:34:17]</a>.

## Broader Reflections

### Unintended Consequences
A major theme is "unintended consequences." Nuclear weapons, initially conceived to aggrandize national power, ultimately limited it by making large-scale war between major powers too dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>. This transformation occurred due to scientists exploring how the universe works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>. Niels Bohr described science not as power over nature, but as "the gradual removal of prejudice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:34">[01:51:34]</a>, fundamentally changing humanity's understanding of its place and capabilities.

### Secrecy and Patriotism
The Manhattan Project involved 600,000 people, yet its secret was largely kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. Vice President Truman was unaware of the project until he became President, a result of compartmentalization and the "need-to-know" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:33">[02:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. This level of secrecy was aided by the intense patriotism of the WWII era, where civilians actively participated in war efforts like collecting scrap materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:52">[02:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:16">[02:25:16]</a>.

### The "Manhattan Project for X" Trope
Rhodes views the common call for a "Manhattan Project for X" (e.g., cancer) as often naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.

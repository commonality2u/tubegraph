# [[kyle_harpers_contributions_to_history | Kyle Harper's Contributions to History]]

Kyle Harper is a distinguished historian known for his work that ingeniously intertwines biology, economics, history, and climate to explain significant events throughout human history. His unique perspective sheds light on how these factors have shaped civilizations, with a particular focus on the [[the_fall_of_the_roman_empire | Roman Empire]]. Harper's scholarly contributions include several acclaimed publications that offer deep insights into how environmental and biological elements have influenced historical outcomes.

## Books and Key Themes

### The Fate of Rome

In "The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire," Harper explores how the Roman Empire's collapse was significantly influenced by environmental factors and pandemics. He highlights two major bubonic plague events caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, illustrating their substantial impact on human populations over the last 10,000 years.

Harper discusses how Rome's decline was more multifaceted than previously thought, involving not only political and military challenges but also [[impact_of_climate_change_on_ancient_societies | climatic changes]], such as severe cold snaps, and devastating plagues like the Plague of Justinian in the sixth century.

### Plagues Upon the Earth

His book "Plagues Upon the Earth" traces the [[history_of_infectious_diseases | history of disease]] throughout human civilization, from the Neolithic age to modern times. Harper elaborates on the critical role that infectious diseases have played in shaping human history, supported by recent discoveries in genetics and paleo-climate data.

Harper suggests that the deep interconnections between humans and their pathogens have not only influenced mortality rates but have also impacted [[economic_and_social_structures_of_ancient_rome | economic and social systems]] throughout history. He points out that many serious infectious diseases emerged relatively recently in human history, intensifying as human societies became more interconnected and populous.

### Slavery in the Late Roman World

In "Slavery in the Late Roman World," Harper provides a comprehensive examination of the [[role_of_slavery_in_the_roman_economy | role of slavery within Roman society]]. He elaborates on how slavery in Rome was economically significant yet ideologically distinct from modern racialized slavery, relying instead on property and conquest justifications. Harper examines how Rome's massive use of slave labor influenced its [[potential_factors_influencing_the_roman_economic_development | economy and social structures]].

### Upcoming Work: The Last Animal

In his upcoming book, "The Last Animal," Harper addresses issues concerning extinction and the potential of emerging biotechnologies to resurrect extinct species. He argues for the importance of preserving ecosystems over merely focusing on individual species, emphasizing the deep and lasting impacts human actions have on [[extinction_and_restoration_of_species | biodiversity]].

## Harping on Theoretical Innovation

One of the most significant aspects of Harper's work is his methodological innovation. He employs interdisciplinary approaches to understanding historical phenomena, drawing from climate science, genetics, and epidemiology to offer a multifaceted view of the past.

Harper's work has prompted a reevaluation of how historians consider climate and biology's role in historical narratives, challenging traditional views and opening new avenues for scholarly exploration using [[historical_analysis_techniques_using_modern_scientific_methods | modern scientific methods]]. Through his books and ongoing research, Kyle Harper continues to make substantial contributions to our understanding of history's complex interplay with natural forces.

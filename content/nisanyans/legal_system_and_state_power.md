The legal system and the nature of state power are deeply intertwined, with their evolution shaping societies from traditional structures to modern nation-states. The efficacy and perceived legitimacy of a legal system often reflect the underlying power dynamics within a state.

## Erosion of Law and Authority in Turkey

The arrest of the mayor of Esenyurt is cited as a "legal disgrace" [00:12:53], highlighting a pervasive issue where the law in Turkey is seen as having "no validity" [00:13:03]. In such an environment, once the legal system is broken, the President's orders can supersede court decisions, leaving no higher authority for recourse [00:13:35]. The disregard for rulings from institutions like the Constitutional Court, international human rights agreements, the Supreme Court, and the Council of State further underscores this erosion [00:14:09]. When judges make arbitrary decisions, there is "no point in getting excited about" unlawful rulings, as "there is no law left" [00:14:40]. Law is only effective if it is universal and dominant; its random application is equivalent to its absence [00:14:51].

## Traditional vs. Modern Legal Structures

Historically, in traditional societies (before the 21st century), law was not solely the domain of the courts [00:15:21]. It was established and protected by a network of mutually supportive institutions:

*   **The Family** In the traditional family order, members who committed illegal acts were shamed and punished internally, ensuring compliance [00:15:53]. The family assembly, led by the head of the family, resolved a wide range of issues including minor crimes, rights, payables, damages, and inheritance [00:16:25].
*   **The Neighborhood or Community** Legal relations and disputes among individuals were often resolved under the watchful eyes and pressure of the community. Intervention by neighbors, village elders, and notables frequently settled matters without involving formal courts [00:16:53].
*   **Religious Elders** These figures also contributed to the regulation of legal relations within communities [00:17:33].
*   **Specialized Institutions** Many societies had various levels of justice-distributing institutions for different communities, professional groups, and social status groups, aimed at preventing rights violations [00:17:51].

Formal state law was typically a last resort for "extreme cases" [00:17:48].

## Centralization of Law and its Consequences

The shift towards centralizing all legal disputes within the state's judicial system and relying solely on written law has led to several significant consequences:

*   **Growing Bureaucracy** It creates an "uncontrollably growing legal bureaucracy" [00:18:47], leading to an "astronomical" workload for courts, prosecutors, lawyers, and law firms [00:18:51].
*   **Increased Societal Role** The scale of disputes and crimes becomes astronomically larger, playing a vital role in society [00:19:06]. As traditional institutions (family, neighborhood, religious bodies, professional organizations) lose their function, all disputes are "inevitably" channeled to official state judicial bodies [00:19:21].
*   **Overly Complex Law** The ambition to transform written law into an all-encompassing system covering "millions and billions of possibilities" and intricate details becomes unmanageable [01:19:45]. The sheer volume and complexity of laws become an insurmountable "mountain, an ocean" [00:20:08].
*   **Judicial Dictatorship** This complexity inevitably leads to the state's judicial bureaucracy becoming "increasingly powerful in the face of society" [00:20:27]. It gradually transforms into a [[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | dictatorship]] whose wisdom is beyond question, becoming an "unstoppable disaster" [00:20:51].
*   **Abuse of Power** Due to human nature, those who gain such power will "inevitably" exploit and abuse it, asserting authority with phrases like, "Go to whoever you want, object" [01:21:19]. This ultimately causes the legal system to collapse [01:22:07].

This legal crisis is not unique to Turkey but is also observed in [[power_dynamics_and_elite_control_in_western_societies | Western societies]] such as England, Germany, France, and the United States [01:22:12]. In these nations, the legal system has "surpassed the burden it has undertaken" [01:23:01], leading to a bureaucracy that has become "extremely powerful," integrated, and corrupted, functioning as a "ruling class" [01:23:17]. Lawlessness arises because the law becomes too complex for citizens to understand [01:23:38].

## Liberalism and Institutional Dictatorship

The speaker suggests that liberalism, defined as a political thought that seeks to control various societal elements and a philosophical thought that views the elimination of institutions and traditions as a condition of freedom, is paradoxically resulting in an "institutional dictatorship" across the Western world [02:39:55]. This trajectory presents a "disastrous course" with no clear path to reversal [02:42:32].

## State as Mafia: A Comparison

The speaker asserts that there is "no difference in quality between the state and the mafia" [01:34:18]. Both are essentially the same structure: they "take tribute and provide security in return" [01:34:25]. The state's essence is summarized as "Give me tribute. I will protect you against attacks by 3rd parties" [01:34:33]. A large version is called a "state," particularly when recognized internationally; a smaller, weaker, or illegal version is called a "mafia" or "tribe" [01:34:53]. The underlying logic of their establishment is the same [01:35:47].

## Elections and State Control

Modern elections, especially in the United States, are characterized by intense tension and parties viewing each other as enemies [00:02:28]. The speaker predicts a victory for Trump [00:05:14] by a wide margin, but anticipates the result will be disputed due to accusations of fraud [00:05:26].

Fraud methods include:
*   **Mail-in Voting** The inability to check IDs or verify who cast mail-in votes makes it "impossible to determine who actually cast the votes" [00:05:57].
*   **Manufacturing Votes** On election night, officials can quickly identify non-voters from voter lists and "start manufacturing" hundreds of thousands of votes for these individuals, which then arrive at election centers days later [00:06:19]. This led to "unprecedented voting rates in American history" in critical areas during the 2020 elections, with turnouts of 190-195% in districts that previously saw 50-60% [00:07:02].
*   **Exploiting Non-Voter Lists** In states where mail-in voting closes on election night, statistically identified non-voters (e.g., mentally ill, elderly, hospital residents, long-unheard-from individuals) have their mailed ballot papers collected in an organized manner, filled out, and submitted [00:07:48].

This demonstrates that the "democratic method called elections in the modern world is a fraud" [00:08:46], with no immediate sign of correction [00:09:07]. The speaker believes that the needs and preferences of the state's true owners—the bureaucracy, intelligence, security, and military organizations—are too significant to be left to the "random preferences of the people" [01:24:26]. Therefore, "a serious election is not in question in any country anymore" [01:24:46].

## Religious and National Values: Their Role and Misuse

Religious and national values are vital for societal cohesion, strengthening solidarity and enabling collective action against risks [00:58:43]. Insulting them can harm society beyond a certain point [00:59:26].

However, in countries like Turkey, segments of the educated elite have sometimes considered it a "moral duty" to humiliate religious and national values [00:59:41]. This stems from the misuse of these values by state elites:
*   **Divisive Weapons** If national and religious values are used as "divisive weapons" within society, especially by elites, to humiliate or threaten segments that do not fully align with them [01:01:12], it provokes a negative reaction.
*   **Harassment and Exclusion** Using religious discourse to harass, interfere with lifestyles, humiliate, or spew hatred at certain groups [01:01:58], or using national discourse to exclude, insult, or cast doubt on the loyalty of large segments of the population [01:02:12], leads to a backlash where people seek to "destroy these values" [01:02:53].
*   **Erosion of Values** Since the founding of the republic, and particularly since the 1950s, Turkish statesmen and political leaders have used religious values as a tool for "domestic terror" and as a "stick to beat people," leading to the "erosion of religious and national values" [01:04:20].

For these values to be effective, they must "embrace everyone in society" and command respect, fostering solidarity rather than division [01:04:55].

## The United Nations and International Cooperation

The speaker questions the current function of the United Nations, suggesting it primarily serves as "a source of income for a large international bureaucracy" [01:19:54]. The participation of an important executive member in the BRICS conference in Kazan is seen as a significant step towards creating an "alternative international cooperation platform" to the United Nations [01:20:44].

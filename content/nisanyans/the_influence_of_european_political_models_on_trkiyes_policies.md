The foundation and evolution of Türkiye's national ideology, particularly regarding the concept of "Turkishness" and its role as a unifying element, have been significantly shaped by prevailing European political models and intellectual currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This influence led to [[the_shifts_in_trkiyes_national_ideology_between_1920s_and_1930s | radical transformations]] in the Republic's official stance throughout the 1920s and 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Early Republican Ideology (1920s)

Initially, the Republic's foundations, laid in 1923, were built on the hope that "Turkishness" would serve as a unifying element for its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In the early years, specifically until 1932, the "Central Asian theory" – a notion of Turkish origins from Central Asia – was notably absent from official state publications and Atatürk's writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The prevailing definition at this time suggested that anyone who adopted the Turkish language, culture, or national ideal was considered Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This implicitly included non-Muslims, regardless of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This civic-based theory was the dominant ideology of the Republic's first years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Radical Shift in the 1930s

A radical and rapid shift in ideology occurred from 1932-33 onwards, especially after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. During the winter of 1932-33, discussions emerged about a history book being prepared by the "Great President" that would introduce a racist theory: that Turks originated from Central Asia and founded all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. From 1933, this became the official ideology, coinciding with the First Turkish Language Congress and the First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### European "Winds" and Models

Several factors contributed to this [[the_shifts_in_trkiyes_national_ideology_between_1920s_and_1930s | ideological transformation]], with significant influence from [[Exploration of Western and Turkish political dynamics | European political dynamics]]:

*   **Rise of Nazism in Germany (1933)**: The ascension of Hitler to power in Germany in 1933 drastically altered global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This event marked a turning point, signaling that racism was gaining ground in Europe and that "the wave of the future was Nazis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The idea of "purity" suddenly dominated world discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Türkiye swiftly registered these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Mussolini Model (Italy)**: In 1923, Türkiye considered two primary models: the Soviet model and, more importantly, the Mussolini model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The Mussolini model emphasized that a single will, led by a leader, should dominate everything, uniting society to make significant moves and achieve reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Its core theory can be summarized as "Italianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The shift towards a more racist, Central Asian-focused Turkist ideology in the 1930s was distinct from the statist, leaderist, and totalitarian ideology of the Republic's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. They represented "two different waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Other Contributing Factors

Beyond European influence, internal factors also played a role in this [[Turkish Political Transformation and International Relations | transformation]]:

*   **Resurgence of Old Cadres**: The Central Asianism thesis, popular among the "Progress cadres" in the 1910s, had been silenced after 1922-23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, from 1932 onwards, these previously silent cadres re-emerged, suggesting a change in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Perceived Ideological Weakness**: The founding ideology of the Republic was seen as insufficient to politically unify the country, lacking enough "convincing" or "tasty" appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It primarily resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments, failing to connect with broader society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Regime Turmoil**: By 1930-31, the regime experienced turmoil, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a return to Turkism would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Implications and Outcomes

This new ideology, particularly the idea of assimilation, targeted groups like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The hope was to "crush them if not in one generation," then "assimilate them in two generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, this assimilation project ultimately failed, as the "calculations at home did not suit the market" – meaning the Kurds proved stubborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The republican regime's initial "fascist dynamism" of the 1920s and early 1930s loosened, rendering it unable to carry out the assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This led to significant internal migration from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Regional Comparisons

The speaker notes that other countries in the region exhibit similar patterns of "stupidity and immorality" in their minority policies and attempts to invent artificial histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Examples include the minority policies of Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The efforts these countries undertake to create artificial histories are described as impossible not to question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

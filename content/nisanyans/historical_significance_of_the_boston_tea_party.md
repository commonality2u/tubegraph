The Boston Tea Party was a significant event that occurred in 1773 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. Its 250th anniversary was recently celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

## Background and Causes

Leading up to the event, England began to increase taxes on its colonies in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. Furthermore, England passed laws designed to prevent these colonies from engaging in independent trade outside of England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. A key grievance was that England did not consult the local councils of the colonies when passing these laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This led to a defiant stance from the Americans, who declared they would not accept such treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## The Event

In Boston, a group of militants, including members of a revolutionary organization and children of prominent Boston families, disguised themselves as Native Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. They boarded ships carrying tea imported from England and threw the tea into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. The core message of this act was "we are not paying taxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Significance

The Boston Tea Party is regarded as the "torch" or initial spark of the American struggle for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. It is seen as a foundational event in American history, analogous to the first bullet fired in Izmir during a Turkish historical event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

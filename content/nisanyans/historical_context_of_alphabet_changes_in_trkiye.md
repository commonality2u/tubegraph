The [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] and the language revolution are two entirely independent events in Türkiye's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] occurred between 1927 and 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, while the language revolution began in 1932 and peaked around 1935, indicating a four to five-year difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Necessity of the Alphabet Revolution

The need for an [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] became apparent from the 1860s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Most sensible people in Türkiye began to view a writing reform as a condition for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### Ottoman Era Efforts

During the first Constitutional Era (1908-1918), the Ottoman ruling classes proposed many different ideas regarding alphabet reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. There were considerations to radically reform the Arabic alphabet, transforming it into a fully alphabetic script that could express all vowels and consonants separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Ideas included changing the shapes of Arabic letters to resemble independent, print-like letters similar to the Latin alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Various attempts were made in this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Cultural Shift Towards Westernization

From 1850 onwards, the cultural landscape and orientation of Türkiye's ruling, cultured, and educated classes underwent a complete transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Their horizons shifted, and the West became their primary point of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. All new ideas, educational destinations for their children (such as Geneva, Paris, and London), literary forms, clothing fashions, scientific developments, and concepts in politics, law, and journalism originated from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. They sought to adopt Western norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. In this process, the idea of adopting a Western-style alphabet became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Problems with the Arabic Script for Turkish

The Arabic alphabet posed significant challenges in writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. It is particularly incapable of expressing all vowels and consonants of the Turkish language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Attempts to write foreign words not matching the phonetic structure of Turkish and Arabic using the Arabic alphabet often led to absurd results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. For instance, deciphering old maps and tax records written in Arabic script often makes it impossible to determine the pronunciation of over half the place names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

## Debunking Common Arguments for the Alphabet Revolution

Two common arguments for the [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] are often put forward, but they lack basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Literacy Rates

It is often claimed that the alphabet change increased literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, this argument lacks logical proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
> [!example] Counter-Examples
> *   **Iran**: Preserved the Arabic alphabet, which is also a foreign alphabet for Persian (similar to Turkish), yet achieved high literacy rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
> *   **Israel**: Uses the Hebrew alphabet, which shares the same letters and structural characteristics as the Arabic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. While the Hebrew alphabet was traditionally associated with the Jewish religion, the vast majority of Jews did not know it until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Through systematic education, Israel achieved a nearly 100% literacy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
Based on these examples, the speaker does not believe the [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | Alphabet Revolution in Türkiye]] made a significant contribution to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

### Promoting Westernization

Another argument is that the alphabet change directly helped [[cultural_westernization_and_alphabet_change | Westernization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. While this is not entirely accurate, the speaker acknowledges that a strong pressure for an alphabet change would arise when a country's cultural structure and orientation shift towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Inevitability and the Rise of Other Turkish Scripts

Despite the common arguments, the [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] was an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. The Latin alphabet adopted in Türkiye is undeniably a more advanced alphabet than the Arabic script, better suited for expressing fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

A crucial factor was the emergence of a vibrant publication scene in Türkiye using Turkish written in other alphabets starting from the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   Turkish was increasingly written with Armenian letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   Then, Turkish began to be written with Greek letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
Many Turkish novels and newspapers, covering daily news, international affairs, stock market updates, jokes, and poems, were published in Armenian and Greek letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
Significantly, many Muslims, or Turks, preferred reading these publications over those in Arabic script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. They even learned the Armenian alphabet to read Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This preference stemmed from the fact that both the Armenian and Greek alphabets were much more successful than the old Arabic script in capturing the nuances of spoken Turkish, making them easier and more direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

This growing trend raised the possibility of people shifting towards the Armenian and Greek alphabets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Preventing this shift was difficult with the Arabic alphabet alone, although a massive education campaign might have overcome it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This context further highlights the inevitability of the alphabet change.

## The Language Revolution

Distinct from the [[alphabet_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]], the language revolution started a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Its aim was to eliminate all words of Arabic and Persian origin from Turkish, representing a different and significant historical event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

This article explores the relationship between LGBT issues and societal norms, drawing from discussions about sexual orientation, societal expectations, and demographic trends.

## Defining Sexual Orientation and Societal Norms

Questions are raised regarding whether [[lgbt_symbolism_and_political_implications | LGBT]] is a "Per organized issue" and when sexual orientation transforms into sexual perversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The speaker notes that these are sensitive topics where any answer can provoke anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

A core question in society is whether two or more people can do whatever they want with mutual consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Traditional liberal and libertarian thought, dating back to the 18th century Enlightenment, posits that everything adults do with free will that does not harm third parties is considered free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This concept is described as a valuable idea that has driven humanity's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

However, society also imposes norms to protect its peace, tranquility, and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Ignoring these norms in favor of individual will can overlook potential social harms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Societies establish ceremonies, traditions, and rules for coexistence that distinguish "us" from "the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

The discussion also touches on whether society has the right to defend its own values and traditions against perceived perversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## [[lgbt_symbolism_and_political_implications | LGBT]] as a Societal Pressure Tool

In the Western world, the [[lgbt_symbolism_and_political_implications | LGBT]] movement is seen by some as having evolved beyond a human rights claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It is suggested that it is systematically used by states, particularly the American state, to exert pressure on society, restricting and suppressing its power and freedom of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This development is described as "very strange" and "very, very worrying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Population Dynamics and Sexual Behavior

The discussion addresses global [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | population decrease]] and [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | human reproductive behavior and social dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Wars are deemed ineffective for [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | population decrease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Population Decrease in Western Countries:

*   **Decreased Fertility**: A tremendous decrease in fertility rates is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
*   **Decline of Marriage**: The institution of marriage has been weakened, which naturally impacts the tendency to have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Non-Fertile Sexualities**:
    *   The promotion, honoring, and glorification of transsexual and homosexual lifestyles have led to an enormous increase in the number of individuals preferring homosexual or transsexual identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.
    *   In the United States, figures like 120 are mentioned for homosexual preference, a significant increase from the historical 2-3 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
    *   These actions are seen as radically reducing the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.
*   **Career and Professional Pursuits**: Focus on career, profession, and earning money also contributes to a delay or avoidance of marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Abortion**: Abortion is approved as a birth control method, further contributing to population decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

### Population Control in Other Regions:

The methods above are less effective in Africa and South Asia, where population growth rates remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. A simple technical method proposed to reduce population is informing families of the child's gender from the first week of pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. In a country like India, this could lead to a halving of the female population within a generation due to a higher probability of male child abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. While this reduces total population in the short term, it could lead to polygamy and eventually normalize the population again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

## [[Role of religion in society | Role of Religion]] and Sexuality

The [[role_of_religion_in_society | role of religion]] in society, particularly Islam and Judaism, in regulating sexual behavior is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. These religions claim to regulate every aspect of life, including sexual relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. While such regulation can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>, a concern is raised that contemporary "People's Islam" has developed an obsession with sexual roles and cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This is seen as a deviation from historical Islamic tradition, which was not like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

Modernity is identified as a factor that violently shook traditional [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | sexual roles]] in society, perceived as a significant threat, especially by lower classes clinging to traditional lifestyles and family structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. Urbanization is also noted; while village life traditionally had looser [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | sexual roles]] and more natural sexual lives, migration to cities, with their constrained living spaces, led to increased sexual obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

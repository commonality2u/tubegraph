The concept of social peace in Turkey and the necessity of confronting its historical wounds is a recurring theme in discussions about the country's [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | political and social issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Debating Historical Confrontation
A common question posed is how social peace can be achieved in Turkey unless it confronts deeply ingrained historical wounds and heals them through sincere effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, a different perspective suggests that the idea of "confronting the past" or "past wounds" are merely "shaving words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It is argued that no society truly confronts its past, and there is no inherent need for such confrontation to achieve social peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Instead, it is posited that those in power impose their own viewpoints, historical narratives, and values on the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Conversely, those without power often do little more than "nag and complain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This implies a more pragmatic view of historical narratives in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | social dynamics and politics]], where power dictates the accepted version of the past rather than a collective societal confrontation of wounds.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | nationalism]] globally is often understood as a tool of populism that glorifies the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. However, in Türkiye, [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_in_turkey | nationalism]] is described as a specific pathology and a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>.

## Characteristics of Turkish Nationalism

The speaker characterizes Turkish [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_in_turkey | nationalism]] as:
*   **Moral Blindness** It serves as a symbol of "moral blindness" that *a priori* justifies any dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state, homeland, and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Hatred and Complexes** Those who embody this nationalistic icon, particularly the "semi-educated and cheap modernity-polished classes," spew hatred and complexes towards the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   **Lack of Internal Communication** This attitude leads to a complete loss of emotional communication with their own common strata domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   **Rejection of Islam and National Arrogance** The "Kemalist sect," while verbally rejecting Islam and presenting itself as an alternative, represents the "deepest and most malignant dimension of [[historical_roots_and_impacts_of_nationalism | historical Islam]]'s arrogance of the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. The societal theory underpinning this is "We conquered, Therefore, we are right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Inability to Understand Others** Individuals afflicted by this nationalistic mindset are unable to understand peoples who have been neighbors and subjects of the Turks, nor can they establish emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This extends to displaying ignorance on critical issues like the Kurdish question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a> and an inability to discuss Türkiye's modern history sensibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

The speaker expresses that unless Türkiye gets rid of the "Kemalism disease," the cause of civilization in Türkiye cannot progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Case Studies of Nationalistic Backlash

The speaker recounts several instances where his statements triggered "lynching campaigns on a national scale" due to perceived insults to Turkish identity:

### Black Sea Travel Guide Incident (2000)
A national uproar occurred in 2000 following the publication of a Black Sea travel guide written by the speaker. The campaign, which involved televisions, national, and local newspapers, aimed to "put the impertinent Armenians in their place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Specific statements that caused offense included:
*   **Bayburt Description** Describing Bayburt as a "terribly unique place" where women and girls would "run away as if possessed by a demon" from foreigners entering back streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The comparison to "a place like Afghanistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> caused significant outrage, despite the speaker considering it a correct simile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
*   **Topal Osman Monument** Mentioning the Topal Osman Monument in Giresun and noting that Topal Osman was likened to Abdullah Çatlı during the National Struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This was controversial because Abdullah Çatlı is a figure admired by some and criticized by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The speaker, who knew Çatlı's close friends, stated he did not share Çatlı's ideology or actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **"Natashas" in Trabzon/Rize** Observations about "Natashas" (prostitutes from former Soviet republics) in the Trabzon and Rize regions, noting that their presence had become a "main sector" and describing them as "completely harmless" in a hotel lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This was interpreted as an insult to national morality.

The speaker clarifies that his statements were ironic and offered a "distant view" without being carried away by "standard slogans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The public reaction was fueled by an assumption that any reference to Afghanistan, Abdullah Çatlı, or "Natasha" was inherently insulting to Turkish identity and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Freedom of Speech and Religious Figures (2009, 2012)
The speaker faced campaigns in 2009 for asking about the limits of freedom of speech regarding Allah and the prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In 2012, he was "lynched" for statements concerning the "[[historical_perspectives_on_nationalism_and_identity | historical personality]] of the Prophet Muhammad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. He maintains he never insulted Allah or the prophet and that these campaigns seek to restrict freedom of expression and thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Elazığ Earthquake Incident
The speaker faced lynching for asking a question related to the Elazığ earthquake, questioning the public's emotional response towards the population of the city: "for most of your life you pray that these people would die and then when they die you feel so bad. How is this a thing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. He later clarified that he only expressed concern for innocent children in the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Atatürk's Private Life (2023)
Most recently, the speaker faced backlash for discussing the persistent "gossip" regarding Atatürk's relationship with his adopted daughters and his adopted son, Abdurrahim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. He questions the morality and legality of an adult, single man adopting adolescent girls and keeping them in his private apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. The speaker highlights that this topic is a major taboo in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. He further notes that Abdurrahim's existence as Atatürk's adopted son and theoretical heir was largely suppressed until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>. This information, he argues, is often brought up as a defense mechanism to counter discussions about Atatürk's adopted daughters <a class="yt-27-07">[02:27:07]</a>.

The speaker argues that interest in Atatürk's private life is deemed inappropriate because he is seen as the founder of the Republic and responsible for modernization and secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:41">[02:27:41]</a>. However, he maintains that the adoption of seven girls was inherently wrong, regardless of any physical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:53">[02:28:53]</a>.

## Societal Impact of Nationalism

The speaker describes the consequences of these nationalistic attitudes:
*   **Public Outrage and Threats** Public figures who challenge nationalistic narratives face threats of violence and property destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. However, these threats often come from "keyboard warriors" who do not follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   **Assimilation Policies Failure** Turkish policy towards Kurds, aimed at assimilation, has failed, marking a "terrible defeat" for the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. This failure became evident as Kurds started attending university and seeking civil servant positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. The speaker predicts a new balance where Kurds, with their own ongoing [[the_role_of_language_in_national_identity | nationalism]], will integrate into and take over the system from within, rather than through revolutionary means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>.
*   **Political Marginalization** Nationalistic elites have "no choice but to marginalize themselves in the political arena and embrace the state power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Suppression of History** Certain historical topics, such as Atatürk's private life or his alleged connections with British services during the [[rise_and_fall_of_empires_and_national_identity | Ottoman Empire]]'s collapse, are considered taboo and are not openly discussed in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:16">[02:34:16]</a>. This suppression limits a nuanced understanding of [[history_and_nationalism_in_trkiye | historical events]] and figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:40">[02:34:40]</a>.

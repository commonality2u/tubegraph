The primary issue confronting Türkiye is not a perceived uncouthness or "peasantry" of its population, but rather the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_turkish_elites | poor education of its educated classes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. While the majority of the population are not peasants, with the peasant population having fallen below 120% as of today, and generally considered well-mannered by world standards, a significant problem lies with the "nouveau riche" middle class, which is described as "extremely uncouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Serious problems have also emerged from newly urbanized populations adapting to city culture after leaving village life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

However, the real fault is attributed not to people with village roots, but to the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_turkish_elites | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This class is seen as failing in its mission to guide the country, present ideals, and serve as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Failure to Establish an Elite Education System

The most significant "fiasco" and "defeat" for the Republic of Turkey in education is its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

While the Republic succeeded in bringing minimum-level education to large masses, particularly after 1950 by opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a society requires more than just everyone being educated at a basic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is insufficient to merely train civil servants at one level above this minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Crucially, it is necessary to raise an elite group that can lead society and form its intellectual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Decline of Elite Institutions

Historically, the only opportunities for elite education in Türkiye were a very few schools established during the Ottoman period, many of which were founded by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The Republic of Turkey did not allow these institutions to develop or increase in number; instead, they became smaller, their budgets narrowed, and their scope became more limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

As a result, the number and quality of "seriously educated, world-class educated people" in Türkiye have gradually decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This level of education is now largely achieved only by a very small minority who were "very lucky and found the opportunity to study abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Alienated Elites

Individuals educated abroad often become alienated from Turkish society and find it difficult to adapt to local conditions or assume leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a core issue: if high-quality education is not organically provided within the country's education system, people will send their children abroad, creating a disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Deficiencies in Domestic Education

The domestic education system is criticized as "nothing but a stupid brainwashing program" that teaches individuals "how to be a civil servant and to bow down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Consequently, Türkiye has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Prevention of Elite Religious Education

The prevention of proper education extends to religious scholars. When comparing the quality of Islamic religious experts from the end of the 19th century to those of today, a "chasm" is observed, indicating a significant decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This decline is attributed to an education system that has prevented elite religious education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Despite this, the public still turns to religious scholars for guidance, demonstrating a "tremendous thirst for knowledge" on basic and religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## The Half-Educated Elite

A particularly "terrible" aspect is described as the "ignorance and moral degradation of the half-educated Turks," referring to those who consider themselves "white" or superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This segment, estimated at one to two million people, is considered a "scourge of Türkiye morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. They are characterized by a lack of social responsibility and an absence of instinct to teach or give to others, instead focusing on personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is seen as a direct consequence of how they were educated, as there is no education system in Türkiye with a mission to guide people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Above this group, there is a staff of approximately 50,000 "real elites" who are "terribly alien to this society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. They have no vision or hope beyond leaving Türkiye as soon as possible, and failing that, they try to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This situation is described as a "great tragedy" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

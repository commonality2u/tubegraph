The current [[palestinianisraeli_conflict | Israel-Palestine conflict]] is a complex issue with historical roots, marked by ongoing tensions and a challenging path forward.

## Commentary on Ethnic Cleansing and the [[palestinianisraeli_conflict | Israeli]] Foundation

Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan recently criticized the State of Israel, stating that occupying someone's land, seizing their house, expelling them, and then settling others there is an act of colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The speaker acknowledges this as a true statement and regards Hakan Fidan as one of the most decent individuals within Türkiye's current governing cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

However, the speaker highlights a contradiction: the Republic of Turkey's historical narrative and discourse have glorified ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This makes it hypocritical for a representative of this state to object to others committing ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Ethnic cleansing is described as a tragic constant of human history, often driven by the inability to share limited lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. The worst aspect is not necessarily death, but the uprooting of people and societies from their ancestral homes, leaving wounds that persist for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Denying people their past and rights is deemed terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

The establishment of [[Israel]] is viewed as a "historical disgrace" from this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. European powers, using the persecution of Jews as an excuse, effectively offered the land of Palestine to Jews, ignoring the rights of the long-settled local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Evolution of Views on [[Israel]] and [[Palestinians]]

The speaker notes that [[Palestinians]] were expelled from their lands by force of arms in 1948 and 1967, their lands confiscated, and they were forbidden to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. In 1967, [[Israel]] occupied more areas and established a system of cruelty and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

While acknowledging the injustice, the speaker also notes that land disputes are as old as human history, with victors often expelling the defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. The speaker recalls a period around 2005 when they were inclined to agree with [[Israel]], finding it a civilized place where conditions for humane living had been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. This impression was formed after observing the University of Jerusalem and visiting parts of [[Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. In contrast, visits to [[Palestinian]] villages and towns revealed "misery, ignorance and filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

However, over the last 20 years, this positive feeling has eroded due to [[Israel]]'s political situation, with increasingly fanatical cadres taking power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. These new leaders are described as having a "NATSI ideology" and a worldview reminiscent of 1930s Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. [[Israel]] has adopted a "we are strong, we can do whatever we want" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The current [[Israel]]i Defense Minister's statement, characterizing [[Palestinians]] as "not human but animal," is cited as an example of this hardening ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Repeated bombings and massacres in [[Gaza]] have led to [[Israel]] completely losing its moral superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

## Global Alignment and War Prospects

Today, the world appears sharply divided on the [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Israel-Palestine issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. The overwhelming majority of humanity, excluding America and Western Europe, and including all other continents and countries, are almost unanimously on the side of [[Palestine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

The speaker believes the situation "will not end well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, with a "very strong" possibility of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. If [[Israel]]'s current massacre policy in [[Gaza]] is not countered by [[IsraelIran tensions and global geopolitics | Iran]] and [[role_of_western_and_arab_states_in_geopolitical_conflicts | Arab countries]], these regimes could be in danger due to public impatience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. A major war is seen as "almost inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. The Western world seemingly shares this opinion, evidenced by the deployment of the largest naval force concentration in recent history to the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

### Western Military Predicament

The speaker predicts the West will lose this war, doubting the possibility of the West and NATO winning a conflict against the entire [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | Middle East]] and [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. Such a conflict could escalate to nuclear levels, involving Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Even without nuclear escalation, the West's military power is seen as overextended, similar to the situation in [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including the ukraine and gaza | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. Logistical challenges and distance make it difficult for Western forces to deploy and sustain large numbers of soldiers, unlike Russia's proximity to [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including the ukraine and gaza | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. This imbalance is also applicable to a potential war with China in the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

### Strategic Importance of Jordan

While [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Iran]] controls Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, and can launch military operations through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, the northern border for a fight against [[Israel]] is a narrow funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Strategically, Jordan is the key country, offering a wide front for an attack on [[Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. Jordan is traditionally aligned with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. The speaker predicts that if the war escalates, Jordan might either show unexpected courage and launch a serious attack, or its regime could be shaken by internal developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

## Peace Proposals and Future Outcomes

The speaker believes that "peace" in this context would mean the defeat of [[Palestine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The widely discussed "two-state solution," supported by "many wise people" including Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>, is deemed neither rational nor honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. A two-state solution would condemn [[Palestinians]] to live in a "concentration camp system" or "Bantustan" – a narrow, economically unworkable, isolated, and Israeli-dependent area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.

The speaker sees two primary possibilities for the conflict's resolution:
1.  **Defeat and Cleansing of [[Palestine]]**: [[Gaza]] would be "cleaned up and flattened," and the West Bank would lose further autonomy, leading to defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. This is given a 50-50 chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.
2.  **Defeat of [[Israel]]**: If [[Israel]] is defeated, the State of [[Israel]] would cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

The speaker draws a historical parallel to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1186), a state founded by Western military forces, similar in size to modern [[Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. This Crusader state, despite forming a unique culture over 84 years, was ultimately defeated and destroyed by Saladin's armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. The speaker notes that history repeats itself, suggesting this outcome is a "very strong possibility today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

In conclusion, a permanent solution is deemed possible "only with the elimination of one of the two sides" as a political entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that at this stage, it is difficult to imagine a Palestinian and Israeli political formation coexisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:35">[01:55:35]</a>.

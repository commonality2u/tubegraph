The [[geopolitical_dynamics_in_the_middle_east | Middle East]] is currently experiencing very grave events, with the possibility of keeping recent incidents under control appearing weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Recent Conflicts and Strategic Shifts
The underlying trigger for recent events was the reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which the speaker had previously emphasized as early as five to six months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This reconciliation is seen as an "arrow directed at the heart of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

For years, the United States and Israel fostered meaningless hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This conflict ensured that "no Muslim state neighbor could cope with Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Syria and Iraq, once significant threats to Israel, were destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, allowing Iran to gain great influence and even sovereignty in these countries, as well as in Lebanon through Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This created a belt of hostility from Lebanon to Syria and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, possessing significant financial and military power, were in strong conflict with Iran, which allowed Israel to "sleep comfortably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The coming together of Iran and Saudi Arabia thus represents a "deadly danger for Israel," threatening its existence as a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Gaza and Israeli Policy
The Israeli government, specifically the right-wing coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to have planned the destruction of Gaza as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. The rationale seems to be that as long as Gaza remains, a peace treaty imposed by diplomacy would threaten Israel's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Therefore, destroying Gaza—by deporting its population to Egypt, dispersing them to Europe and [[international_relations_and_geopolitical_shifts_involving_turkey | Turkey]]—was perceived as a rational policy by the Israeli administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Analysis of the October 7th Attack
The speaker believes that the alleged terrorist attack against Israel on October 7th was a planned incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. It is asserted that the Israeli army and its electronic devices could not have failed to detect such an attempt from the border, suggesting they "knew about such an attempt and were waiting for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The speaker questions Israel's willingness to pay the alleged price of 1,000 deaths, baby killings, and rapes, noting that Israel itself is the source of these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Specific claims, such as 260 people killed at a concert, 40 children beheaded, and rapes, are largely discredited due to lack of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Regional Escalation Scenarios
A ground operation in Gaza is anticipated to be very difficult and lead to "very serious blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. A military intervention by Hezbollah from the north would place the Israeli army in "serious trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. If Iran becomes directly involved in the war, a "great apocalypse" is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. There is hope that the situation can be brought under control before reaching such a level, and that Israeli society and the State of Israel will use common sense to restrain or bring down Netanyahu's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. News from Israel indicates "very serious resistance within the army regarding a ground operation in Gaza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Iran has stated to the United Nations, "If Israel doesn't stop, we will stop it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. While Iran's statements can be exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>, the possibility of a war between Iran and Israel is considered "very strong" if Israel does not soon cease its Gaza operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

## International Involvement
### Russia's Stance
Russia is not thought to be ready to engage in another war given its existing commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. There is a "certain sympathy for Israel in Russia, both at the state and the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>, as Russia has been a sponsor of Israel since 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. Many Russians in Israel maintain dual citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. Therefore, Russia is unlikely to immediately join the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. However, if Iran intervenes and appears unable to manage the conflict alone, the situation would change, as Russia "will not allow Iran to be defeated by America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. China is also expected to adopt a similar stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

### Israel's Existential Struggle
The existence of the State of Israel has been a struggle since its establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. It lacks the luxury of defeat, as its statehood would be doubted if it were defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This existential calculation influences many of Israel's seemingly incomprehensible behaviors in both domestic and foreign policy, driven by a feeling of having "nothing to lose" and "no luxury of losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

Israel has never been as close to the point of "existence or nonexistence" since 1948 as it is now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, a situation attributed to Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. The "incomprehensible rage of the right" and a "blinded aggression and war ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>, coupled with a deep racism and disregard for world public opinion, are steering the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. This is seen as a strange turn for a nation that has historically relied on intelligence and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

### Land Ownership and Historical Claims
The claim that Palestinians willingly sold their land is described as "terribly exaggerated and presented in a wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. While some land sales occurred, particularly from large landowners often based in Lebanon or Syria, a very large portion of land ownership in what is now Israel was in Arab hands in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. In the 1948 war, Israelis systematically attacked villages and ensured Palestinians fled, then prevented their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. A very large part of Israel's land was thus seized through "terror and pogroms" rather than being purchased, similar to Armenian lands seized by Turks in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.

The claim to lands based on being present 3,000 years ago is considered illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. It is seen as a claim based on religious mythology, with the "main interesting thing" being its acceptance by Western states like the UN, Europe, America, and England, which claim to represent reason, logic, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. This acceptance is attributed to three factors:
1.  The Western world's sense of guilt over the persecution of Jews in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.
2.  The anti-Semitism in European countries, summarized as "let the Jews go away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.
3.  The "exchange, interdependence and obligation relations" between Jews and Western states/large institutions regarding large money movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

## [[current_geopolitical_tensions_and_economic_strategies | Arabian Peninsula Dynamics]]
The Arabian Peninsula, particularly the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, alongside Oman and Qatar, are evolving into "one of the most dynamic, the bravest, the most future-oriented living regions in the world right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>. These countries are undertaking "very ambitious architectural projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:39">[01:45:39]</a> and are rapidly "leaving their past narrow-minded worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:06">[01:46:06]</a>. Riyadh, for example, is now the city hosting the most international congresses and conferences in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the Arabian Peninsula faces a significant handicap due to its small population, which causes their economies to remain superficial and limits their military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. For Saudi Arabia to truly become a major power, it would need a large proletarian and peasant population, which Egypt could provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>. However, Egypt is considered very backward compared to Saudi Arabia's sophistication, making direct or indirect governance difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>. Therefore, the handicaps of the Arab nations are seen as strong as their advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the crucial role of language in achieving intellectual and cultural dominance, particularly in the contemporary global landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## English as a Global Lingua Franca

English is presented as the common language of the world, a position it is expected to maintain for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. This dominance is attributed to the imperial power of the British and American Empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. However, the speaker suggests that even if these powers decline, English will likely remain dominant as it has become a "common property of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>, encouraging and expanding this international dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. It is argued that English should be further encouraged as an international education language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.

### The Imperative of English for Global Powers

For rising global powers like Russia and China to be truly dominant on an intellectual and cultural level, and to contribute to the minds of humanity, their citizens need to know "flawless English" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This is because these nations "will not be able to teach Chinese to the whole world" or "teach Russian to the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The ability to write literature and poetry in English, engage in major discussions, make films, and dominate social media requires a high level of English proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

### Language and Intellectual Access

The speaker asserts that limiting oneself to reading only Turkish books makes it difficult to become an intellectual or knowledgeable person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While there are many Turkish books available, marginal or risky books that appeal to a small number of people are generally not translated into Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Furthermore, Turkish book production is described as "miserable," and many translations are unreadable, making it difficult to understand the original meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Therefore, if one's interest is in "where the world is going in the 21st century" and "what dynamics are driving the discussion in the world," it is essential to learn a language like English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Language and Societal Development

The example of Canada's immigration policy illustrates the impact of language on urban development and cultural dynamism. Toronto, which accepts immigrants regardless of their English or French language skills, has seen significant growth and dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. In contrast, Montreal, located in the French-speaking province of Quebec, enacted a policy in the 1970s and 80s to only accept French-speaking immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This restricted immigration primarily to French-speaking African countries and Haiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. As a result, Montreal "stagnated and regressed and fallen from caliber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, falling behind Toronto in terms of population diversity, qualified personnel, and quality labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. This highlights the [[evolution_of_language_rights_in_europe | influence of different language policies]] on urban and societal development.

The speaker notes that while Toronto's hybrid multiculturalism leads to a "superficiality and inadequacy" in cultural and social institutions for first-generation immigrants, it is a rare example of such a hybrid community living together peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

## Language and Historical Narratives

The discussion touches on the challenges of interpreting historical events, such as the presence of "Turkish race" on Anatolian lands before 1071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. The speaker cautions against understanding such events through the "idiotic formulas of modern nationalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. The lack of written documents or testimonies makes it difficult to definitively determine the ethnic affiliation of many ancient tribes in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. For example, some Scythian-Sakha tribes are identified as Iranian, not Turkish, although they were intertwined with Turkish elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. This illustrates the complexities and uncertainties in [[the_role_of_historical_narratives_in_contemporary_society | historical narratives]] when linguistic or ethnic affiliations are not clearly documented. The absence of Göktürk script in Anatolia also suggests that such a royal and ceremonial script would not be present without a corresponding Göktürk state or sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>, reinforcing the idea that linguistic presence is linked to established political and cultural structures.

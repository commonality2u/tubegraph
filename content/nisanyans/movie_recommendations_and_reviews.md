## Featured Films

### "As Bestas" (The Beasts)
This film is described as a very dark movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, spoken in the language of the mountain villages of northwestern Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It is a movie that upsets many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Speaker's review**: The speaker loved it and was very impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He found it very striking and it felt very good to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He noted that the film has no moral lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, and the hero, whom the audience applauds and identifies with, was actually wrong, even knowing he was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This creates a different level of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Wife's review**: The speaker's wife, "boss Ira," did not like it and "got a little mad" at him for making her watch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Availability**: The speaker suggested it might be found on illegal sites under the name "Bilo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### "Tangerines" (Mandariinid)
This film is referred to as "Mandarin English" or "Mandarins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It was made in cooperation between Georgian, Estonia, and Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Review**: It is described as another very beautiful movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, well-acted, humorous, deep, and serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The film has very high dramatic tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> and a clear moral lesson, telling how bad war is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Speaker's review**: The speaker liked it, though not as much as the first movie, as he did not feel the same "striking power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Wife's review**: His wife "Iran" (presumably a misstatement of 'Ira') liked it a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

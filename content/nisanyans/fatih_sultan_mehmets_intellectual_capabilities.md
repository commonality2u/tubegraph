The question of whether Fatih Sultan Mehmet was an intellectual, extremely cultured, omniscient, or learned individual is frequently posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it is crucial to approach historical accounts of rulers with skepticism, as ancient historians often employed stereotyped sentences and eulogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This phenomenon applies to Roman emperors, Byzantine emperors, Abbasid caliphs, and medieval Turkish states, where a sultan's portrayal could be manipulated to serve a specific agenda, whether to present him as an ideal example or to condemn him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Ottoman Sources

Very little detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet comes from Turkish Ottoman sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Key works include `Aşıkpaşazade`'s history and other histories written shortly after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. A significant work produced towards the end of his reign (1460s) was an official history of the Ottoman dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

However, the [[role_of_historians_in_shaping_sultans_image | attitude of Turkish historians]] in official histories towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet is described as "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Towards the later years of his rule, he was not a beloved sultan and was associated with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He actively suppressed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property, executing many, and was constantly engaged in war throughout his 30-year reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Byzantine Sources and Their Agendas

More detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet can be found in Byzantine historians such as `Halkondylis` and `Ducas` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Both lived during his time, personally met him, and were familiar with the situation in his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While they wrote praises, their accounts were influenced by political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Their writings often aimed to serve specific interests, particularly in fostering alliances or rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italian states like Genoa and Venice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. These diplomatic realities reflect an age of complex world politics where the Ottoman Empire engaged in intense relations with various imported states, often at war with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Portrayals of Fatih Sultan Mehmet's Intellect

With this understanding of historical bias, statements about Fatih Sultan Mehmet's intellect must be critically examined:

*   **[[comparisons_between_fatih_sultan_mehmet_and_renaissance_rulers | Comparisons to Renaissance Rulers]]**: He is sometimes presented with cliché expressions, as being similar to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Linguistic and Cultural Knowledge**: Claims include that he knew Latin and Italian, and was aware of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Artistic and Architectural Involvement**: Other quoted sentences suggest he was a poet and personally made the architectural drawings for his large projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

A good historian's reaction to such claims is not to question their truthfulness, but *why* they were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Statements about sultans and state administrators are often political in nature, regardless of whether they are positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. They tend to be cliché, ready-made expressions, such as claims of extreme religiosity despite rumors of irreligiosity, or personal observations of secret prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

It is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of these statements, even for those involved in the work or having face-to-face interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Information and vocabulary about rulers are disseminated through various channels, making it challenging to discern a realistic, objective picture centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

The relationship between Taiwan and China, and the involvement of the United States, is a complex geopolitical issue rooted in historical events and strategic interests.

## Historical Background
Historically, there has never been a country explicitly called "Taiwan" in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. The current political situation stems from 1949, when the nationalist government of China was defeated by the communists and fled to Taiwan Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. This national government then claimed to be the legitimate government of all of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. The [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | United States]] accepted this claim due to existing close relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. Consequently, the government in Taiwan was regarded as the representative of all Chinese farmers from 1930 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, leading to Taiwan holding China's seat in the United Nations Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. This arrangement was considered absurd, as the administration in Taiwan did not represent all of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.

## Shifting US-China Relations
In the 1970s, specifically around 1973 or 1974, the [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | United States]] began to establish diplomatic relations with Communist China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. This shift involved Communist China benefiting from Taiwan's separation from its previous status as the sole representative of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Both Taiwan and mainland China continue to agree on the principle of "only one China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>. Agreements made around 1974 aimed to resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. As part of these agreements, the [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | US]] agreed not to try to seize Taiwan, not to recognize it as a state, and to relocate its embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## Taiwan's Independence Movement
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, an independence movement emerged among the indigenous people of Taiwan who did not originate from the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. They asserted that Taiwan was a separate country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. This movement was suppressed, but its display was allowed in a manner that integrated it into the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

## Strategic Importance and Military Encirclement
The [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | United States]] views Taiwan as strategically vital and cannot allow China to absorb it, particularly given Taiwan's position as a global leader in electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. Since 1949, the [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | US]] has established a significant military encirclement around China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This military chain, which includes Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>, effectively places China in a state of war, supported by approximately 121 nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. Taiwan is considered the weakest link in this encirclement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

The [[current_geopolitical_tensions_and_economic_strategies | US]] continues to assert the "One China" policy while maintaining a strong military presence around China. [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | America]] has lately begun to stir up issues related to Taiwan as a provocation, aiming to force China into a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. This approach is unlikely to lead to major trouble or disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

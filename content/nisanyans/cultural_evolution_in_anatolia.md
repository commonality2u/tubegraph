## Impact of the Printing Press on Culture and Language
The advent of the printing press in Turkey, while less researched in its specific effects compared to Europe, correlates with significant socio-cultural shifts [00:04:46]. The proliferation of printed materials is closely linked to the emergence of a central bureaucracy and professional classes [00:05:05]. Alongside this, the press facilitated the development of formal state-determined education [00:05:27].

This period saw the rise of an educated class whose cultural preferences and value judgments began to diverge from those of the majority society, leading to the formation of a new elite class and authority [00:05:42]. While traditional narratives suggest the printing press made information more autonomous and fostered a freer world [00:02:08], a counter-perspective argues it strengthened central control mechanisms and guided societies more rigidly [00:02:37]. The established view in Europe is that the printing press led to the fragmentation of ideas previously controlled by institutions like the church, increasing liberation from their control [00:07:46].

In Turkish society, the printing press had a similar effect. Prior to its widespread use, written culture was primarily confined to private, family, and neighborhood life [00:08:06]. Knowledge and narratives were shaped and transmitted by religious institutions [00:08:58]. With the printing press, there was a radical shift, as new thought currents and writing classes emerged [00:07:27].

### Standardization of Language and Social Hierarchy
The printing press also profoundly impacted language history, leading to unexpected results [00:14:19]. Before the 15th century in Western Europe, Latin was the common cultural language for serious literature [00:14:30]. However, with the printing press, a need arose for cultural languages closer to common speech to expand the market beyond the narrow circle of Latin speakers [00:16:08]. This led to the creation of new cultural languages, such as French, which appealed to wider, albeit geographically narrower, audiences [00:17:09].

A significant result was the rapid standardization and fixation of the printing language [00:17:42]. Previously, dialects within regions like France and England were highly fluid and often mutually unintelligible [00:17:59]. The printing press halted this rapid evolution, creating a new standard that everyone had to adapt to, which was then taught in schools [00:19:14].

This standardization also established a new social hierarchy [00:20:01]. The new standard language, often that of the capital and administrative elite, became a marker of status [00:20:14]. Dialects further from this standard, like Antep Turkish or Erzurum Turkish, became marginalized and stigmatized as "second-class" or the language of "ignorant people" [00:22:17]. The language of school became equated with the standardized language of the printing press [00:22:55].

## Shifts in Power and Society in Eastern Anatolia
Eastern Anatolia, specifically the provinces east of the Euphrates, was historically governed by Kurdish principalities from the 16th to the early 19th century [00:32:15]. These beyliks, like Hakkari and Botan, functioned as de facto independent states, collecting taxes and maintaining their own armies, while theoretically paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire [00:32:37].

### Ottoman Centralization and Its Aftermath
During the reign of Mahmud I, the Ottomans systematically dismantled these principalities, establishing direct state authority by appointing governors and collecting taxes [00:34:54]. This centralization, completed around 1841 with the submission of the Hakkari bey, ushered in a period of significant chaos and anarchy in the Kurdish regions [00:35:10]. By the 1870s, parts of the population, particularly the Armenians (about one-third of the population), sought Russian intervention due to the instability [00:36:14].

### Rise of Naqshbandi Sheikhs and Religious Influence
In this vacuum of authority, a series of Naqshbandi Sufi sheikhs, followers of Mevlana Halid from Baghdad, began to establish increasing influence and sovereignty in the region [00:36:53]. Prominent figures included Sheikh Ali Set in Palu, Sheikh Sibghatullah Arvasi in Hizan, and Taha Ari in Semdinli, many of whom claimed Sayyid (descendant of the Prophet) lineage [00:37:11]. This network of Naqshbandi sheikhs spread rapidly around the 1860s-1870s [00:37:35].

Sultan Abdulhamid actively supported these sheikhs, seeing them as crucial for re-establishing Ottoman sovereignty in the region [00:38:00]. These Naqshbandi lodges and their leaders, through their numerous sons and caliphs, gained control over the entire Kurdish geography [00:38:19]. They also increased their economic power, notably by seizing properties from churches and monasteries [00:38:44]. An interesting phenomenon during this period was the support of a significant portion of Armenian villagers for this new religious power against traditional church authority. Many Armenians converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to these Kurdish sheikhs, leading to radical demographic and cultural transformations in areas like Hizan and Mutki [00:39:05]. This process broke down the institutional structure of Armenian society and established a new religious sovereignty [00:40:04].

### The Sheikh Said Rebellion and its Context
Sheikh Said, a grandson of Sheikh Ali Sepin, was a highly revered figure within this Naqshbandi organization, and his family had established a dominant structure in the Hınıs region with Ottoman backing [00:40:24]. With the establishment of the Republic, these religious leaders felt a profound sense of betrayal [00:41:24]. The new regime, represented by district governors and captains, declared them obsolete, stripping them of their power [00:41:47]. The speaker suggests that from the sheikhs' perspective, this would naturally incite rebellion [00:42:03].

The Sheikh Said rebellion (1925) is often seen from different perspectives: as a Kurdish national movement, a British-provoked attempt to destabilize the regime, or a religious uprising against secularism [00:30:14]. Sheikh Said, contrary to popular perception of an "ignorant village imam," was a scion of one of the most prestigious aristocratic families in the Kurdish region, with powerful lineage and relatives [00:31:18]. His rebellion can be understood as a reaction by traditional elites to the loss of their centuries-old influence and authority under the new republican order [00:31:44].

The suppression of the Sheikh Said rebellion in 1925 was marked by extreme cruelty, with tens of thousands killed, villages burned, and widespread oppression in the Kurdish region [00:28:03]. The new Turkish regime sought to demonstrate overwhelming force, surpassing even Ottoman measures [00:28:47].

## Western Educational Influences: American Colleges
American Colleges were established in various parts of [[impact_of_architecture_in_anatolia | Anatolia]], predominantly by Protestant missionaries [00:52:44]. The primary goal of these colleges, such as those in Harput and Antep, was not to educate Turks or Muslims, but to convert Armenians to Protestantism [00:53:06]. While attempts to convert Greeks were unsuccessful, Armenians were more receptive [00:53:18].

For Armenians at that time, Protestantism represented modernity, good education, contemporary clothing, and a rebellion against the traditional priestly class [00:53:30]. These colleges aimed to train teachers, doctors, merchants, and other qualified professionals, thereby facilitating access to modern culture [00:53:57]. Overwhelmingly, students were Armenian, and later, the teaching staff became largely Armenian as well [00:54:27].

These educational institutions were established in areas with significant Armenian populations that had experienced [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration]] from eastern villages to cities like Adana, Kayseri, Merzifon, Gürün, and Ankara during the 19th century [00:55:00]. This [[urbanization_and_cultural_adaptation_in_turkey | urbanization and cultural adaptation in Turkey]] was driven by a shift from agrarian life to urban professions as craftsmen, tradesmen, and professionals [00:55:30].

## Tarsus: A Historical Case Study of Cultural Transformation
Tarsus serves as a prime example of [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | cultural and ethnic history in Turkey and the surrounding regions]]. In ancient and medieval times, Tarsus was the capital and port of Çukurova [00:56:25]. Its status changed over time due to alluvial deposits, leading to its current inland position and loss of port function [00:56:36].

*   **Roman Period:** Around 60 BC, the Romans made Tarsus the capital of their newly formed province of Cilicia. Famous figures like Cicero served as governor there [00:57:05]. Saint Paul, a key figure in Christianity, was a Jew from Tarsus, highlighting its importance [00:57:31].
*   **Arab Rule:** In the late 7th century (around 650-660 AD), Tarsus came under Arab rule for 300 years, serving as an Arab province and regional capital [00:57:44].
*   **Byzantine and Armenian Influence:** Byzantium later reclaimed Cilicia, and in the 11th century, an Armenian governor named Abul Garib, who came from an Armenian royal lineage but used an Arabic name, was appointed [00:58:11]. After the Battle of Malazgirt (1071), many Armenians migrated from the east and settled in Cilicia, with Abul Garib playing a role in establishing Armenian feudal lords [00:59:11]. When the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was established, Tarsus was the nominal capital where coronation ceremonies were held, though the actual capital was moved to Kozan for security [00:59:49].
*   **Mamluk and Turkmen Rule:** By the mid-14th century (around the 1350s), the Mamluks of Egypt captured Cilicia, including Tarsus, making it a Mamluk garrison center with a significant transplanted Arab population [01:00:59]. However, the Mamluks handed the administration of the wider region to a Turkmen chieftain named Ramazan, whose Ramazanoğlu Principality ruled from Adana, a city that quickly surpassed Tarsus in importance [01:01:40].

These narratives demonstrate the continuous interplay of power struggles, cultural symbols, and migrations that shaped the cultural fabric of [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | Anatolia]] [01:03:32].

## Broader Reflections on Cultural Change
The discussion also touches upon the broader phenomena of capitalism and advertising culture. The speaker describes a "greed for money" as a timeless human trait, often criticized but always present [01:32:07]. However, in modern society, particularly from the mid-19th century, this desire to make money became the dominant societal value, with capital accumulation (or "growth") becoming the sole valid vision, often imposed by a ruling group [01:33:33]. The speaker views this as a disgrace and a cultural collapse [01:35:09].

Furthermore, modern society, especially in North America, is characterized by a constant bombardment of advertising, which the speaker defines as "the art of lying" [01:35:19]. This normalization of lying for profit has become a defining, albeit immoral, principle of Western civilization [01:37:20]. While prevalent in American society since the early 20th century and in Europe for the last few decades, it has not yet reached the same level of dominance in Turkey [01:36:53].

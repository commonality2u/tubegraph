Western intervention in non-Western countries is a multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing historical narratives, geopolitical strategies, and the evolution of international relations. This intervention can manifest as direct political and military involvement, economic influence, cultural imposition, or the strategic manipulation of historical events.

## The Armenian Genocide and Shifting Western Policy

The commemoration of the Armenian Genocide on April 24, 1915, is a deeply emotional event, particularly in Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The events of April 24, 1915, involved the arrest and subsequent killing of prominent Armenian intellectuals across the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This was a political collapse operation, aiming to eliminate the societal leaders who could vocalize dissent before the systematic deportation of civilians began in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The speaker asserts that denying the genocide is either "complete ignorance" or "immoral," often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, and is known by almost everyone globally, except Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Turkey's official policy regarding the Armenian Genocide shifted significantly over time:
*   **Silence (Pre-1965/75):** Until around 1965, the Republic of Turkey maintained a policy of silence on the genocide, neither discussing nor denying it publicly, benefiting from a high reputation in the [[Western Cultural History and Modern Challenges | Western world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union's Role (1965):** The issue was first broadly re-agendized by the Soviet Union in Soviet Armenia in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
*   **Post-Cyprus Shift (1974/75 onwards):** After Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974, Turkey's relations with the West deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This led to a strong anti-Turkey sentiment in [[Western Cultural History and Modern Challenges | Western countries]] like America, France, and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. The Armenian Genocide was then used as a "stick to beat Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>, with the emergence of organizations like ASALA and a sudden remembrance of the genocide in the [[Western media and propaganda in conflict reporting | Western press]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Turkey's response of outright denial, while seen as foolish by the speaker, persisted for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   **Brief Hope (2005-2012):** A "window of hope" opened between 2005 and 2012 for Turkey to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. During this period, the genocide was discussed more openly in Turkey, with some acknowledging the "terrible thing" that happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. However, official courage to take this step was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

## Western Involvement in Contemporary Conflicts

### The Ukraine War
Some [[Western Involvement in the Ukraine War | Western leaders]] and politicians, such as Cem Özdemir of the German Green Party, advocate for stronger [[Western Involvement in the Ukraine War | Western support for Ukraine]] through increased weapons supply, viewing Russia's war as a threat to the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This stance is criticized as "American servitude" and aiming to "burn the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. In contrast, Germany's Social Democratic Party's Prime Minister attempts to follow a more cautious and balanced policy to protect German, European, and global interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. The speaker predicts a future shift back to a Social Democrat-Christian Democrat coalition in Germany to counter the current "Atlanticist NATOist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

### Pakistan and US Foreign Policy
The United States' foreign policy in Pakistan, particularly its role in the overthrow of Imran Khan, is seen as a "mistake that the United States of America will regret for a century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Imran Khan directly challenged America's stance in the [[Western Involvement in the Ukraine War | Ukraine-Russia war]] by continuing economic relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. A significant geopolitical development is the convergence of Pakistan and India on a common foreign policy front for the first time since 1947, which poses a "trouble" for the West's regional policy structured on maintaining conflict between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. The speaker suggests America orchestrated Khan's removal by leveraging parliamentary members, but believes they miscalculated the public's widespread revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

## Historical Examples of Western Influence and Cultural Challenges

### Ethiopian Christianity and European Attempts at Conversion
In the 16th century, when Ethiopia faced a Muslim threat supported by the Ottomans, it sought help from the Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. However, the Europeans then tried to convert the Ethiopian Coptic Christians to Catholicism through intense missionary activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. This attempt resulted in the Ethiopians overthrowing and executing the European missionaries and establishing a self-return movement, viewing the Europeans as enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

### The "Dead End" of Westernization
In the 19th century, many non-Western countries, including the Ottomans and Ethiopians, faced the dilemma of modernization and Westernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. They sought to adopt Western advancements without sacrificing their own religion, essence, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. This approach is described as a "Dead End," experienced by many countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. The speaker notes that the West has ceased to be an attractive model or center of attraction, now perceived as a "hated mad senile" nuisance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

## The Nature of Western Intervention: The US as a "Global Empire"

The speaker argues that the United States has established a new type of "rough global empire" since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. This model differs from traditional empires by:
*   **Indirect Control:** It does not directly take over administration or collect taxes in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.
*   **Exercising Sovereign Rights:** The US funnels money through other methods, determines foreign policies, provides military decisions, and places its personnel at key positions in other countries, reducing many heads of state to "provincial governors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Reciprocity:** Unlike old empires (e.g., Roman, British, Tsarist) which had obligations to their citizens and provided some rights and services, the US empire exerts sovereignty without reciprocal obligations or duties to the governed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. This makes it an "unlimited responsibility" model from the US perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

## The Concept of "Interference"

The categorical statement "Do not interfere with the internal affairs of another country" is deemed simplistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. Neighboring countries sometimes must interfere if cohabitation requires neighbors not to disturb each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. States must calculate the long-term results of their decisions, as domestic policy mistakes in one country can cause trouble for neighbors years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>. Therefore, interference can be a "duty towards its own people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. However, there is a limit to this decency and measure, akin to not prying into a neighbor's bedroom but intervening if they are playing loud disco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current global dynamics are characterized by a "lot of mess" and a shift into an era of multi-directional influence, moving away from the sole dilemma of Westernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

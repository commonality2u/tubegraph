The host's podcast content is being compiled and published into a book. The idea originated from a discussion with a publisher and publishing house, despite it not having occurred to the host previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The host views the original podcast as a "chat program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Development and Scope
Work on the [[compilation_book_from_sunday_chats | compilation book]] began with a week of selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This process revealed a "pretty big collection" from the Sunday chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The podcasts span 184 weeks, totaling more than an hour each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, resulting in approximately 200-220 hours of spoken content, with "a meaningful word or two in between" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The resulting book is planned to be released in "several volumes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Editing Process
The host is actively involved in correcting and collecting the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This intensive work involves reviewing instances where "reactionism is spoken openly" or "very absurd words" were used, acknowledging that "the bridges of logic" might not have been correctly built at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

A specific area of self-critique during this process is the host's speaking habits, particularly the use of filler words like "this" and repeating phrases, indicating a need to become "more proficient in this performing arts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

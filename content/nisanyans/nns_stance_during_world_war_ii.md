İsmet İnönü's leadership during World War II was characterized by a cautious and pragmatic approach aimed at keeping Turkey out of the global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. His policies, both domestic and foreign, were shaped by a deep understanding of the country's vulnerabilities and the volatile international landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Policy of Caution and Neutrality

İnönü's economic policies during this period were notably cautious and restrictive, reflecting his clear understanding of the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. He was accused of being financially conservative and strict, a stance that would shift after 1946 when the United States opened credit lines, allowing for a rapid economic expansion policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

A primary goal of his administration was to prevent Turkey from entering the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The Turkish army in 1940 was described as being in a "miserable desert" state, making entry into the war, even on the side of the Allies, a potential "loss" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Comparisons to the devastating experiences of countries like Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which fought and were defeated, underscored the wisdom of Turkey's non-involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. The idea that Turkey could have achieved democracy through defeat, similar to Germany, Italy, and Spain, was dismissed as unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Balancing Act

İnönü pursued a "two-faced policy" externally to navigate the complexities of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. This strategy involved skillful maneuvering to appease both the British and Americans while keeping them at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. A key aspect of this diplomatic bargaining was preventing Germany from acquiring critical Turkish minerals, such as chrome, which was essential for high-quality steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. When Germany's defeat became imminent, İnönü's administration swiftly purged pro-German elements like the Saraçoğlu and Peker teams, establishing a government more amenable to dialogue with the British and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>.

## Domestic Impact and Controversies

The war years brought significant hardship to the Turkish populace, including the implementation of ration cards for bread and forced labor for peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Despite these measures, the suffering was considered minimal compared to countries directly involved in the conflict like Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

Ironically, while the First World War was often remembered with a "military angel" sentiment despite terrible losses, the Second World War era, marked by ration cards, generated hatred towards the administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This disparity is attributed to the "plunder and tremendous wealth transfer" that occurred during WWI, affecting popular attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Policies such as the Varlık Vergisi (Wealth Tax) and conscription measures, while seemingly harsh, were influenced by İnönü's inherent cautiousness, preventing them from being implemented to their full extent as instruments of "plunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

### Treatment of Non-Muslim Populations

During the war, there was a fear of territorial loss, which was not present in the Second World War as the need for American support was clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. However, the government's approach to its non-Muslim population was particularly harsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. The male non-Muslim population was reportedly sent to concentration camps twice in two years, though they were later secretly released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. This policy, described as "very strange" by the standards of the World Wars, was a deliberate decision by a "stern" government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. It was part of a broader strategy to consolidate the non-Muslim population within Istanbul and purify other parts of Anatolia of remaining Armenian communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. The motivation for this policy, whether "stupidity, racism, and hostility" or a "rational" necessity for state survival, remains an unanswered question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

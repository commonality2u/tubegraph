April 24 is recognized globally, especially in Armenia, as the day of [[commemoration_of_the_armenian_genocide | commemoration]] of the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This day holds significant emotional weight in Armenia, with the entire population participating in a walk to the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the event is profoundly humanitarian and affects people deeply, the speaker notes a personal shift in their attitude towards national feelings and expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Events of April 24, 1915

April 24 is not directly related to the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] itself, but rather marks a critical political step preceding it, which is essential for a full understanding of subsequent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities, 235 to 250 prominent Armenian figures of the Ottoman Empire—including writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters—were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A few days later, groups were sent to locations in Anatolia, specifically Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Some managed to escape, but many were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This "political collapse operation" is a recurring pattern in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman period, where the state gathers intelligence and then swiftly apprehends individuals, regardless of guilt or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly opposed to extremist Armenian nationalist movements, as well as those with no organizational ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the political leaders and those who could voice dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Similar operations were carried out in cities like Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This process gradually escalated and devolved into mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## [[political_and_historical_implications_of_genocide_denial | Political and Historical Implications of Genocide Denial]]

The speaker states that denying the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is a "waste of time" and indicative of ignorance or immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. It is a fact known by almost everyone in the world, including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, with Turkey being the exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

The Turkish state, for various reasons, consciously and systematically designed a [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] project starting around 1895, preparing its infrastructure from 1913, and implementing it in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The objective was the elimination of the Armenian and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Turkish State Policy Shifts

Until 1975, and especially until 1965, the Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Turkish officials were aware of the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] but preferred not to discuss it publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This policy of silence was effective largely because Turkey's reputation in the Western world was high, and there was a general consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

A turning point came in 1965 when the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] was brought back to the global agenda, primarily by the Soviet Union on the 50th anniversary in Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The policy of active denial emerged around 1975, shortly after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This period saw the rise of organizations like ASALA, which targeted Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Subsequently, the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] was widely remembered in the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Turkey's response was a policy of denial, designed by officials like Coşkun Kırca and others from the Foreign Ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Once this policy was adopted, Turkey became entrenched in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

This policy was seen as a "fiasco" from its inception in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. After 1974, Turkey's international standing, particularly in the Western world, declined significantly due to the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The denial of a universally acknowledged past crime by Turkey was then used as an "excuse to provoke" and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This "stupid policy" has persisted for over 45 years, despite its detrimental effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Attempts at Reconciliation

Between 2005 and 2011, a "window of hope" emerged for Turkey to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. A significant hope for confronting the issue arose across the political spectrum, with mainstream media outlets like Radikal, Milliyet, Hürriyet, and even Islamic publications like Yeni Şafak (which was balanced at the time) advocating for facing the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. For the first time, the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] was openly discussed in Turkey, with many opinion leaders acknowledging the terrible events that led to the misery and expulsion of millions of Armenians, the "real children of this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Such acknowledgment was seen as crucial for Turkey's conscience and to shed the burden of hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. It was also believed that confronting this issue would help Turkey overcome a "mental illness" it has carried for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

The speaker personally campaigned for Turkey to confront this issue until around 2014, viewing it as essential for Turkey to become a healthier society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_Turkey | Political and Social Implications of Ethnic Shifts in Turkey]]

The [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is identified as the most significant social and political event of the 20th century in Turkey, profoundly changing the society's demographic composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. The psychological and economic underpinnings of Turkey's political transformation and structures are rooted in the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] and the cleansing of other non-Muslim populations, including Greeks and Assyrians, representing Turkey's greatest trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

The idea of cleansing Anatolia from non-Muslim populations was advocated since the 1890s, during the era of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. While the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) initially held an optimistic approach upon coming to power in 1908, aiming to overcome these problems, they soon reverted to Abdulhamid's mentality and program by 1909-1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Following the Adana events of 1909, the CUP came to the conclusion by 1910-1911 that a "new Turkey" could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

Despite a period of chaos during the Balkan War in 1912, the CUP cadres returned to power in 1913, having already finalized the plans for 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The project of cleansing Anatolia of non-Muslims was pursued consciously and resolutely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

For populations like Greeks, the process was "relatively easier" due to mutual population exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. For instance, Greece had cleansed Macedonia of Turks and later Bulgarians, creating land for settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Western Thrace was also given to Greece to settle the 1.5 to 2 million Greeks leaving Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Reciprocally, Greek immigrants settled in vacated villages in Turkey, while Turks, Pomaks, and Albanians from Greece were settled elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

However, "there was no place for the Armenians to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Deporting them would be a disaster for the Ottoman Empire, which was fighting Russia in World War I, as it would provide material to the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Given the high probability of defeat and the potential loss of territories like Erzurum and Van, there was no practical place to deport Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Initially, the idea of deporting Armenians to Syria was considered, anticipating Russia's withdrawal from the war and Syria's abandonment post-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. However, this situation quickly got out of hand, and it became clear that there was no solution other than "cleansing" and "massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This was done to prevent Armenians from returning after the war and claiming their lands, homes, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the need to face these facts for a healthier, calmer historical discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. As long as denial persists, productive dialogue is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. While the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] issue was once a tool to provoke Turkey, the country eventually weathered the crisis without fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. A significant opportunity to open new paths and horizons was thus lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

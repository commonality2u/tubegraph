This article explores the historical origins and evolution of various words within the Turkish language, drawing connections to broader cultural, military, and scientific shifts. It also delves into discussions about the nature of lexicography and the contested origins of certain ethnic groups and their languages.

## The Evolution of Military Terminology: Strategy and Tactic

The word "strategy" is a modern concept in military science, emerging during the Napoleonic wars when military thought, theory, and doctrine rapidly evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The term itself is rooted in Ancient Greek, where "strategos" meant commander, and "stratos" meant army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. While "strategia" was used in ancient times, it referred to the commander's office or rank of generalship, not the modern concept of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The English word "strategy" first appeared in 1810, while its French equivalent was only documented after the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

In the context of the Ottoman army's modernization around 1880, two new Ottoman words were coined to translate "strategy" and "tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>:
*   **Sevkülceyş**: Meaning "dispatch of the army," a literal translation of "strategia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.
*   **Tabiye**: Meaning "positioning," a literal translation of "tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

These terms were widely used in Turkish until the 1940s and 1950s, persisting even into the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. However, they were eventually replaced by the direct French borrowings "strategy" and "tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.

## Distinguishing Arabic-Derived Words: "Mesel", "Misal", and "Mesele"

Confusion can arise from words that appear similar but have distinct [[etymology_and_the_origins_of_turkish_words | origins]] and meanings. For instance, the words "mesel," "misal," and "mesele" are often mistakenly thought to be derived from the same root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
*   **Mesel**: Means "tale" or "example" (from the same root as "misil," "emsal") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
*   **Mesele**: Means "question" or "issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>. In older madrasah sciences, it was an academic concept referring to a subject for discussion, akin to the Latin "quaestio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. These two words ("mesel" and "mesele") have no [[etymology_and_the_origins_of_turkish_words | etymological]] relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

## The Influence of French on Turkish Vocabulary

From approximately 1810-1820 until the 1960s, French served as the primary reference language for Turks as [[historical_context_and_analysis_of_turkish_literature_and_culture | Turkey]] adapted to the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. A staggering 4800 words in the standard Turkish vocabulary (excluding specialized terms) are estimated to have entered Turkish from French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. This influx reflects the adoption of new concepts related to:

### Cultural Innovations
*   **Gazeta** (newspaper): Introduced shortly after the French Revolution, heard in İzmir around 1796-98, then in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
*   **Musician** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>
*   **Lotarya** (lottery): Circa 1820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>
*   **Sofa**: A new type of furniture with a backrest, imitated from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>
*   **Billiards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>
*   New clothing items: **Coat** and **tie** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>
*   **Cigarette** and **cigaret**: Emerged in the 1840s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>
*   **Ticket**: A new concept for public organized entertainment and transportation, previously absent in Ottoman and Islamic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>

### Technical and Scientific Advancements
*   **Vapen** (steamship): Directly taken from French "bateau à vapeur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>
*   **Cifer** (railway): From the 1830s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>
*   **Telegraph**: A new concept from the 1820s-1830s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>
*   **Electricity**: Documented as early as 1811 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>
*   **Physics**: A new scientific concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>
*   **Thermometer** and **barometer**: Representing new measurement techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>
*   **Cholera**: The name of the disease that entered Ottoman lands in the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>
*   **Kotra**: A new type of boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>

### Commercial Products
*   New fabrics: **Calico** and **flannel**, products of the Industrial Revolution imported from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:58">[01:32:58]</a>
*   **Lampshade** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:21">[01:33:21]</a>
*   **Diamond**: Referring to a specific cut, a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>

### Institutional Innovations
*   **Bank**: The concept of a bank as an institution was new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>
*   **Parliament**: A French concept intensely discussed in France and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:54">[01:33:54]</a>
*   **Komutan** (commander): Transferred from French, likely around 1820-1830 during the first revision of Ottoman Land Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>
*   **Policy**: In the 19th century, this referred to interstate diplomacy and diplomatic procedures, a new concept for the Ottomans who previously might have called it "intrigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. Its adoption coincided with the Ottoman Empire's desire to join the European community of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>.
*   **Dictator**: A known word since Napoleon's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>
*   **Police** and **gendarmerie**: Completely new concepts, likely invented around the 1840s or during Mahmud II's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>
*   **Budget**: Also introduced during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:20">[01:37:20]</a>

In contrast, French borrowed very few words from Turkish in this period, mostly older terms like "sorbet" or "cafe" from the 16th or 17th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.

## Modern Lexicography and the Kube Altı Dictionary

The Kube Altı dictionary is considered the best of its kind among Turkish dictionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. However, its main shortcoming is its conservatism, idealizing a "frozen Turkish" from the 1950s-1960s, a period when the press and cultural discussions were very strong in [[historical_continuity_in_Turkey | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. This perspective views later developments in Turkish as "creepy barbarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>.

A modern dictionary, however, should move beyond print lexicography, which is considered "stone age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>. The ideal modern dictionary would be:
1.  **Crowdsourced**: No single person or committee can keep up with the rapid evolution and creation of new words in a language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>.
2.  **Bot network**: A technical infrastructure to instantly detect and collect all Turkish words used across social and non-social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>.
3.  **Strong editorial team**: To compile and organize the raw material with broad cultural and linguistic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

This approach acknowledges that "Turkish" encompasses any word people use and understand in a conversation, regardless of its original [[etymology_and_the_origins_of_turkish_words | origin]] or correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

## The Question of Urartian and Kurdish Linguistic Ancestry

The question of whether Urartians were [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Armenian]] or [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish]] is complex. The Urartian language was an inscription language, likely dead or sacred, used mainly by kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. There is no evidence of a people called "Urartians" in historical sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.

Regarding [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish]] ancestry:
*   In the period between 1000 BC and 550 BC, Kurds did not exist as a distinct people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>.
*   The **Medes** were a distinct nation living in western Iran (Kermanshah and Tabriz regions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. Their connection to modern Kurds is a subject of intense debate with no definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>.
*   The **Corduene** tribe, mentioned in historical texts as living in areas like today's Şırnak and Hakkari, are considered ancestors of the people who came to be known as Kurds from the 10th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>.

While there is certainty that Kurds existed in [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | Anatolia]] 150 years before the [[historical_continuity_in_Turkey | Turks]] arrived and formed a political entity within modern [[historical_context_and_analysis_of_turkish_literature_and_culture | Turkey]]'s borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>, connecting them to ancient Urartians or claiming their ancestors conquered vast territories is considered an oversimplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Alphabet and Literacy in Ottoman Balkan Nations

Before gaining independence, nations like Albanians, Serbs, Bosnians, Bulgarians, and Macedonians generally did not have established written alphabets for their languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>.
*   **Slavic languages**: Were primarily oral during Ottoman rule. Clergy, mostly Greek, used Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. A Slavic written literature had begun before the Ottoman conquest (1300s-1400s), but largely ceased until the 19th-century Slavic renaissance (1820s-1830s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>.
*   **Croatians**: Were not under Ottoman rule and primarily wrote in Italian, German, Hungarian, or Latin, being part of those cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>.
*   **Bosnians**: As Muslims within the Ottoman Empire, mostly wrote in Turkish using Ottoman script, and sometimes in Serbian with Ottoman script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>.
*   **Albanians**: The idea of Albanian as a written language only emerged around the 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. Before that, sporadic correspondence existed from the 16th century, but a widespread written culture was absent until the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:54">[01:48:54]</a>. The modern Latin-based Albanian alphabet was chosen after the Prizren Conference, around 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>.

## The Armenian Alphabet

The [[impact_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Armenian]] alphabet is unique in its precise origin. Invented in 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots from a village in Muş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>, it was not merely an alphabet but a cultural project. Mashtots assembled a team of 12-13 educated young people who translated the Bible and Greek Christian classics into [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian]], creating a vast literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:34">[01:55:34]</a>.

Before 405 AD, Armenians did not have a widespread written language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>:
*   The aristocracy and state administration primarily used a form of Persian, especially for royal decrees and board meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.
*   From the 1st to the early 5th century AD, a significant number of words entered [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian]] from Iranian languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:42">[01:56:42]</a>.
*   The religious institution, separate from the military and state, leaned towards Syriac and especially Greek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. Syriac was used in southern [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian]] provinces, and Syriacs had strong Greek influence, learning Greek as the language of higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.
*   The "Saint Translators" (Mashtots's team) primarily translated from Greek, not Syriac, due to the prevalence of Greek culture in Istanbul, a world cultural capital at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>.

The linguistic landscape of early [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian]] society shows a clear divide: the military and nobility were heavily influenced by Iranian languages (with many noble names being Iranian Parthian), while the church and intellectual sphere gravitated towards Greek and some Syriac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>.

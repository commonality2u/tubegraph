During the final period of the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman Empire]], many Armenians adopted surnames such as Pastırmacıyan (from *pastırma* - cured meat), Deveciyan (from *deveci* - camel driver), Nalbantyan (from *nalbant* - farrier), and Terziyan (from *terzi* - tailor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Other common surnames included Boduryan (from *bodur* - stunted/short), Boşgezenyan (from *boşgezen* - idler), and Çolakyan (from *çolak* - one-armed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Absence of Surnames

Prior to the late 18th century, it was very rare for Armenians in the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman Empire]] to have surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Only the aristocracy, elite, and notables possessed surnames from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For the common person, identification was typically by their given name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas," mirroring the naming conventions for Turks at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Surname Revolution of the 1820s

Beginning around 1820, all Armenians rapidly acquired surnames, and from that point, they became known by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This significant shift, termed the "Armenian surname revolution" or "surname reform," lacks extensive academic publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## [[impact_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Impact of Turkish Language on Armenian Surnames]]

Almost all of the surnames adopted during this period were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This was largely due to the linguistic landscape of the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman Empire]] in 1828, where Turkish was the mother tongue of the overwhelming majority of Turkish Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

While a significant educational campaign in the 19th century helped revive Armenian as a cultural language, in the 1820s, many Armenians either did not know Armenian at all or used it only in church or specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Even if Armenian was spoken at home, Turkish was the common language for public interaction, especially in marketplaces within [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman]] borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Therefore, for a surname to be declared to neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks) and written down, it needed to be in the public language, which was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

In the first quarter of the 19th century, the vast majority of Armenian surnames were either [[professional_and_characteristic_names_in_armenian_surnames | professional names]] or based on personal characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While a few adopted their father's name as a surname (e.g., Sarkisyan, Hagopyan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, many acquired titles like "loquacious," "lame," or "toothy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Armenians were often associated with specific professions like shoemakers, tailors, or traders, unlike Turks who typically had official duties or were villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This led to a preference for profession-based surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Later Influences

Towards the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, under the influence of modern nationalism, some Armenian families with Turkish surnames changed them to Armenian equivalents, such as "Kenvosgeriyan" for jeweler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. However, the truly old Armenian surnames primarily remain Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Interestingly, [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames | Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames shortly after the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman Armenians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A notable difference is that [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames | Iranian Armenian]] surnames typically end with "-yant" (with a 't' sound) instead of "-yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, reflecting a cultural difference between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

> There is a significant lack of published academic work on the "Armenian surname revolution" or "surname reform" within the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Ottoman Empire]], indicating a need for doctoral theses on this subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

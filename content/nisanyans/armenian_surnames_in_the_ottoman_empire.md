The adoption and characteristics of [[influence_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Armenian surnames]] in the [[armenian_history_in_istanbul | Ottoman Empire]] reveal significant [[cultural_and_linguistic_shifts_among_armenians | cultural and linguistic shifts]] within the community. Prior to the late 18th century, surnames were uncommon among Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, with only the aristocracy or elite having them from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Common individuals would typically identify themselves by their first name combined with their father's name or place of origin, similar to Turks of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Rapid Adoption and Turkish Influence

A significant change occurred around the 1820s, when Armenians rapidly began acquiring surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. From that period onwards, they became known by these new surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Nearly all of these newly adopted surnames were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon is largely attributed to the linguistic reality of the time:
*   **Dominance of Turkish** The overwhelming majority of Turkish Armenians in the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Ottoman Empire]] spoke Turkish as their mother tongue in 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Limited Armenian Usage** In the 1820s, a large percentage of Armenians either did not know Armenian at all or used it only in specific contexts like church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Public Language** Even for those who spoke Armenian at home, Turkish was the common language for public conduct and commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There were no public markets within the Ottoman borders where Armenian was spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For surnames to be declared and recognized by neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks, etc.), they needed to be in the public language, which was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Types of Surnames

The vast majority of Armenian surnames adopted in the early 19th century were derived from two main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:

*   **Professions**: Many surnames were based on [[armenian_professions_and_surname_origins | professions]], reflecting the common occupations of Armenians. Examples include:
    *   Pastırmacıyan (from `pastırmacı`, cured meat seller) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Deveciyan (from `deveci`, camel driver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Nalbantyan (from `nalbant`, farrier/horseshoer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
    *   Terziyan (from `terzi`, tailor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
    Unlike Turks, who often held official duties or were villagers, Armenians typically had a specific profession, leading to the adoption of professional names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Personal Characteristics**: Surnames were also formed from physical or personal traits. Examples include:
    *   Bodur Yan (short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Boşgezenyan (loquacious, literally "empty walker") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
    *   Çolakyan (lame) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
    *   Dişliyan (toothy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
    *   Uzunyan (tall/long) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

A smaller number of surnames were patronymics, like Sarkisyan or Hagopyan, derived from a father's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Later Changes and Nationalism

While the "old" [[influence_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Armenian surnames]] were predominantly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, a shift occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Under the influence of modern nationalism, some families with Turkish surnames changed them to Armenian ones, for example, a family named `Kuyumcuyan` (from `kuyumcu`, jeweler) might change it to `Kenvosgeriyan` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This coincided with a "great educational campaign of the 19th century" that revived Armenian as a cultural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_ottoman_and_iranian_armenian_surnames | Comparison with Iranian Armenians]]

Interestingly, [[comparison_between_ottoman_and_iranian_armenian_surnames | Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames after a short period, following the trend set by Ottoman Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The main difference lies in the suffix used: Iranian Armenian surnames typically end with "yant" (with a 'T' sound), whereas Ottoman Armenian surnames end with "yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This distinction reflects the broader [[cultural_and_linguistic_shifts_among_armenians | cultural differences]] between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Research Gap

Despite the significance of this "surname revolution" or "surname reform," there is a notable lack of academic publications or doctoral theses on the subject of [[influence_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Armenian surname origins]] and their evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

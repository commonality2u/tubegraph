## The Legacy of Atatürk and its Societal Impact

### A Deep-Rooted Social Disease

The speaker identifies a social disease in Turkey, rooted particularly in the 1930s, where individuals lacking "moral anchor," "cultural depth," and "richness as a person" have unfortunately occupied critical points in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This is not a new phenomenon tied to any single regime, but rather a symptom of long-standing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### The "Regime of Terror" (1923-1938)

From 1923 to 1938, Turkey lived under a "regime of terror" where people were constantly terrified and uncertain of their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. During this 15-year period, there was an pervasive expectation that freedom would come with the death of the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. However, when the leader died on November 10, 1938, a "very strange" phenomenon occurred: people lost their honor and buried their personalities, unable to overcome their fear and shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This psychological damage, characterized by an inability to speak freely, is considered the fundamental starting point of the social disease known as Kemalism or Atatürkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This period saw a suppression of consciousness, pushing fear into the subconscious, which continues to affect society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Similar fears and dictatorial regimes existed in the Soviet Union during Stalin's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> and in Germany during Hitler's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. These dictators were considered unquestionable and above all law, exercising absolute power including personal desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. In Germany, Hitler's defeat and suicide aided society in overcoming the trauma, albeit imperfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. In the Soviet Union, Stalin was symbolically "buried" three years after his death, a step towards self-criticism, though done "in a low voice and hypocritically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Post-Atatürk Era: Attempts to Bury and Resurrect

In Turkey, during the İnönü period, there were significant efforts to make Atatürk forgotten and to erase him from the historical and political stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. His photographs and pictures were removed from money, and the construction of a monumental grave was halted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Atatürk monuments were merely repaired, and his presence faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

However, with the prospect of government change in 1950, a deliberate policy was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Instead of openly discussing the past, which both parties deemed too dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, they sought to "put the past in a museum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This led to the passing of an Atatürk protection law, the construction of his tomb, and his transformation into a national symbol and a kind of pantheon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. His image was returned to money with the hope that he would gradually be forgotten, becoming a symbol emptied of its original content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Atatürk as a "Loyalty Test"

Over time, Atatürk was resurrected from his grave and used as a mechanism to create division and an internal enemy within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. A mythology surrounding Atatürk, becoming increasingly absurd, was transformed into a "halo of holiness," serving as a loyalty test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Advancement in careers, such as becoming a university associate professor, governor, or minister, became dependent on demonstrating loyalty to Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. This was evident in the 1960s and again in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

### The Fiasco of the Turkish Republic

The speaker suggests that the primary reason why the "great experiment" of the Republic of Turkey—the project of creating a modern state from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire—ended in a "great fiasco" within 100 years, is the society's failure to confront the reality of Atatürk and his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This is a deeply considered idea, not merely a provocative statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

## A Case Study in Suppression: Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's "A Bitter Story"

The discussion highlights Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's 1945 book, *A Bitter Story*, as an "astonishing" text that subtly reveals the psychological suppression of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.

### The Unspoken Truth of Vedat's Fate

Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil, a symbol of the Ottoman aristocracy and a highly cultured individual, was Atatürk's cousin-in-law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. His son, Vedat, was a guest at Çankaya mansion multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. Rumors at the time suggested that an incident involving Vedat led to the permanent estrangement between Latife Uşaklıgil (Atatürk's wife) and Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. Vedat was subsequently sent to Istanbul and later given a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Atatürk's instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. Despite believing himself a bright diplomat, he faced numerous difficulties, culminating in his apparent suicide in 1937 while serving at the Albanian embassy in Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

Halit Ziya's book is written with the pain of this tragedy, making an extraordinary effort to protect his son's reputation and honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. However, a closer reading reveals an attempt to protect himself more than his son, as even a single misinterpreted word could have severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. The book details the injustices Vedat faced, which led to his life darkening and ultimately suicide, yet it provides no information about the nature or reasons for these injustices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>. For instance, the book attributes Vedat's despair and suicide to being dismissed from a first secretary position or being recalled from an embassy, which are presented as disproportionate causes for such extreme reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

### The Culture of Fear and Self-Censorship

The book's most striking feature is its complete omission of the widespread rumors about Vedat that were common knowledge in Turkey at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. The fact that these rumors are not mentioned even once makes the book "a very strange work," indicating deep self-censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. The author laments his son's ruin without naming who ruined him or why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

Even when Vedat sought his father's help to speak with Atatürk, Halit Ziya had to go through a close family friend, Hasan Rıza Soyak, the Secretary General of the Presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. Soyak advised against a direct meeting, suggesting a petition instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. Despite Atatürk's order for Vedat's return to the ministry, he continued to be mistreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. The book never identifies those who crushed Vedat despite Atatürk's consent, showcasing the pervasive fear that prevented open discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. This story illustrates the tragedy of a man crushed between his son's honor and his own helplessness, under the shadow of a regime where open criticism was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>.

## Broader Historical and Cultural Reflections

### The Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations Idea

The concept of an "Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations" is proposed as an idea that should play a leading role in Turkey's long-term national planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. However, it cannot be established on the basis of "primitive and fanatic Islamism" or "myths of Ertuğrul and Abdulhamid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>. The historical Ottoman Empire was not such a place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>; it was, in fact, a continuation of Byzantium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:38">[01:44:38]</a>. Establishing an empire based on Islamic superiority in the 21st century is considered "stupidity and ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>, as it couldn't even be maintained in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>.

Despite this, Turkey possesses key conditions for success in such a regional role, including land size, central location on trade routes, and organizational capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:46">[01:45:46]</a>. Such a project would be beneficial for everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a> and is considered "perhaps the most interesting book that can be written on political and strategic issues in Turkey today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. This directly relates to [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | cultural and historical narratives in Turkey]].

### The Question of Kurdistan and Historical Narratives

A common misconception is that the Kurdistan region, with its lower per capita income, is a hindrance or a reason for Turkey's backwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:12">[01:53:12]</a>. This idea is fundamentally wrong because Kurdistan's contribution is measured by how much "Turkish capital" profits from the region, not solely by the income of its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>. The exploitation of the eastern provinces has played a "very important role in the growth and strengthening of Turkish capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. Without these provinces, Turkey would be a much smaller country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:28">[01:54:28]</a>. The expansion of sovereignty increases "power synergies" and organizational capacity, which is why states always seek to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>. This touches upon [[turkish_historical_perspective_on_ethnic_and_language_issues | Turkish historical perspective on ethnic issues]] and [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | ethnic identities]].

The idea that "invaders did not want to take this region" is also incorrect; the establishment of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq was clear from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. While the question of establishing a Kurdistan came to the agenda, no one took it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:33">[01:55:33]</a>. The possibility of such a country with no sea access, surrounded by four historical enemy powers, and lacking historical unity or a ruling class, was considered non-viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:42">[01:55:42]</a>. The region had no common political will, being governed by separate principalities and tribes with stronger tribal consciousness than national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:11">[01:56:11]</a>. England and France, redesigning the Ottoman Empire's ruins between 1914 and 1923, considered many possibilities and concluded that the current solution was the most correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. The idea of Kurdistan was dismissed, as illustrated by the case of Colonel Noel, whose advocacy for it was disregarded by the British Foreign Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.

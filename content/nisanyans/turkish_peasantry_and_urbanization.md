The historical understanding of Turkey's population, particularly regarding its rural and urban demographics, is often subject to misconceptions. While some might assume a predominantly peasant society, contemporary data indicates a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Peasant Population Decline

As of today, the peasant population in Turkey has fallen below 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This contrasts with a common perception that the majority of the population are peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Urbanization and Societal Manners

Contrary to the claim that Turkish people are "uncouth," the speaker asserts that they are generally well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, a specific segment, the nouveau riche class, is noted as being "extremely uncouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Challenges of Adapting to City Culture

[[Impact of migration on urban centers in Eastern Anatolia | Newly urbanized parts of Turkey]] have experienced significant issues with individuals adapting to city culture after leaving village life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The speaker, however, places the blame not on those with village roots, but on the moral and cultural decay of the elite class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This elite class is described as having the responsibility to guide and set ideals for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Real Problem: The [[Role of educated classes in Turkey | Educated Classes]]

The fundamental issue facing Turkey is identified as the poor education of its [[Role of educated classes in Turkey | educated classes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Failure in Elite Education

The Republic of Turkey's most significant failure in education has been its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:02:00]</a>. While there was success in providing basic education to large masses, particularly after 1950 with primary schools opening in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:15]</a>, this is deemed insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:27]</a>. A society requires an elite group to lead and shape its intellectual landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Historically, the only opportunities for elite education came from a few schools established during the [[Ottoman modernization and westernization | Ottoman period]], many by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:03:05]</a>. The Republic of Turkey did not foster their development; instead, their numbers and budgets decreased, leading to their confinement to limited areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:25]</a>.

Consequently, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in Turkey have gradually declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:37]</a>. Achieving this level of education is now largely limited to a small, fortunate minority who study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:45]</a>. Those educated abroad often struggle to adapt to local conditions upon their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:17]</a>.

### The State of Domestic Education

The domestic education system is critically described as a "stupid brainwashing program" that teaches how to be a civil servant and to show deference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:41]</a>. This system has failed to produce a modern elite class capable of guiding and influencing the general populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Public Thirst for Knowledge

Despite these educational shortcomings, the general public demonstrates a profound desire for wisdom and culture, particularly among the Anatolian people, who show immense love and respect for scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:36]</a>. This thirst for knowledge extends to fundamental issues, especially religious ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:33]</a>, and a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives if presented seriously and lovingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:47]</a>. Topics such as the universe, existence, Turkish history, [[Social and Sociological Changes in Turkey | social structures]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Ethnic and cultural changes in Eastern Anatolia over time | Kurdish issues]], and the Syrian issue are met with great curiosity and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:38]</a>.

If the Westernized and limited elite cannot provide this intellectual service, people turn to religious figures like teachers and pilgrims (Hacı Hacı) for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:35]</a>. However, elite religious education has also been obstructed, leading to a significant decline in the quality of Islamic religious experts compared to the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:07:03]</a>.

## The Half-Educated Elite

A particularly concerning segment of Turkish society, estimated at 1 to 2 million people, is described as "half-educated Turks" who consider themselves "white." These individuals exhibit ignorance, moral degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:28]</a>, a lack of social responsibility, and no instinct to teach or give to others, prioritizing personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:50]</a>. They are considered a "scourge" on Turkey morally and culturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The speaker attributes this not to their personal fault, but to the education system that fails to instill a mission of guiding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:17]</a>.

Above this group, there is an even smaller contingent of "real elites" (around 50,000 people) who are "terribly alien" to Turkish society. They lack vision and hope, with their primary aspiration being to leave Turkey as soon as possible, often by sending their children abroad, which is seen as a national tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:56]</a>.

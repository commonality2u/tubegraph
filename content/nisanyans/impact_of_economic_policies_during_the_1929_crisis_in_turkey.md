The global economic crisis of 1929 profoundly affected [[political_and_economic_challenges_in_turkeys_history | Turkey]], which was still recovering from the First World War. The crisis led to a rapid depletion of capital, loss of value, cessation of investments by businesses, and a widespread wave of unemployment and hopelessness across societies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

## Initial State of the Turkish Economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>

By 1929, [[historical_context_of_1930s_turkey_and_social_implications | Turkey]] had begun to recuperate from the First World War and was attempting to gradually stimulate its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. However, the existing private sector was largely exhausted, ineffective, and ultimately went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

## Policy Responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>

In response to the crisis, the Turkish leadership adopted several fundamental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. These measures were not unique to [[impact_of_major_historical_figures_on_turkish_politics | Atatürk]] or [[political_changes_in_turkey | Turkey]], as similar approaches were implemented across other European countries, including Hungary and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

The primary policies included:
*   **State-led Investment** The state stepped in to undertake investments at a time when private investment had ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. While the profitability of these ventures was uncertain, they offered a solution to the unemployment crisis to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. The United States also implemented similar policies during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   **Import and Export Controls** The government introduced strict controls over imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.
*   **State Takeover of Businesses** As the private sector collapsed, the state assumed control of business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

## Ideological Stance and Outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>

The Turkish government's initial stance was that these interventions were temporary and necessitated by the crisis, with no long-term intention for the state to permanently control the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. However, some intellectuals within the regime's upper management cadres advocated for a new statist and totalitarian economic order, citing models from Germany and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. These suggestions were generally not taken seriously by the Turkish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>.

The outbreak of [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | World War II]] immediately after this period prevented any immediate liberalization of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. It was only after 1946 that economic activity gradually reverted to its natural course, and the state's involvement in the economy was reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. The policies implemented by [[impact_of_major_historical_figures_on_turkish_politics | Atatürk]] during this period are regarded as logical, inevitable, and well-executed crisis management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

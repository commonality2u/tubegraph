[[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] played a role in the significant [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syrian conflict]] outcome, which saw major global powers experience either victory or defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This event is considered a milestone in 21st-century history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Involvement and Strategic Position
The resolution in [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]] was achieved through a compromise involving the United States, Russia, [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]], Iran, and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]]'s active involvement has been reported in the world press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, it is suggested that [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] was "forced to adapt" to the situation rather than leading the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The prevailing impression in [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] was that the outcome was a success for Tayyip Erdoğan's policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

[[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] appears to have accepted and supported a scenario where Tahrir al-Sham would be victorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Aligning with the winning side (the American-Israeli alliance) was a wise choice for [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]], as there was no other viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Outcomes and Perceived Gains for Turkey
[[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] seems to have gained a "certain advantage, albeit a small one" from the [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syrian conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The share given to [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] in the [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syrian]] incident is considered "quite small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Specific areas of influence for [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] include the militia forces under its control, such as the Free [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syrian]] Army, which are effective in Azaz and Afrin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. There is also a possibility of capturing Manbij, a long-standing tactical goal for [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This means [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] "will have a share in the table of reconstructing [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

However, it is noted that [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]]'s role in the "great victory of the American-Israeli front in [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]]" is "quite small" and "marginal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Consequently, the gains [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] will collect are not expected to be "very serious and very comprehensive and large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Prospects
### The Kurdish Question
One significant outcome is the understanding that [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]] will likely have a structure with at least two regions, including a largely independent Kurdish region east of the Euphrates, akin to Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The speaker, who previously did not believe in a future for [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]] Kurdistan, admits being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The Kurds are expected to have an "important role in the new [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> and will be one of the two main players at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

This development means [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] "will have to compromise with this new formation in [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]]" and accept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The speaker finds it difficult to foresee how Syrian Kurds might gain access to the sea due to [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]]'s control over Azaz, Afrin, and potentially Manbij <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. If Kurds gain a powerful role as part of [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]]'s ruling coalition, they *could* reach the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

The policy of "Turkish racism" or "Turkish nationalism" is identified as the basic instinct of secular Kemalist people, leading them to prefer support from jihadist groups over a democratic Kurdish regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This stance is compared to the Ottoman Empire's policy during World War I of trying to keep Turks and Arabs together as "one nation, one state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Refugee Return
There is an intention from [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] and the West to send back some of the [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syrian]] refugees, especially those without professional skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Some reverse migration is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Analysis of Turkish Foreign Policy
Despite the public discourse, it is believed that there are "smarter people in the background" within [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]]'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intelligence, and the Beştepe Palace who can think rationally and systematically about [[international_relations_and_geopolitical_shifts_involving_turkey | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. They are described as "not as stupid a team as it seems" in managing [[international_relations_and_geopolitical_shifts_involving_turkey | Türkiye]]'s foreign relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

However, [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]]'s foreign relations suffer from "very obvious restrictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. While [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] has potential, it lacks many tools to realize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Without "big money, big sources of income and some indispensable strategic advantages," it is "very difficult to follow strong foreign policy and playmaker policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Regarding President Erdoğan, he is seen as a "political genius" in tactical terms, excelling at short-term passes and leading the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. He is praised for his ability to take positions according to the situation and his high tactical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. His continuous success over 20-22 years is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It is stated that it "seems impossible for [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]] to defeat Tayyip Erdoğan" domestically, as he has been "dragged into a great foreign adventure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.# The Role of Turkey in the Syrian Conflict

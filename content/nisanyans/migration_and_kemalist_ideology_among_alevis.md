Kemalism, while widespread in Türkiye's coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, also has significant social bases in inland regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. One of these primary social bases is the Alevi community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32">[02:32]</a>.

## Alevis and the Appeal of Kemalism

[[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye|Alevis]] are identified as a core group strongly supporting Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32">[02:32]</a>. For them, especially in the present day, the Kemalist symbol functions as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53">[02:53]</a>. It represents an ideology that they perceive as countering historical disregard, ignorance, and exclusion from the state and citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>. Through Kemalism, Alevis assert their claim as the rightful owners of Türkiye and its state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>.

## Historical Homeland and Forced Migration

The traditional homeland of [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye|Alevis]] is concentrated in inner Eastern Anatolia, specifically regions like Sivas, Malatya, and Tokat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>, where the Alevi population was historically dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>.

However, since the 1980s, Alevis in these regions have faced systematic oppression, leading to a significant exodus from their ancestral homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>. Consequently, there are now almost no Alevis remaining in areas like Sivas and Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

### Migration Patterns

Many Alevis migrated to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>. A substantial portion also moved internally within Türkiye, settling in major cities such as Istanbul and Ankara, as well as the Aegean region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>.

## Kemalism as a "Last Holdout"

In their new settlements, Alevis continue to embrace Kemalist thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>. This adherence is described as their "last holdout" or their only hope to avoid further oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. The rationale behind this perspective is understandable and considered humane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>, particularly given their history of marginalization.

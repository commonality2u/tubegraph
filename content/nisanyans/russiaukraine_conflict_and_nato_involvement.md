From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The current conflict is framed not merely as a war between Russia and Ukraine, but as a war between Russia and the [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | Western alliance]], specifically [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]], led by the United States and its satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Western Propaganda and Public Opinion
Western public opinion, particularly in Turkey, is largely engaged in repeating "propaganda headlines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These headlines include simplified theses such as "Putin must have gone crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, questions about invading an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, and criticisms of bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The speaker questions the concept of "inviolable borders of independent states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> and challenges why individuals easily accept the narrative of [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | a military alliance]] that has been "the pioneer and leader and the main actor of all kinds of meanness and dishonesty in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

While acknowledging the tragic loss of life, destruction, and refugee crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, the speaker asks how the situation reached this point and if it "started all of a sudden yesterday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Historical Context: Post-Soviet Era
Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet Union, described as the "Russian Empire," was liquidated almost completely peacefully, without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This involved the departure of satellite states in Europe, notably the unification of East and West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, and the surprisingly quick and peaceful dissolution of the 15-republic Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This event is considered unprecedented, where a great world empire surrendered without fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

In the early 1990s, Russian society had a dream of being "accepted by the West," embraced, helped, and guided towards establishing democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Russia saw itself as a natural part of European civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. During a "big honeymoon" period between 1991 and 1995, Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> requested Russia to join [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

However, this expectation was not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The Western world, especially Americans, Germans, and others, "swooped down on Russia with an army of looters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This involved adventurers, robbers, opportunists, swindlers, and scammers exploiting Russia's natural resources, industrial products, industrial facilities, art collections, treasures, and even women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Russian society, including elements of the old Communist Party and police regime, also participated in this looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This period exposed Russian society to "the ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Towards 1998, Russian society began to resist this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The resistance involved Russian oligarchs, sometimes referred to as Russian mafias, who used "violence when necessary," including fists and bullets, to liquidate the looting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This was met with a "violent reaction in the Western world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, claiming Russia was not democratic or lawful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Western Policy and Escalation
The speaker suggests that American rulers sought to "take Russia hungry" and break it apart, similar to the Soviet Union's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The spark point for this was Chechnya, where Islamic militants, trained abroad and pushed from Turkey, were sent to start a guerrilla war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The hope was that if this succeeded, similar movements would arise in other Russian regions like Tatarstan, Crimea, and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

When Vladimir Putin was elected in 2002, his duty was to fight against this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Russia managed to calm Chechnya by 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, a move the Western world "never forgave Putin" for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Similar efforts to instigate Islamic guerrilla movements failed in Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Later, through Turkey, efforts were made to include Georgia in [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] and organize its police and army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Fanatic Georgian nationalism was encouraged, leading to policies of "massacre and encouragement" against other nations living in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Georgia even began expelling some groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Russia attacked Georgia in response, in a war that lasted about a week, after which Georgia "never recovered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

The speaker identifies a shift in American policy:
*   **Pre-1995:** An "extremely positive and extremely friendly approach towards Russia" during the Bush administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Post-1995/96:** During the Clinton period, a "political movement called those issues" and a "bureaucratic movement" began to be heard in Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Post-2000:** These individuals, who "insistently defended the idea that Russia was an enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, came to dominate American foreign policy with "crazy self-confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This group is described as "sick of power" and "not bound by any home moral principles other than prejudice and arrogance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, influenced by "seventy-year-old anti-communist anti-virus propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]'s Evolving Role
[[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] was established in 1949 to combat the Soviet Union and limit its hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Logically, after the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991, [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] had "no reason to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. However, as a "huge organization" that supports a tremendous staff and industries (arms, propaganda, research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, its sole purpose became to maintain its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

Consequently, [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]'s "enemy definition was slowly shifted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Starting around 1997, [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] began to expand its area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>:
*   **First expansion (1991):** The unification of Germany, which included East Germany into a [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] member (West Germany), was allowed based on an agreement with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Second stage (1995/97):** Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary joined [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, despite assurances that they would only join the EU, not [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Later expansions:** Three Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), historically created by Germany as "a spear directly directed at the heart of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. These countries were seen as strategically positioning [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] near Russia's vital strategic cities and Baltic Sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Bulgaria, Romania, and parts of Yugoslavia were also added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Ukraine's Role in the Conflict
Since 2008, the inclusion of Ukraine in [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] became an agenda item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. When the Ukrainian administration resisted, a coup in 2014 brought Ukraine into [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]'s sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This led to a "bloody conflict as much as today's War" in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The speaker asserts that the "Ukrainian people" did not instigate the 2014 events, but rather "a few hundred thousand people" gathered in the square, while the majority (43-44 million) watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Promises of visa-free travel to London and Paris were used to "seize Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

Thirty percent of Ukraine's population is Russian or has close ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. These populations desired freedom to travel to Russia and were not seeking alliance with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Their demands were suppressed, leading to street clashes in Odessa where people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. The provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk were suppressed "with fire and blood," resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, including civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

In recent years, the Western world increasingly insisted that Ukraine would join [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] and declared their military readiness "against Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. They sent fleets to the Black Sea, showing force despite international agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Russia's Stance and Warnings
Russia's approach since the early 2000s, at least since 2008, has been clear: "You will not and cannot include Ukraine in [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Ukraine is considered "a part of our historical homeland" and has been part of Russia for years, with a significant Russian population and integrated economic, communication, cultural, and infrastructural assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Russia stated it would not hand Ukraine over to a military power that considers Russia an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

Several "sane people" in America and Europe, including George Kennan (the theorist of the first Cold War), warned against this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. In 1997, Kennan stated that [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] expansion towards Russia was "suicide," "madness," "stupidity," lacked logical defense, and would lead to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. Many other experts in military, diplomatic, and academic fields also warned that this policy was "madness and will lead to war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

The speaker concludes that "the person responsible for this war is the one who planned this war, the side that caused this war knowingly and willingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The "threat of violence is as dangerous as violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>; if one is cornered and harassed, they are forced to defend themselves, often using "ugly methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. This is what happened in the [[current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_nato_and_russia | Russia-Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

## Western Hypocrisy and Past Interventions
The speaker highlights the hypocrisy of Western countries condemning Russia for bombing an independent country, given their own history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Serbia (1998):** NATO bombed Serbia for weeks and months to create an independent Kosovo run by "drug trafficking gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Iraq (2002):** Iraq was destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan:** Invaded and destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Syria, Yemen, Libya:** Also destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
The speaker refers to the Western powers as a "gang of gangsters" and "bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

## Outlook on the War and Geopolitical Dynamics
### Pyrrhic Victory for Russia?
The possibility of the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Ukraine War]] being a Pyrrhic victory for Russia is strong, meaning Russia could suffer "very heavy damage" even if it wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### Germany's Position and Underestimation of Russia
Germany's expectation is not to do business with Russia's "current regimes" and "introverted and nationalist administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. They aim to "bring down this administration at all costs and at the cost of destroying Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. However, this approach is based on underestimating the enemy, a common mistake that leads to major wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Historically, attempts to easily defeat Russia by Napoleon (1812), the Ottoman Empire (1877), and Hitler (1941) all ended in "great disappointment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

### Zelensky's Leadership
Zelensky's leadership in the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Ukraine War]] has been described as "Çetinceviz" (a tough nut to crack), surprising those who previously dismissed him as merely an actor or comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. At this stage, overthrowing him via a coup seems difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

### Russia's Military Approach
Russia is making a serious effort to prevent civilian harm in the initial phase of the war, targeting military facilities and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. The Western world's policy, however, aims for the war to last "as long as possible and be as bloody as possible" for propaganda value and to harm Russia economically, diplomatically, and domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. This reflects [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]'s "unlimited aggression and hurting policy," which has lost all moral concerns, long-term records, and historical perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

### Why Ukraine Wants to Join NATO
Ukraine is not an independent state in its decision-making; its institutions and administration are "financed by [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. It is described as a "country that has been seized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

### Fundamental Contradiction Between West and Russia
The fundamental contradiction is that Russia is one of the few remaining geographies where Western capitalism and companies cannot freely operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. Western capitalism desires to freely commodify Russia's industrial resources, products, human capital, and existing values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Currently, Russia and China are the two major military forces resisting this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. The speaker suggests that if India joins this alliance, the West's task will become even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

### The Montreux Agreement and Turkey's Policy
The Montreux Agreement is considered by the speaker to be most positively impactful for Russia, as it places serious restrictions on the entry of warships from third countries into the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. In peacetime, there is a limit to the number of ships that can be brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. If the war escalates and [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] countries are forced to intervene directly, Turkey will face "very heavy pressure" to join the war, potentially using the [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] agreement as leverage against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Turkey's current policy regarding [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] and Russia is deemed successful, correct, and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. This "two-sided" policy, reminiscent of İnönü's approach in World War II, involves seeming close to the West while also engaging with the other side, fulfilling some demands, and diversifying arms purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This diplomatic strategy is considered the best for a country like Turkey that lacks the power to cope with neighboring countries on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

### Propaganda in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]]
The speaker asserts that there is significant Western propaganda, where "no one can compete with the West in terms of the scope of lies they can see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. An example given is the Snake Island incident, where Ukrainian soldiers were falsely depicted as heroes saying "go [ __ ] yourself" before being killed, when in reality, they surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

### Russia as a "Dictatorship"
The speaker challenges the notion of Russia being a dictatorship by asking, "Which country can you provide without a toy in your hands?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. It is argued that Western countries are "extremely organized and extremely captive in the hands of a socratic dictatorship that penetrates every area of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This bureaucratic control is seen as suffocating societies, with political power shrinking as bureaucracies grow stronger worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>. The speaker argues it would be "very bad" if the current Russian government were to be defeated by a "gangster gang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

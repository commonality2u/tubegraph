This article explores significant historical conflicts and events involving the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]] and Greece, focusing on the 1821 Tripolis incident and the broader [[Turkish and Greek historical relations | relationship]] between the two entities.

## The 1821 Tripolis Incident

The events in Tripolis in 1821 are a notable point in the [[Historical context of the Greco Turkish War 1919 1922 | Greek struggle for independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. In March 1821, a major national revolt began in the Peloponnese against the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottomans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

Tripoli (current name: Tripolis), located in the middle of the Peloponnese Peninsula, was the largest city and a significant Ottoman capital in the region, with a substantial Turkish and Muslim population, as well as a sizable Jewish population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. The city was besieged for weeks or months, and upon its surrender, Greek forces massacred approximately 10,000 civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:45">[01:39:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This incident is often recalled as a "dark page" in the Greek national liberation struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>.

### Perspectives on the Massacre

The massacre is sometimes viewed as a consequence of long-standing Ottoman administration characterized by "tyranny, arrogance, injustice, and oppression" against the Christian population in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>. The [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman administration]], similar to later regimes, primarily relied on methods such as police oppression, imprisonment, execution, and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.

Kolokotronis, a leader of the Greek Liberation Struggle, tried to prevent the massacre, expressing shame and self-blame for his inability to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:59">[01:41:59]</a>. However, he also admitted that he wasn't "very upset" given the suffering endured by his comrades at the hands of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>. After capturing the city, Kolokotronis ordered the plane tree in the city square, used for hangings, to be cut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>.

### Aftermath of Tripolis

Following the Tripolis massacre, the entire Muslim population of Moraki (Peloponnese Peninsula), which constituted around 30% of the region's total, fled and sought refuge on the Ottoman side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>. They settled in Thessaly, then in northern Greece, and later, around the 1880s-1910s, many migrated to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>. Families in Turkey with the surname or village name "Moralı" often carry the memory of these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a>.

## Ottoman Administration and Migration

The [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]] had a long history of dealing with various populations, including Albanians and Kurds.

### Albanian Migration and Role within the Ottoman Empire

Albanian Bey (nobility) class members were consistently loyal servants and allies of the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman State]], holding powerful positions within the bureaucracy, military, and religious scholarly classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>. They played crucial roles in governing non-Muslim populations in the Balkans, from southern Greece to Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

Mass migration of ordinary Albanians to Turkey primarily occurred after the Balkan Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. Many Muslim Albanians from areas that came under Christian rule (Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and especially Kosovo) preferred to migrate to Turkey due to perceived inconvenience of living under Christian governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53">[01:47:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. Most Albanians in Turkey today trace their origins to Macedonia, Kosovo, or the Yenipazar Sanjak/Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>. Direct migration from the country of Albania to Turkey was minimal after 1912 but increased slightly after the 1990s and 2000s due to economic and political crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.

### Kurdish Migration and Settlement Policies

Continuous migration from Eastern provinces to Western provinces in Turkey has occurred since the 16th century, extending into the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:56">[01:50:56]</a>. Many Kurds traditionally lived as nomads for centuries, moving between Syria, Iraq, southeastern Turkey in winter, and the Anatolian steppe in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>.

These nomadic Kurdish groups often conflicted with settled agricultural societies, leading to complaints of looting, murder, theft, and invasion of fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>. They also frequently refused to submit to the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman State]] or pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>. Consequently, the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottomans]] periodically engaged in conflicts with these groups and pursued policies to forcibly settle them, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:43">[01:52:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of people from the east, including Turkish, Kurdish, and Arabic speakers, were forcibly settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>.

Kurdish settlements were densely established in Central Anatolia, including Çorum, Kırşehir, the Konya plain (Cihanbeyli, Haymana, Yunak), Çiçekdağı, and Aksaray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:44">[01:54:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>. Many of these settled Kurds, being far from their traditional lifestyle and princely order, assimilated over the last 200 years, forgetting Kurdish and adapting to the dominant culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:41">[01:55:41]</a>.

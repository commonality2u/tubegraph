Global political dynamics are currently marked by significant shifts and conflicts, with traditional norms of international relations being increasingly abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. This environment is characterized by a "law of wolves," last seen in 1938-1939, which now increasingly dominates political actions and state behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:28:05]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Shifts

### Armenia-Turkey-Azerbaijan Reconciliation and Western Influence
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is attempting reconciliation with Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:09:03]</a>. This effort is seen as difficult for a leader of a defeated country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:14]</a>. The reconciliation efforts may also involve appeasing Western circles, including the United States, NATO, and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:10:00]</a>. Historically, Western states, particularly the United States since 1975, have actively fueled the Armenian genocide issue, simultaneously encouraging Armenians to focus solely on it while also promoting a denialist stance among Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:48]</a>. The speaker notes that the Turkish press shifted its narrative from positive portrayals of Turkey to negative ones after 1974, coinciding with Cyprus events and US policy shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:50]</a>.

The Armenian government's recent diplomatic signals to the West, such as the Prime Minister's wife visiting Ukraine, are viewed as a diplomatic obligation to protect against Western sabotage, despite the West having little to offer Armenia militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:15:47]</a>.

### Georgia and NGO Influence
A significant struggle is ongoing in Georgia, where Western countries are openly attempting to overthrow the democratically elected Georgian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:45]</a>. This is happening through overt means like foreign ministers participating in street marches against the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:22]</a>.

The conflict stems from Georgia's decision to confront the issue of NGOs, which have become tools for foreign intelligence organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:18:45]</a>. Originally emerging in the 1980s and 90s as democratic initiatives, NGOs have transformed since the 2000s, with Western intelligence agencies gaining full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:47]</a>. These organizations, financed by the EU, NATO, and the US, are numerous and widely spread, corrupting local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:19:43]</a>. Georgia's government mandated that foreign-funded institutions register as foreign agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:10:07]</a>. The strong negative reaction from Western countries, especially the EU, indicates their loss of control and resort to open street conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:11:46]</a>. This public display, while seemingly a show of force, is actually a sign of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:11]</a>.

### [[geopolitical_dynamics_and_potential_alliances_in_europe | Eastern European Geopolitics]]
Significant events are unfolding in Eastern Europe. The conflict between Hungary and the European Union has escalated to the point of forming an opposing bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:23:04]</a>.

Serbia has taken a major step by signing a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with China, receiving a visit from the Chinese leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:34:04]</a>. This is expected to rapidly strengthen Serbia's position in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:22">[02:42:26]</a>. An unprecedented atmosphere of friendship and cooperation has also emerged between Serbia and Hungary, including plans for a high-speed rail line between Budapest and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:35">[02:44:45]</a>. Historically, Hungary and Serbia have been adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:49:58]</a>.

Slovakia, under Prime Minister Robert Fico, has aligned with this new alliance (Hungary and Serbia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:04">[02:51:12]</a>. Slovakia has declared it will not approve Ukraine's NATO membership and will veto further arms shipments to Ukraine within the EU framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:18">[02:53:43]</a>. Furthermore, Slovakia rejected the World Health Organization's international health treaty, which is seen as a step towards a world dictatorship controlled by America and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:23">[02:55:50]</a>. Following these actions, Robert Fico was shot and is fighting for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:23]</a>. Theories for the assassination include involvement by Ukrainians or a direct order from Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:31">[02:57:04]</a>.

### [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including_the_ukraine_and_gaza | Ukraine Conflict]] and Border Issues
The events in Ukraine are considered very important in the context of the [[historical_and_political_transformation_in_global_power_dynamics | transformation of the global order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:53]</a>. After the Ukrainian government fell into the hands of fascists, a policy of bloody oppression against Russians within Ukraine began, leading to Russian support for rebellion in Donetsk and Luhansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:08:22]</a>. Russia recognized these as separate republics, similar to Northern Cyprus or the Bosnian Serb Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:52]</a>. However, in 2022 or 2023, Russia officially annexed these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:08]</a>. This annexation is considered a first in Europe and likely globally since 1945, breaking the post-1945 international order that deemed existing borders sacred and annexation by force a major crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:10:02]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the accumulation of tensions and unresolved conflicts on borders worldwide could lead to widespread turmoil, following the path opened by Russia in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:11:18]</a>.

### New Caledonia and the Dilemma of Colonialism and Immigration
A revolution and serious clashes have occurred in New Caledonia between the French administration and indigenous people, resulting in a "bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:28:33]</a>. This situation presents a complex dilemma regarding colonialism and anti-colonialism. The indigenous Kanak people constitute less than 40% of the population, with the majority being settlers from France or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:13">[02:29:50]</a>. France passed a law allowing anyone settled for 10 years to vote, effectively marginalizing the native Caledonians' political authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[03:02:21]</a>.

This raises a fundamental question for European countries and others like Turkey: how to balance the rights of native populations with those of later-settled citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:11:26]</a>. This is a crucial question in countries like France, England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:31:37]</a>. The dilemma questions whether traditional cultural groups, when they become a numerical minority, still retain special rights over the country's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:28">[03:22:25]</a>. Applied to Turkey, this means asking if the "Turkish" population, estimated at 60%, has special rights or if Turkey belongs to all its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:33:03]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics: Turkey
Turkey's internal situation is described as poor, with conditions for safe and humane living having been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:48]</a>. The current government and its head are primarily responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Optimism for internal political options is low, and the current balance of power is believed to be changeable only through bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Those who advocate for passivity are seen as defenders of the existing order, as there's no indication that change can occur through politics, law, or demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

There is a growing irritability in Turkey, especially among the younger generation, which has reached the level of madness, stemming from a fear of being defeated. This is seen as a panic reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:59:58]</a>. The speaker is pessimistic about how this issue will be resolved without widespread bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Historical and Political Transformation in Global Power Dynamics

### Monarchy vs. Democracy in Islamic Civilization
The question of whether monarchy is a sole source of stability and prosperity in Islamic civilization is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:12:31]</a>. Morocco is noted for having a state tradition, unlike Algeria or Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:56]</a>. Egypt, despite greater natural resources and a longer state tradition than Morocco, is less advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:36]</a>. This is attributed to figures like Gamal Abdel Nasser, who is seen as having destroyed Egypt economically, socially, and institutionally by governing with rhetoric and squandering national wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:15:00]</a>.

A comparison between Morocco and Egypt highlights that Morocco's monarch derives legitimacy from birth and ancestry, thus not needing to constantly bribe the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:31]</a>. Egyptian rulers, though also monarchs, must bribe the people to maintain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:16:02]</a>. While Morocco's Sultan Hassan was despotic, his policies served the country's long-term interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:27]</a>. In Islamic countries, monarchies (e.g., Morocco, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait) appear to be more successful than those attempting democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:17:24]</a>. However, establishing a monarchy is not instant; it takes generations to bear fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:49]</a>.

### Influence of Zoroastrianism and Iranian State Structure on Islam
When Islam emerged, it clashed with two major civilizations: the Roman/Byzantine/Greek in the Mediterranean and Iran in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:55]</a>. Islam's intellectual infrastructure, basic concepts, laws, and artistic traditions were overwhelmingly influenced by the Christian and Jewish worlds, including the idea of a single God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:22:02]</a>. Zoroastrianism was in decline and marginalized when Islam arrived, and early Islam viewed Zoroastrianism as infidel, in contrast to the more nuanced view of "People of the Book" (Christians and Jews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:21:56]</a>. Later, some Iranian traditions may have influenced Sufism and the birth of Shiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:33]</a>.

Historically, Iran's major contributions to world civilization include:
1.  **The concept of Satan**: This idea of a powerful evil god, an adversary to the good god, originated in Iranian culture during its first great expansion in the 6th century BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:24:25]</a>. It later passed into Judaism (during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, 5th-6th century BC) and subsequently into Christianity and Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:25:41]</a>.
2.  **Organized and expansionist state religion**: With the Sassanids in the 3rd century AD, Zoroastrianism became an actively propagated state religion, a new concept that influenced the Roman world to adopt Christianity as its own state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:26:58]</a>.

### Ottoman Policies and the Armenian Patriarchate
The establishment of the Armenian Patriarchate by Fatih Sultan Mehmet was a geopolitical move. Before 1442/1444, the Armenian Church had been in chaos for 400 years, with multiple rival centers vying for authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:29:27]</a>. In 1444, a church council in Sis (Kozan, Adana) elected a single Catholicos, whose seat was moved to Echmiadzin Monastery near the Akkoyunlu capital, aiming to unite all Armenians under the protection of the Akkoyunlu (a rising power in Western Iran, Mesopotamia, and Armenia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:30:52]</a>. This was a significant geopolitical event, as Armenians constituted the majority of the population east of the Euphrates and were economically powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:31:29]</a>.

Two years later, the Mamluks in Egypt instigated another Catholicos in Kozan, creating two Armenian religious leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:32:11]</a>. The Ottomans, who had a relatively small Armenian population in their territory at the time (before eastern conquests), also sought to establish their own Armenian ecclesiastical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:40]</a>. Fatih Sultan Mehmet called the religious leader of Armenian masters in Bursa to Istanbul, establishing the Armenian Patriarchate there as an international policy move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:34:06]</a>. In the long term, this served the Ottoman policy of "divide and rule" among Christian communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:25]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | global political landscape]] is characterized by abandonment of traditional diplomatic norms, increasing overt state interference in other countries' internal affairs, and a rise in regional alliances challenging existing blocs. The historical context of power dynamics and identity politics continues to shape [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | regional conflicts]] and internal societal dilemmas, suggesting a future marked by potential upheaval and a redefinition of borders and power balances.

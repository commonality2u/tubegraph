## The Term "Byzantine Empire"

The term "Byzantine Empire" was not used by the Eastern Roman Empire itself. It was a method invented by European intellectuals and Renaissance historians in the mid-16th century to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>. Hieronymus Wolf first used and popularized the term "Byzantine Empire" in an academic field in 1556 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>.

While a medallion from around 1478 shows "Byzantine Imperator" referring to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, this likely meant "Emperor of Istanbul" (Byzantium being the city name) rather than an empire name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">[01:46:30]</a>. The Eastern Roman emperors who reigned in Istanbul, Iznik, and Trabzon never referred to themselves as the Byzantine Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:20">[01:48:20]</a>.

## Ottoman Conquests and Societal Transformation

The Ottoman conquest in Anatolia led to significant societal changes, including large-scale migrations and conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

### Religious Conversion

The conversion to Islam in villages was not primarily due to forced conversions or sudden religious enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. Instead, the Ottoman state's policy of seizing church and public properties significantly weakened the Christian religious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. Monasteries, which previously housed hundreds of monks and provided comprehensive education, withered without income, leading to an "ignorant generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. In contrast, Muslim religious figures like Hodjas and Qadis established schools and madrasahs, offering education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. Religion, being a matter of knowledge and literacy, spread through these new institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

Children primarily acquire their religion; adult conversions are rare and usually driven by rational interest or necessity rather than philosophical enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. The shift occurred gradually as children grew up in a Muslim-dominated educational and social environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

### Migration and Demographics

The Ottoman conquest opened up new opportunities, acting like a "gold rush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Many people, including Turks, Armenians from eastern provinces, Persians, Kurds, Arabs, and even Romani people, migrated to Western Anatolia to take advantage of these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. These migrants, most of whom were Muslim (at least on paper), intermarried with the local population, leading to a mixed populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>. This demographic shift made it difficult to pinpoint specific racial origins, as many traditions and practices continued across different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that race-based historical narratives are "crazy nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

### The "Greengrocers" (Manav)

The term "greengrocer" (Manav) refers to a specific group of people in the Ottoman province of Hüdavendigar, which included Bursa, Balıkesir, southern Çanakkale, Bilecik, İzmit, and Adapazarı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This term is an administrative and legal designation, not an ethnic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. "Greengrocers" were defined as:
*   Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
*   Not "Yoruk," which were nomadic Muslim people without a fixed address, distinct from Turkmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   Not part of the military/ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.

The majority of these "greengrocers" were likely former Byzantine inhabitants of the region who converted to Islam and adapted to the new state's political and administrative conditions, becoming Muslim taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. Their cultural practices, such as specific dishes or celebrations like Hıdrellez, may have roots in pre-Ottoman traditions and are not necessarily indicative of a pure ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. This illustrates aspects of [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | Cultural and Ethnic History in Turkey and the Surrounding Regions]].

## Malazgirt (Manaz Gert)

The town of Malazgirt was known as Manaz Gert before the arrival of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. The suffix "kert" (or "gerd" in Western Armenian) means "city" in Eastern Armenian and Old Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27">[01:42:27]</a>. The name "Manaz" is believed to derive from an Urartian king named Menu (or Menas), who founded the city or was an ancestor of the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>. This historical background predates the [[historical_perspectives_on_turkish_conquest_of_anatolia | Turkish conquest of Anatolia]].

## Historical Progress

History is understood to progress in both a linear and cyclical fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:16">[01:50:16]</a>. While there's a linear progression of technology and accumulated knowledge, there are also periods of significant civilizational collapse, such as the end of late antiquity (5th-6th to 11th-12th centuries) and the Upper Bronze Age civilization (ending 12th century BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>. Despite collapses, knowledge and skills, especially after the invention of writing, are rarely truly lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:45">[01:54:45]</a>. This perspective challenges the 19th-century Enlightenment view of continuous, clear linear progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:29">[01:50:29]</a>.

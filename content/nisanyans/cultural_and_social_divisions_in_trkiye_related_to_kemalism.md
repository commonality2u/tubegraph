Kemalism is widespread in coastal areas of Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, particularly in the Marmara Aegean Region, the coastal parts of the Aegean, and the Western and Central Black Sea regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Its spread into inland areas is supported by two main social bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A third significant base is the [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Social Bases for Kemalism

### Greek Immigrants
Over a million immigrants arrived in Anatolia from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Greece between 1878 and 1913, settling in the Western parts of Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The Republican People's Party and Kemalism are strong among these communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Educated Civil Servants
Kemalism is strong among segments of the population who are considered educated by Trkiye's standards, typically civil servants, even if they have not opened up to global culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This ideology helps distinguish them from the common, or "ignorant," people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

In Trkiye, civil servants often experience career paths that take them to various inland locations like Çorum, Diyarbakır, or Denizli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Upon retirement, many move to cities like Izmir, Antalya, or Bursa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. These cities have a high number of retired civil servants and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For these segments, Kemalism serves as a class indicator, instilling a feeling of being "more valuable people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### The [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi Community]]
The [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi community]], whose historical homeland is in inner Eastern Anatolia (Sivas-Malatya Tokat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, also strongly associates with Kemalism. For them, Kemalism functions as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Despite feeling ignored, disregarded, and excluded from the state and citizenship by certain ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, they view themselves as the "rightful owners of this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Since the 1980s, the [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi community]] has faced systematic oppression, leading many to flee their homes in regions like Sivas and Malatya, where almost no [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevis]] remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Many have migrated to Europe, while a large portion moved to Istanbul, Ankara, and the Aegean region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In these new locations, they continue to embrace Kemalist thinking as their last hope to avoid oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This perspective is considered understandable and humane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Understanding why people are Kemalists requires empathy and distance from conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

However, when considering solutions for Trkiye to move beyond these divisions and "dead ends," a different perspective emerges, often leading to a search for ways to escape and save people from ideological blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

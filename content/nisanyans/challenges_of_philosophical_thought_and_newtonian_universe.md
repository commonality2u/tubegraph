From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of a "Newtonian universe" is explored, particularly in the context of human perception and the nature of reality. Initially, the term itself is questioned, noting that Isaac Newton developed mathematical models for heat and light in the late 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. While 20th-century theories like Relativity and Quantum Mechanics appear to challenge Newton's laws, they are seen as doing so outside an external theoretical framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

It is highlighted that Newton himself was a deeply religious person, engaged in extensive [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | discussions]] about supernatural events, the existence of God, and biblical prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. In the 18th century, it was unlikely for a well-known scientist to be insensitive to religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Beyond the Newtonian Universe: The Unseen Dimensions of Reality

The core question, however, is interpreted as whether the world of objects possesses dimensions beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. It is asserted that there are "many concepts that we cannot grasp, that we do not know, that we do not understand, that we cannot solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This leads to two possibilities:
1.  **Solvable Unknowns**: Information currently beyond human grasp, but ultimately learnable through research and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
2.  **Incomprehensible Unknowns**: Events or phenomena that humans will "never understand," lying outside the realm of perception and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Examples include the beginning and outer limits of the universe, and the "quality of time," which are structurally and conceptually impossible to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Critiquing Explanations of Ignorance

A common pitfall in [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | religious and holy teachings]] is the tendency to attribute unknowns to abstract entities (e.g., "the rainbow dragon created the world," "Zeus created the world") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This is seen as "elevating ignorance to an abstract entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, rather than admitting "we do not know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This approach is described as a "childish love of fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## The "I" as a Non-Newtonian Reality

The "Newtonian universe" question is re-framed as whether the universe is *solely* a system of objects governed by objective, cause-and-effect relationships, reducible to physical, chemical, biological, sociological, and psychological rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. This deterministic view assumes that by studying these interactions, all rules can be perfectly understood, even with advanced tools like artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

However, a counter-argument is posed:
> "No, the world is not made up of this. There is a completely different giant reality outside that crowded objective world, even a reality that is bigger than it. That reality is the reality of me. Consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

This "I" or consciousness, which includes the self of all living beings, acts as a "giant dark point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>, a "negative pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>, and an "area of the unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> that "swallows the whole universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The ability to make choices, imagine non-existent things, speak lies, and perceive past and future (unlike the object world which only exists "at the moment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, demonstrates that humans live in a "non-Newtonian universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

The internal world of consciousness is described as a "darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a> and a "great paradox that is bigger than the whole universe" with no solution and impossible to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. This dilemma is considered fundamental to [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | philosophical thought]], especially in Western philosophy since thinkers like Descartes, Heidegger, and Sartre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Rationality, Morality, and Enlightenment

The discussion extends to the nature of human desires and the role of the mind. All human desires are considered irrational, as the mind's function is to control and critically filter them, not to produce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. People are often guided by feelings, even if they are reluctant to admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### Free Will and Moral Principles
Within the framework of [[philosophical_and_ethical_considerations | moral theory]], universal moral principles are seen as inherent ("factory settings") in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. These "good voices" within a person are contrasted with the "bad voice" that prompts actions against these rules for individual advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Free will is defined as the "obligation to make a choice" between these opposing forces in every action and thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### Enlightenment: Reason vs. Faith
The question of whether a rational, educated person is more "enlightened" than someone living by faith (like Aşık Veysel) is posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. It's argued that [[philosophy_of_rational_thought_versus_faith | education]] increases the likelihood of adhering to the "good voice" because comprehending universal moral rules requires a certain level of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. While faith does not necessarily make one more moral, educated individuals are considered closer to the "better voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The term "intellectual" or "enlightened" refers to a specific social value and class that emerged in 18th-century Europe, claiming to be above classes and states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This class, once highly esteemed, is now seen as collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

## Specialization and Bureaucracy in Academia

The separation of academic fields like history, geography, [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | philosophy]], and psychology, despite their interconnections, is attributed to bureaucratic multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. The need for professors to have titles, desks, faculties, and income sources drives specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. This process involves algorithms creating sub-algorithms and systems working to perfect themselves, leading to the proliferation of sub-systems and a movement away from interdisciplinary approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

## The Concept of the Sacred

The question of why anything should be considered "sacred" in human life, given the apparent ordinariness of everything, is described as a "typical adolescent perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. It is argued that "ordinariness" and "holiness" are not inherent features of objects but are instead matters of perspective and attribution within human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. For example, some see the Kaaba as an "absurd box," while others see it as "the center of the whole universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

It is asserted that almost all great beauties in world history, especially in art, architecture, painting, music, and literature, were created with the feeling of serving "something sacred," whether related to God, religion, or monarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Viewing such creations merely as "a set of colors on a board" is dismissed as a "sterile point of view" that produces nothing and leads to a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## Historical Significance of the Battle of Vienna (1683)

The Polish King Jan Sobieski's defeat of the Ottoman army at Vienna in 1683 is presented as a pivotal moment in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. The Ottoman Empire had been in stagnation for over a century, losing its technological and economic superiority to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. The defeat was devastating, leading to the loss of Hungary in three years and Serbia in ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

The Ottomans' administrative and military control in the Balkans collapsed, and numerous independent principalities emerged within Anatolia, effectively ending Ottoman rule there from 1680 until the Tanzimat period in the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

For Western powers, Vienna revealed that the Ottoman Empire, while still perceived as formidable, was no longer "invincible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. The reason Western states did not fully exploit this weakness and conquer Istanbul was their internal competition and balancing of power, rather than a concerted war against the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. The 1683 incident marked a shift in European foreign policy, where the primary threat was no longer the Ottomans but other European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

## Calvinism and Its Islamic Equivalent

Calvinism, described as a more radical branch of Protestantism, played a significant role in European history during the 16th-18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. Its fundamental difference was its strong anti-monarchical stance, emerging as a rebellion against monarchies and aristocracy and becoming the "main address of the republican movement in the European tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. Key Calvinist strongholds included Switzerland (Geneva, Bern, Tue) and Holland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. In the United States, New England states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island were Calvinist strongholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

A defining feature of Calvinism, particularly Presbyterianism, is its rejection of a senior priestly class in the church; instead, each congregation is a democratic, self-governing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This tradition laid the foundation for American democracy and republicanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

It is suggested that Islam, with its emphasis on the consensus of the *ummah* (community) and the opinion of the *ulema* (scholars), is closer to the Presbyterian/Calvinist understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. From its early days, the Islamic community has tended to reject the authority of a clergy class or administrators, remaining skeptical of state intervention in law and legislation until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. Therefore, it can be argued that Islam possesses a strong Calvinist vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.

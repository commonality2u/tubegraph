Trkiye has a complex history marked by significant political movements and military interventions that have shaped its contemporary landscape.

## Early Republican Coups and Memoranda

The period from the 1960s to the 1980s saw several military interventions in Turkish politics:

*   **March 12, 1971, Memorandum** The military issued a memorandum, leading to the resignation of the Süleyman Demirel government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. This was followed by the establishment of a "reform government" led by Nihat Erim, which included many technocrats and bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This government soon declared martial law and established a regime of terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. Many "progressive" and "Atatürkist" cadres were purged, replaced by individuals like Faik and Sadi Koçaş, described as "police chiefs" and "torturers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **March 9 Coup Attempt** Prior to March 12, there was an attempted "leftist" coup by officers within the army, which was stopped at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. The March 12 memorandum then occurred as a "common platform" coup, after which the leftist elements were eliminated, and a "radical right-wing nationalist group" took control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **May 27, 1960, Coup** A similar pattern was observed during the May 27 military intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. A group advocating for "Atatürkist Officers" to complete Atatürk's task came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. However, within five months, these radical elements were purged, replaced by a "more conservative and static order" aligned with the basic needs of capitalism and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **1980 Coup** These historical events, including the 1980 coup, illustrate a pattern where foreign powers holding influence over the country's strings demand changes in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

### The Role of Foreign Powers and NATO
In a country under NATO control and lacking autonomy in international relations, a "leftist" coup like the imagined March 9 scenario would likely have resulted in a short-lived period of "leftist ideas" before the Republic of Turkey would return to its "factory settings," much like the March 12 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. The historical pattern shows that even if there was a "left-wing coup" or a "left-right coalition coup," they would be cleaned up, and an "old-fashioned Janissary system and order" would become dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## Contemporary Political Landscape and Dynamics

The [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | contemporary political landscape in Trkiye]] continues to be shaped by historical patterns and deep-seated dynamics.

### Election Dynamics
Regarding upcoming elections, the speaker expresses skepticism about the opposition's chances, citing the consistent performance of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (22-26% in 11 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. For a change in voting behavior, voters need a new factor, a "new big hope," or a "new goal" that Kılıçdaroğlu does not embody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

Serious doubts are raised about whether the elections will even be held or be honest, given the presence of an "obvious dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. For a dictatorship to end through elections, strong "trump cards" are needed, such as a major public uprising, military support for change, or a demand from influential world powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. As of the discussion, these conditions are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

### Identity Politics and State Policy
The question of why an Alevi or [[kurdish_political_movement_in_trkiye | Kurdish President]] cannot be elected highlights long-standing [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | social and political dynamics in Trkiye]]. The speaker notes that Turgut Özal, despite being Kurdish, became president by "giving up his identity," meaning his Kurdishness was never highlighted, and he proved his loyalty to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The current government has a "very strong wing of Kurdish origin" in key positions, but the issue is not *being* Kurdish, but rather *defending* or highlighting a collective Kurdish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

Historically, Alevis have been continuously suppressed by the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Kurds, who were once allies against Armenians, have been in continuous conflict with the Turkish state once Armenians were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. This has led to a "genetic memory" within the governing cadres that certain groups, like Alevis and Kurds, cannot be fully trusted in key positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. This exclusionary policy, described as reflecting a mentality from 300 years ago, is seen as detrimental to the country's quality of life and leads to restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms, necessitating dictatorships or coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### Evolution of Political Parties
The AKP (Justice and Development Party) is described as having become a "personal corruption organ of a single person" and is not permanent, expected to leave the stage with Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. The question then becomes who will take over the "robe of the BSP" (dominant party of Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Meral Akşener is seen as seeking this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. There is speculation that cadres from the Republican People's Party (CHP) might switch to a new "big right party" after another election defeat, as it is "human to switch to the party that will win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

The CHP has a "structural weakness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. The speaker had written a detailed report in 1982 arguing for the liquidation of the Republican People's Party, but this did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts and Trkiye's Position

[[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Political developments in Turkey and global geopolitics]] are intertwined, with Trkiye increasingly re-evaluating its alliances.

Trkiye's "drifting away from the Western alliance" is seen as a "rational," "correct," and "smart policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. Leaving a "sinking ship" (Western alliance) is perceived as increasing the likelihood of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. A potential change in government is unlikely to alter this fundamental stance, though the skill of the new government in international diplomacy would be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>.

The Western world is seen as financially exhausted, with limited aid to offer Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. In contrast, countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Qatar offer "solid economic opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. The European Union, in particular, is on the "verge of an unprecedented economic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

The recent Saudi-Iran rapprochement, sponsored by China, is viewed as a "revolutionary event" that will deal the "final blow to American hegemony in the Middle East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. This alliance combines Saudi Arabia's financial power with Iran's population, social cohesion, and military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This rapprochement will provide Iran with financial resources and trade access, radically changing the balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. This is described as "a nail driven into the coffin of the Western alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

Furthermore, there are serious efforts towards establishing a trade and transportation route that would connect China through Central Asian countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran to the Middle East and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. Trkiye is geographically indispensable to this route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. The question remains how long Trkiye can resist or whether it will join this "coming locomotive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>.

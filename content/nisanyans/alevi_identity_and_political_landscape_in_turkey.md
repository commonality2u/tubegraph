Alevism is a distinct and often misunderstood religious and cultural identity in Turkey. It is considered a sensitive topic, partly because the [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi society]] has historically been very closed [04:01]. Outsiders, especially those without serious knowledge, are generally discouraged from making judgments about it [04:06].

## Historical Background and Evolution
Alevism, as it is known today, largely crystallized as a distinct movement in the 1400s, reaching its peak around 1500-1514 [06:45]. It originated from a great revolutionary and protest movement against classical Islam, specifically Sunni Islam, initiated by the Safavid dynasties in Ardabil, Iran [07:30]. This movement, led by figures like Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and Shah Ismail across three generations, interestingly coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe [07:30].

The movement posed a significant threat to the Ottoman Empire, which viewed it as a deadly ideological danger [07:48]. For centuries, the Ottomans ruthlessly suppressed the Alevi movement, crushing it, exiling adherents to the mountains, and killing those declared illegal [09:27]. This suppression, a hallmark of a typical totalitarian state, aimed to destroy Alevism [09:35]. Persecution was particularly violent during the reign of Yavuz Selim and again in the 19th century with the suppression of the Janissary Corps [08:06, 09:50].

As a result, Alevis have historically maintained poor relations with the state, living illegally and often fleeing to remote mountainous regions [10:02]. They were constantly oppressed and compelled to hide their identity and worship secretly [10:19].

## Core Beliefs and Practices
The fundamental characteristic of Alevism is its resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law, and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class [10:50]. It is an eclectic movement that has incorporated diverse elements [25:55].

Alevis reject many of the basic conditions of Islam as defined by the state and Sunni orthodoxy [13:51]. For instance, they do not observe traditional Islamic fasting or pilgrimage, and they reject Sharia rules and zakat [14:06, 14:14, 14:17]. Despite this, they define themselves as Muslim [14:20].

At its theological core, Alevism supports Ahl al-Bayt, meaning they consider the first four Sunni caliphs (Abu Bakr, Omar, and Uthman) illegal, accepting only Ali and the 12 Imams who followed him as the rightful representatives of Islam [15:05, 15:18]. This lineage includes Ali's sons Hasan and Husayn [15:24].

While rooted in Shia themes, the Shah Ismail movement created a "brand new incident" and a new political constellation [16:12]. Unlike Iranian Shiism, which has a strong madrasah tradition, an academic framework, and a mullah hierarchy, [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism in Turkey]] lacks such a centralized, formal structure [16:55]. Instead, it is characterized by decentralized dedes (spiritual leaders) who continue a local shamanic and monastic tradition [17:34].

Alevism exhibits influences from various sources:
*   **Central Asian Turkish traditions:** Some Alevi communities trace their roots to Turkic tribes in Anatolia who resisted full Islamization [11:05, 24:28].
*   **Kurdish traditions:** A significant number of Kurds, who centuries ago were not fully Muslim, joined the Alevi movement, bringing their own local traditions and heterodox beliefs [11:34, 24:38].
*   **Christianity:** The figure of Ali in Alevi mythology shows "obvious effects of Christianity," similar to Jesus, with 12 followers (the 12 Imams), and ceremonies resembling Easter [24:05, 24:15, 24:19].
*   **Pre-Islamic Middle Eastern traditions:** Arab Alevis (Nusayris) in Hatay and Syria have distinct traditions and forms of worship, often seen as stemming from pre-Islamic Middle Eastern practices [13:00, 13:27, 24:40].

The formation of Alevi ideology and institutions appears to have been fed by existing cultural fault lines in Anatolia [18:58, 21:42]. There is a clear geographical overlap between the Alevi-dominated regions (especially the Tunceli-Erzincan-Sivas-Malatya triangle) and areas where earlier religious separatist movements, like the Paulicians, rebelled against the Byzantine Orthodox Church [19:17, 20:16].

## Demographics and Diversity
[[demographics_of_alevis_in_turkey | Alevism in Turkey]] is not ethnically monolithic. Approximately half of the Alevi population identifies as Turkish, often strongly attached to a (sometimes fabricated) Turkmen and Central Asian heritage [11:48, 37:13]. The other half consists largely of Kurds, particularly the [[history and impact of Alevi Kurdish society | Alevi Kurds]], primarily residing west of the Euphrates in regions like Malatya, Sivas, Tunceli, and Erzincan [11:51, 12:23].

Beyond these major groups, [[differences_between_various_alevi_communities | Alevism encompasses diverse communities]]:
*   **Arab Alevis (Nusayris):** Found in Antakya and Hatay, these Alevis have a distinct tradition and are culturally closer to Arab Christians in terms of lifestyle and customs [13:00, 37:57].
*   **Tahtacı Alevis:** Concentrated in the pine forest regions along the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts (from Antalya to Çanakkale), these "forest villagers" are nomadic and historically have not harmonized with the state [38:35]. They have a distinct and primitive culture and often vote for the MHP (Nationalist Movement Party), showing no strong connection to leftism or traditional Islam [39:47].
*   **Abdal Alevis:** Located mainly in Central Anatolia, especially south of Gaziantep, they are known for their involvement in music and entertainment [40:04]. They often define themselves as distinct from other Alevis and are sometimes associated with Romani people, but have a "healthy perspective against the state and the authority of the state" [40:33, 41:03].
*   **Balkan Alevis:** Significant Alevi populations exist in Southern Albania (where Bektashism is widespread) and the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria, representing communities that adopted Islam but retained distinct, heterodox traditions [24:50, 25:20].

The common unifying theme across these diverse groups is their fundamental resistance to the state and its dominant Sunni ideology [41:13, 41:21].

## [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | Political Landscape]] and Alevi Stance
Historically, Alevis have always been in conflict with the state. The Ottoman state's dominant ideology was Sunni Islam, which defined Alevis as "infidels" if they did not conform to its legal and ideological framework [28:43, 29:32, 29:39]. This marginalization meant Alevis were denied a place in mainstream society [29:15].

With the advent of the Republic of Turkey and its secular principles, Alevis found an unprecedented space for recognition [29:48]. Secularism and Atatürk became symbols for Alevis, representing a state where they could, for the first time, claim their rights and participate in public life, including becoming civil servants, police officers, or generals [29:52, 30:03]. For Alevis, Kemalism offered the only means to assert their rightful place and demand a share in the state, standing against the dominant Sunni ideology [30:20, 31:43].

However, this reliance on Kemalism is viewed by some as a "dead end" [32:38]. In a democratic context, Kemalism is often a minority ideology doomed to defeat, unable to achieve its goals by force [32:46, 32:52]. When democracy allows the majority to express itself, the ideology of Sunni Islam tends to dominate, marginalizing Alevis to specific regions like İzmir [32:56, 33:10].

Alevis have explored other political avenues:
*   **1960s:** Some Alevis attempted to engage with moderate right-wing politics within the Justice Party, hoping for political rights and positions, but felt betrayed by Süleyman Demirel [33:19, 33:41].
*   **Turkish Unity Party:** Alevis formed their own party, which initially focused on Alevi interests but rapidly shifted to the left [33:43, 33:56].
*   **[[influence_of_alevism_on_turkish_leftist_movements | Socialist Left (1970s)]]:** The 1970s saw a massive shift of Alevis towards the socialist left [34:09]. Approximately 90% of the revolutionary youth movement in Turkey during this period came from the Alevi community [34:52]. This deep engagement meant that Alevi culture significantly influenced the Turkish leftist movement, manifesting in its folk songs, symbols (like the bağlama), and even male-female relations [35:05, 35:48]. The anti-Muslim stance of the Turkish left is also seen as a direct reflection of the Alevi experience [36:21].

Today, with socialism and the rule of law as less viable political anchors, Kemalism remains the primary "branch" for Alevis to hold onto, despite its limitations [31:03, 31:31, 32:22].

## [[Cultural evolution of Alevi society | Cultural and Social Aspects]]
The [[relationship_between_alevism_and_turkish_identity | Alevi identity]] is complex and multi-faceted. When encountering Alevis, particularly in regions like Tunceli (Dersim), there is a palpable sense of open-mindedness, intelligence, and politeness [41:52, 41:56]. They are seen as having successfully protected themselves from the ideological aggression of the state [42:22].

Many Alevis, especially those adapted to modern life, may not actively feed on Alevism in their daily lives, but their upbringing often instills a critical perspective towards official state narratives [43:08, 43:15]. This foundation helps them question and resist state lies and aggressive statements [43:37, 43:43]. However, there is concern about how long this cultural resilience will last, given the Turkish state's success in assimilating populations over generations [44:09].

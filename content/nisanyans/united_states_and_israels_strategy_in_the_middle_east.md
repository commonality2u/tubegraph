From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

A significant event, described as a "milestone in the history of the 21st century," took place recently in the [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This event is seen as a major victory for one side and a defeat for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The prevailing view is that this outcome was the result of a coordinated strategy by the United States and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Perceived "Big Defeat" for Rivals

The recent events are characterized as a "big defeat" for several key players:

### Russia
Russia is identified as having suffered a significant defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. An underlying agreement between Russia and the United States, possibly involving Türkiye, Iran, and Israel, is suggested to have led to the current outcome in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Russia is believed to have received concessions for not participating in the Syrian struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, and the outcome in Ukraine is presented as mutually pleasing to both Russia and America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

It appears Russia has abandoned its claim as a global player, having lost its last military presence in the [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | Middle East]] (specifically, the Mediterranean) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Even if victorious in Ukraine or Georgia, Russia has seemingly accepted its role as a regional power, with influence primarily limited to its immediate surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The only remaining military presence for Russia outside the former Soviet Union borders is in the Sahel region of Africa, like Mali and Upper Volta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This suggests Russia has lost its ability to be an effective global player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The need for a counterbalance against the "one-way absolutist power" of the United States and the Western military alliance is emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, a role Russia previously held. Russia's reliability as a partner has been severely questioned following these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, indicating it may no longer be able to project strong military force far from its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

### Iran
Iran is also considered to have suffered a "great defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Its long-standing policy since 2001, aimed at establishing an area of influence in the [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | Middle East]], has faced a significant setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Syria was a "key door" for Iran's aspirations to reach the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. With the loss of Syria, Iran's ability to project power beyond its geographical confines has been severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This strategic shift may paradoxically lead Iran towards finding a "modus vivendi" with the United States and even Israel, potentially opening a path to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The strategic threat underpinning Iran's hostility with the Western alliance has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Losing Syria has pushed Iran towards becoming a "small state" or "medium-sized state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### China
China's "Belt and Road Initiative," a major project connecting China to Europe and the Mediterranean, has suffered a serious blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The two key countries in this chain, Turkey and Syria, are now under the control of the NATO/American alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This outcome significantly impacts China's long-term geopolitical ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## The United States' Chess Game Strategy

The speaker initially expressed skepticism about the notion of the United States drifting aimlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. However, it is now evident that the US has been preparing this strategy for several years, executing a "successful strategy that is really worth taking off his hat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The US demonstrated remarkable strategic prowess, likened to chess masters, achieving significant gains "without firing a single bullet and without losing a single soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Execution of the Plan
The plan began around October 9-10, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, and proceeded step-by-step:
1.  **Hamas Attack:** They "turned a blind eye" to or even "encouraged" Hamas's spectacular attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This refers to the events of October 2023, specifically October 9-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
2.  **Elimination of Gaza:** Subsequently, Gaza was largely "eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
3.  **Neutralization of Hezbollah:** Hezbollah, which posed a threat to Northern Israel from Lebanon, was largely "cleared or neutralized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
4.  **Overthrow of Syria:** Finally, Syria, a key player, was "overthrown with a single flick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The speaker acknowledges that this grand strategy was not foreseen by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, admitting to making the mistake of basing analysis on "wrong premises" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## The Winners: United States and Israel

The primary winners of this geopolitical shift are clearly the United States and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. They successfully implemented a regional plan that had been in preparation for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, emerging with significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Turkey's Role
Türkiye gained a certain, albeit small, advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. While the Turkish press emphasizes Türkiye's control and active involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, the speaker believes Türkiye's role in the American-Israeli front's victory in Syria is marginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Türkiye's militia forces (Free Syrian Army) are effective in Azaz and Afrin and have expanded their boundaries somewhat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Capturing Manbij has been a tactical goal for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Türkiye will have a share in the reconstruction of Syria, which is seen as beneficial for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

It is suggested that Türkiye was "forced to adapt" to this operation rather than it being something that inherently suited its interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. In a conflict where the "giants are fighting," the America and Israel alliance defeated the Russia-Iran alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Türkiye wisely chose to align with the victorious side, as there was no other viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Kurds' Gains
The Kurds are identified as major beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Syria is expected to have a structure with at least two regions: a Syrian state centered in Damascus and Aleppo dominated by the HTS and its allies, and a largely independent Kurdish region east of the Euphrates, akin to a "second Kurdistan" like Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The speaker congratulates the Kurds for this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, acknowledging their important role in the new Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Türkiye will likely have to compromise and accept this new Kurdish formation in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

A symbolic event highlighting American support is the alleged invitation of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) leader (identified as YPG/SDF/PDP/Kudu) by Donald Trump to a coronation ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This sends a message of alliance and trust from the US to these forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

This indicates a potential shift in America's recent history of losing wars, suggesting a first-time success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## The Losers: The Syrian People and Stability

The Syrian people are largely seen as the "losers" of this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, though there's a slim possibility of them winning if peace can be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. The possibility of the Alawite population in Western Syria accepting an HTS regime is considered weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

The speaker expresses skepticism about the establishment of a stable central authority in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Historical examples like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Yemen, where overthrowing dictators led to prolonged chaos and division rather than democracy, are cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Re-establishing state authority after the collapse of institutions and the seizure of power by armed groups is one of the most difficult tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. It is believed that such order cannot be re-established "without bloodshed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>, requiring a very strong and intimidating leader capable of using military and police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. Without such a strong hand, Syria risks being divided into "40 pieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.

### Critiques of Common Narratives
The narrative that "Assad was a dictator, and his overthrow is good for everyone" is dismissed as a "stupid talk" and "modern propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The phrase "killed his people" is also criticized as manufactured terminology used specifically for Bashar Assad, similar to how "bombing its people" versus "bombing the terrorists" depends on one's political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. All states, throughout history, have used force to suppress uprisings against their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

The concept of "Islamic terrorists" is also challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. The speaker argues that these are primarily power struggles, and the "ideological cover" (whether Marxist or Islamist) is merely a "decoration" that does not significantly affect the content of the struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Therefore, judging groups based on their declared ideology (e.g., Islamists are bad) is simplistic and journalistic stereotyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the events in Syria, ongoing since 2011, are fundamentally a "fight between Israel and America on one side and Iran and Russia on the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>, where one side has clearly won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

## Reasons for Russia's Withdrawal from Syria

The speaker guesses that Russia's withdrawal from Syria, including the loss of its only Mediterranean port, was part of a broader negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. This likely involved concessions offered by the US in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. The situation is described as a "stick and carrot" approach: Ukraine being the carrot, and Syria being the stick, where Russia was militarily on the losing side with no chance of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Russia's active intervention in Syria carried the risk of direct confrontation with America and potentially starting a World War, which it ultimately did not dare to do on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

The "war drums" rhetoric from European states and American politicians in recent months is now seen as a "very skillful policy" aimed at intimidating Russia, rather than genuinely starting new world wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This intimidation tactic appears to have severely extinguished Russia's desire for further adventures in Syria or NATO countries bordering Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

## Future Outlook

For the **Syrian people**, a short-term increase in migration is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. The intention of Türkiye and the West is to send back some of these Syrians, particularly those without professional skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. Reverse migration is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

For **Kurdistan in Syria**, the speaker now believes it has a future, contradicting his previous stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. The possibility of a sea-bordering Kurdistan is questioned, given Turkish-controlled areas like Azaz and Afrin and the Alawite population further south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. If Kurds gain an active and powerful role in Syria's ruling coalition, access to the coast might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

The prospect of a unified central authority in Syria remains uncertain, with a high likelihood of continued internal conflicts and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>. The speaker implies that a strong, possibly authoritarian, figure will be needed to restore order.

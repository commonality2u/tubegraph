This article examines the complex figure of İsmet İnönü, his intricate relationship with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and his significant impact on the [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkish political landscape]]. It draws insights from an article written in 2018 and subsequent discussions, covering his character, policies, and the broader historical context of his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## İnönü's Character and Early Vision

İsmet İnönü is described not as a megalomaniac or someone with ideological obsessions, but rather as a manager with a low-level vision, or one who disliked discussing grand visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He was often restrained in his impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Unlike Atatürk, İnönü's interest in Western culture and law was sincere, not merely for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He actively fostered a love for classical music, acquiring it in Yemen and making efforts to share it with the people of Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He is credited with almost single-handedly preserving a classical music tradition in Turkey, even if weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

He consistently maintained his distance from Turkism movements that proliferated after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. An old enmity existed between İnönü and figures associated with the Turkish Hearths school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This enmity intensified into a "blood feud" after 1942, when İnönü broke the pro-Nazi structure in Turkey through arrests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. After 1942, Turkism became a main cleavage line in [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Relationship with Atatürk

İnönü shared the values and goals of the revolutionary regime led by Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, he prioritized stability, even disagreeing publicly with Atatürk's reform projects that he felt were moving away from a rational line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Their relationship was complex; İnönü held extraordinary admiration for Atatürk's brilliant intelligence and dominant personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Yet, he was disturbed by Atatürk's alcoholism, debauchery at night, and the way the country was governed through "drunk" decisions made in the late hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. İnönü describes how he would often have to ask Atatürk for instructions the next day, only to be told, "İsmet, do as you wish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This became "unbearable" as Atatürk's illness progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

İnönü played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, he took a moderate stance during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion, which led to his dismissal and political downfall because he dared to contradict Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His speech in parliament in 1937, declaring the Dersim rebellion suppressed and emphasizing the need for welfare and peace, was completely opposite to Atatürk's preferred line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This angered Atatürk, who left the assembly and subsequently replaced İnönü with Celal Bayar as Prime Minister, forcing İnönü to take leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. The "second and real bloody period" of the Dersim operation, a "genocide movement" with tens of thousands killed and families torn apart, was commanded by Atatürk himself, with Celal Bayar's government carrying out the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

After his dismissal, İnönü was effectively erased from public life, with his name becoming dangerous to mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. He was under police surveillance and not seen in public areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. His unanimous election as president the day after Atatürk's death is considered "one of the most fundamental and most striking and enigmatic questions" in the [[historical_and_cultural_discourse_on_ataturkism_and_turkish_society | history of the Republic of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The process by which this consensus was reached among powerful, ambitious figures remains unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>.

## İnönü's Presidency and World War II Policies

İnönü's economic policies were initially cautious and "arrested" due to his understanding of the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, after 1946, with the opening of credit taps from the United States, he greenlit a rapid economic expansion policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He did not show interest in flashy symbolic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Instead, he championed more practical revolutions, such as the planting of tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Other significant contributions include the eradication of Menemen and malaria in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He also tried to remove "Kuvayi nationalist gang members" surrounding his predecessor's rule and promoted young, educated cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, notably supporting figures like Hasan Ali Yücel and İsmail Tonguç for the Village Institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Although these institutes were later closed, the idea originated during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

A major achievement of İnönü's leadership was keeping Turkey out of the disaster of the two World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This decision, influenced by the miserable state of the Turkish army in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, spared Turkey from the horrifying fates of countries like Greece, Yugoslavia, or Poland, which suffered immense losses and civil wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Entering the war, especially on the side of Germany, would have had unimaginable consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While the public suffered during these years due to policies like bread rationing and forced labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, this suffering was minimal compared to that endured by populations in war-torn nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The perception of İnönü's wartime policies is contrasted with the First World War: despite terrible losses, the First World War is remembered with "good intentions," while the Second World War, overcome with ration cards, led to hatred towards the administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This difference is attributed to the "plunder and tremendous wealth transfer" that occurred during the First World War under the Union and Progress regime, enriching certain segments of society at the expense of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. İnönü's caution prevented such widespread confiscation and plunder during WWII, notably demonstrated by the limited implementation of the 1942 Wealth Tax and conscription laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

During WWII, Turkey followed a "two-faced policy" to please both the British and Americans while avoiding German aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The Allies, while not wanting Turkey to enter the war on their side as it would be a "loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, sought to prevent Germany from gaining strategic resources like Turkish chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. When Germany neared defeat, the pro-German team of Saraçoğlu and Peker was purged, and a more Allied-friendly government was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

## Post-1950 Political Career and Legacy

After 1950, İnönü made history by being the first and possibly only national chief to leave power after an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The 1960s saw him playing a crucial role in curbing the radical direction of the 1960 military coup, leading to a softer, "half-baked" transition to democracy instead of a Nasserist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. He sided with the faction within the military that sought to clean up the existing system and then return to a party order, rather than the radical revolutionary officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

However, his later political career, including his conflicts with Demirel, support for the military memorandum in 1971, and his struggle to retain power from the younger Ecevit at 87 years old, are seen as damaging to his reputation and contributing to the "fossilization" and deadlock in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## İnönü and Turkish Society / Minorities

The notion of İnönü being of Armenian origin is explicitly refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. His family originated from Hakkari, then moved to Bitlis, Malatya, and İzmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

Regarding minorities, the 1934 anti-Jewish riots in Thrace, which involved the expulsion of Jewish populations from the west of Istanbul, are acknowledged as a high-level decision, characterized by mob violence, confiscation of goods, and a lack of state protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. This policy aimed to concentrate the non-Muslim population in Istanbul and also saw the "purification" of remaining Armenian communities in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

The expulsion of Greeks from Istanbul in 1963-64, affecting around 50,000 Greek passport holders, is described as a traumatic event where families were divided and property was confiscated, not limited to a suitcase full of belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This event, which the speaker witnessed as a child, was a "retaliation to Cyprus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This contrasts with the 1955 Istanbul Pogrom (September 6-7 events), which involved terrorizing and kidnapping rather than mass killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. The continued presence of Istanbul Greeks and Turks in Western Thrace was a mutual balance established by the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

## The Atatürk Cult and its Revival

During İnönü's leadership (post-1938), Atatürk's image was removed from money and public places, seen as a step towards erasing the traces of a 15-year "power intoxication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. The "cult of the founder God" was gradually suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. Atatürk's body was even kept in the basement of the Ethnography Museum for 12 years, reflecting an attempt to distance Turkey from Soviet-style leader cults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

However, after 1950, particularly with the rise of the Democrat Party, the Atatürk cult was "resurrected" and "came back from the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. This revival, including an Atatürk protection law, the Anıtkabir project, and the proliferation of Atatürk busts, was a "systematic, conscious policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. It is argued that this was a political decision made during a risky transition period from a single-party regime to a competitive democracy, where the Atatürk cult served as a "mortar" to ensure national unity and prevent fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

After the 1960 coup, this "mortar" was forcefully imposed, leading to the Atatürk personality becoming a "national religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. This process contributed to the ongoing deadlock in [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkish politics]].

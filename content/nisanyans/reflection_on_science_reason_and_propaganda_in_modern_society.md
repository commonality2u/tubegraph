The speaker reflects on the evolving perception of science, reason, and propaganda in contemporary society, contrasting older enlightenment-era views with modern realities where [[science_and_political_power | science and political power]] are deeply intertwined.

## The Traditional View of Reason and Science
The speaker references a view, articulated by Doğu Ergil, stating that belief removes the boundaries of logic, time, and space, making everything possible, but that finding the truth requires the guidance of reason and science [00:16:10]. This perspective, which asserts the undisputed superiority of a scientific and rational outlook, dates back to the early 1700s and was common among enlightened, educated, and intelligent individuals until the late 1900s [00:16:35]. Humanity was seen to have made incredible progress by freeing itself from superstitions and dogmas through this scientific approach [00:17:08]. The speaker notes that his own generation was raised with this belief [00:17:32].

However, the speaker argues that today's society is in a different place [00:17:43]. When people advocate for the "leadership of science," they are essentially asking others to trust certain individuals and a specific style of argumentation and evidence, rather than others [00:18:14]. For 200 years, there was an assumption of the high morality and inherent truthfulness of scientists, believing that their honesty was beyond question, unlike religious figures [00:18:42].

## The Turning Point: Science and State Power
The speaker identifies a significant turning point in the history of science at the end of World War II, specifically with the United States' establishment of the Institute of Advanced Research [00:19:32]. This institution gathered the world's best scientists, provided unlimited funds, and directed their research towards state benefit, including armaments, the atomic bomb, ballistic missiles, and psychology [00:19:50]. This marked a shift where science was explicitly geared towards state purposes [00:20:20].

While some scientists trained in the older, independent tradition either maintained their principles or experienced deep moral conflict (like Oppenheimer) or fiercely criticized this development (like Einstein), the long-term consequences were severe [00:20:32].

### Science as a Tool of Propaganda
Since the end of the 20th century, science has increasingly become a component of state propaganda and a servant of state power games [00:21:18]. The boundaries between science and propaganda have gradually blurred [00:21:37].

> "People who conduct research and reach conclusions outside of common goals and common state objectives have been violently suppressed, silenced and thrown out of the scientific community." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>

Scientific research has become an extraordinarily expensive enterprise, no longer reliant on simple tools and individual genius like Newton or Galileo, but requiring billions of dollars in investment [00:22:05]. This shift means that institutions investing this capital gain rights over the research results [00:22:35]. The speaker concludes that, in this context, telling people to "trust in science" is no different from telling them to "trust in priests or teachers" in a previous age [00:23:07].

## Public Perception and the Search for Truth
In this environment, people are "groping in the dark" to find the truth, sensing that much of what is imposed by the media and institutions is not real, right, or moral [00:23:12]. This uncertainty leads some to conspiracy theories, despair, fortune-telling, or esoteric beliefs and new religions [00:23:39].

## The Enduring Value of Reason
Despite the challenges, reason remains a crucial guide [00:24:01]. The speaker emphasizes that the essence of reason is criticism – the ability to question information, identify contradictions, and compare it with known facts [00:24:04]. Reason is a "habit of questioning dogmas" that does not go out of fashion [00:24:29]. However, while reason guides the mind, science is supposed to feed it [00:24:43].

## Modern Challenges to Science as a Guide
The speaker states that science is no longer a reliable guide, citing examples like the imposition of "various health fashions" and the "global warming incident" [00:25:01]. He believes those responsible for this loss of scientific reliability should be held accountable by history [00:25:16].

### The [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion | Relationship between Reason and Religion]] in Modern Society
The discussion of science and reason is paralleled with a critique of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, particularly regarding its pronouncements on sensitive moral issues like sexual intercourse with adopted children [00:25:42]. The speaker notes that the institution provides answers based on 1400 years of Islamic law, rather than modern personal or moral values [00:27:33]. He points out that issues like sexual relations, livelihood, and health constitute the "basic issues" that occupy ninety percent of people's lives [00:28:50].

He questions what alternative guidance the "enlightened and educated segment" of society offers on these fundamental human concerns, especially regarding love, passion, and divorce [00:30:01]. Historically, religious figures provided guidance on these matters [01:31:13]. The speaker argues that if the educated class cannot provide moral leadership, substantive novels, or epics that guide people, then they should be silent when criticizing religious institutions for providing answers, even if those answers are outdated [00:32:43]. This points to a broader [[social_and_political_comments_on_historical_and_modern_issues | social and political comment on historical and modern issues]] about the perceived class hatred within Turkish educated classes, which he claims is based on not seeing a large part of society as human beings and viewing them as inherently "dirty" [00:33:41].

## Distinguishing Propaganda from Real Information
The speaker reiterates that to distinguish propaganda from real information, one must use reason, logic, and rationality as essential weapons [01:14:00]. This involves questioning information for contradictions, checking its consistency with known facts, and recognizing that "nothing said in the dominant media is honest" [01:14:13]. He emphasizes the importance of extensive reading, discussion, and understanding the "players'" mindsets, strategies, goals, and concerns [01:14:32].# [[Reflection on science reason and propaganda in modern society]]

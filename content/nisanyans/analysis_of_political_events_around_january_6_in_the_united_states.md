Recent political discourse has prominently featured events in the United States, particularly those surrounding January 6, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## The January 6 Capitol Riot

The speaker identifies the most significant political news as not being in Türkiye, but rather in the [[political_situation_and_predictions_in_the_usa | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The event in question refers to January 6, two years prior, when a crowd stormed the American Congress building after Donald Trump was said to have lost the election and had to leave office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This incident led to a few hours of chaos, though not a coup, within the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

For two years, the American administration has reportedly made efforts to portray this event as the "largest organized rebellion against the state in American history," labeling it a "terrible crime" and a "constitutional crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Contradictory Evidence from Security Footage

Despite the official narrative, security camera footage from the Capitol building, reportedly tens of thousands of hours, was conveyed to journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. A program on American television evaluated this footage, revealing several incidents that challenge the official claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Police Casualties
Initially, the American administration claimed five police officers were killed during the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This number was later reduced to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. However, it was claimed that this individual did not die from being hit in the head with an object, as the Ministry of Justice had asserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The speaker finds it "unbelievable" that multiple police officers from a highly professional branch of the American security system would commit suicide "one after the other" following a serious incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Furthermore, security footage showed the police officer allegedly hit with a fire extinguisher walking calmly through corridors before and after the reported time of injury, showing no involvement in any fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Key Figures
A notable figure from the incident, characterized by "horns on his head and furs" (referring to the QAnon Shaman), was seen in the footage accompanied by multiple police officers from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This individual calmly walked around the parliament building, joked and chatted with police, who made no effort to stop or catch him; on the contrary, they "showed him the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. He later thanked "our police brothers for this nice behavior" at the Senate podium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### FBI Involvement
Another detail revealed was that a man who "encouraged people in the crowd to walk to the congress building with great provocation and enthusiasm" the day before the event had previously worked for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This individual was reportedly never investigated, and attempts to investigate him were "silenced amidst loud shouting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The American press, despite his alleged FBI connection, published articles expressing concern for his "deep psychological depression" due to the accusations against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Based on these observations, the speaker concludes that it is "clearly beyond doubt" that on January 6, the American police and the American FBI, controlled by powerful entities, "consciously and systematically raided the congress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This action, it is suggested, "created an environment where Trump would be discredited, credible and, if necessary, prosecuted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Reactions to the Revelations

Following the broadcast of this information, representatives from both political parties in Congress delivered "poisonous speeches," claiming that showing these images on television constituted "a great threat to American democracy and a terrible crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. They demanded that the channel and program owner "must be punished" and "fired from this job immediately," threatening that "what would be necessary would be done" otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This demonstrates "strong pressure to severely punish the television presenter who managed to show a document outside the official discourse of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Western Democracy

The speaker questions the perception of the [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | United States]] as a democratic country, stating, "Today, there is no democracy in any sense of the word in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. They argue that the world has changed from a simpler time when Western democracy was assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The speaker also highlights the situation in Greece, where "unprecedented police terror" is being experienced, with an "incredible number and power" of police forces attacking social unrest violently and harshly, "disregarding all existing laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This increasing violence and state of panic at the bureaucratic level suggests an impending explosion, with authorities attempting to "close all the holes before that explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The speaker asserts that "we are faced with the fascist dictatorship itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Türkiye, the speaker notes, is observing these events with a delay and is often "not aware of the course of events in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The world order established after 1945, based on the sovereignty of a country and its allies, is no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The world is heading towards a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## China's Rise and Geopolitical Tensions

China is experiencing a rapid upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Some decision-makers in America believe that the sooner they act, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The United States has been a tool used to restrict and suppress society's power and freedom of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## The Status of Taiwan

Taiwan, historically, was not a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. In 1949, after being defeated by the communists, the Chinese national government took refuge on the island of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. This government claimed to be the legitimate government of all China, a claim which the United States initially accepted due to close past relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. From 1930 onwards, the government in Taiwan was recognized as the representative of all China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This meant Taiwan held China's seat in the United Nations Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. This situation was considered absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the indigenous people of Taiwan developed an independence movement, asserting they were a separate country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. This movement was suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

### Strategic Importance of Taiwan
Taiwan is a significant global power, particularly in electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. America has prevented China from annexing Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.

## United States' Military Strategy and China

Since 1949, America has established a massive military encirclement chain around China, including countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This chain, which includes nuclear weapons, represents an attack chain against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

Taiwan appears to be the weakest link in this chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. China asserts that Taiwan is already part of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. Agreements made around 1974 indicated a decision to resolve the Taiwan issue, with the US agreeing not to try and seize Taiwan, nor to recognize it as a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. Currently, the US is perceived as provoking issues with Taiwan to force a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. This is expected to lead to significant trouble and disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

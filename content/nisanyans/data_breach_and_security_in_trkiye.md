### State's Role in Data Collection
The speaker questions the state's collection of such extensive personal information and why it becomes state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The speaker highlights the potential for this data to be a magnificent source of information for social scientists, encouraging its use to understand [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Trkiye]] better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Academic Interest
However, the speaker notes a perceived decline in the academic world's interest in genuine information or truth, suggesting that bureaucratic conflicts now dominate their focus, rendering information not directly useful for these conflicts as valueless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Recent events have unfolded rapidly in the [[political_landscape_and_candidates_in_american_elections | American political landscape]], highlighted by Joe Biden's decision to withdraw his candidacy for President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This move, which was anticipated, has significant implications for the upcoming [[american_elections_and_trump | American elections]] and the Democratic Party's strategy.

## The Expected Successor: Kamala Harris

With Biden's withdrawal, the expectation is that Kamala Harris will become the Democratic Party's candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The prevailing view is that there is no other viable candidate for the party to nominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While it's possible to nominate someone entirely unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, such swift decision-making and initiative are not frequently observed within the existing political framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Reasons for Biden's Withdrawal and Democratic Strategy

Biden's withdrawal was not entirely unexpected, as the "big guns" of the Democratic Party, particularly those with significant financial influence, appeared to realize his shortcomings after his debate with [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. Symptoms of what appeared to be Alzheimer's were already apparent when he was elected in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

The strategic calculation, it seems, revolves around Kamala Harris. Despite the perception that it will be "very hard" for her to win the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, she may be the desired President for certain factions due to her lack of strong political basis, power, or personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

## Contrast with JD Vance: A "New Event" in American Politics

The nomination of JD Vance as Trump's Vice President is considered a "new event" in [[political_landscape_and_candidates_in_american_elections | American politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Vance is seen as the first person since the early 20th century to come from the American working or poor class and become a candidate for such a high office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This contrasts sharply with presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the last 30-40 years, who typically originate from the wealthiest, deep-rooted fortunes or the upper bureaucracy/technocracy class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Vance is perceived as a "very very successful choice" for Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Unlike figures like Kamala Harris or Biden, who face strong rejection from a significant portion of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, Vance is not widely hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He is seen as a figure that 60% to 70% of society would find acceptable, if not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This broad appeal is expected to keep him at the forefront of world politics for the next 8 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. His biography, depicted in the movie *Hillbilly Elegy*, is considered an important "American Dream story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Alleged "Open Conspiracy" in the Trump Assassination Attempt

The speaker suggests that the recent assassination attempt on [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] appears to be an "open conspiracy" organized by intelligence agencies or the upper echelons of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>, indicating a perceived decline in the caliber of the American "deep state" since 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. Several observations support this perspective:

*   **Amateur Assassin:** The 20-year-old shooter was clearly an amateur, not a professional assassin, who missed his target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. It is suggested that such individuals are precisely who professional conspirators would use, as they are easily manipulated and unlikely to reveal orchestrators if caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Foreknowledge:** Biden and other high-level officials made statements days or weeks before the incident, assuring the public that the "political balance will change" and "Trump has no chance," as if they knew an assassination was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   **Media Presence:** Mainstream media outlets, which had avoided Trump's rallies all year, were all present with their most reliable reporters at the small Pennsylvania rally on the day of the assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. A New York Times reporter even brought a camera and captured a nano-second photo of the bullet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   **White House Meeting:** Biden, who was supposed to be on a four-day vacation, was in the White House's crisis room holding a top-level meeting exactly at the time of the rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   **Nikki Haley's Invitation:** The day before the assassination, Nikki Haley, a system-representative Republican preferred by some within the establishment, was hurriedly invited to the Republican Party Convention and given a critical speaking slot, implying a contingency plan for Trump's removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Security Lapses:** Trump's secret service team was allegedly replaced by amateurs the day before the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>, and the most obvious assassination point at the rally was left unsecured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

The speaker concludes that these obvious clues point not to a sophisticated deep state plot, but rather to "a lot of stupidity" and a decline in intelligence within growing bureaucracies, which inevitably leads to incompetence in even simple operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. This perceived bureaucratic incompetence is also highlighted by the handling of the Covid issue, where Biden, allegedly sick with Covid, did not wear a mask or distance himself, contradicting previous public health guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

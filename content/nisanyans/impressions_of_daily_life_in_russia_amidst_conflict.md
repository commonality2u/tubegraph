Despite ongoing conflicts, daily life in Russia, particularly in Moscow, appears to continue with a sense of normalcy, albeit with some specific disruptions related to security measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.

## Perceived Normality
There is not the slightest sign that the country is [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | at war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. Normal life continues its routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. Concerts, cinemas, and theaters are full, and people are busy with their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>. Observers have not seen any signs of fear or tension among the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>.

## Security Presence
In Moscow, visible security forces like police or soldiers are rarely seen on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a>. Over a day and a half, only one or two police officers were observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>. There is no noticeable disturbance such as ID checks for people, even at the entrance to shopping malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:31">[02:28:31]</a>.

## Internet Disruptions
Approximately two to three months prior, a drone attack on the [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Kremlin]] led to specific security measures affecting [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet access]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. To confuse drones, the [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet]] is cut off for about a minute every 10 minutes within a one-kilometer radius of the [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. This measure is intended to disrupt drone operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

Experiencing these [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet disadvantages]] led to a change in accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. While a luxurious hotel was initially used, it was later switched to a more budget-friendly place with reliable [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Outside the one-kilometer radius of the [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Kremlin]], such as a cafe two blocks away, [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet problems]] are not encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

Security measures near [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Putin's office]] also included restrictions, such as forbidding access to balconies due to concerns about rifle attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:31">[03:39:31]</a>. However, those knowledgeable about local conditions knew ways to bypass some of these measures, such as using a VPN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:31">[03:46:31]</a>.

A group tour to Georgia and Armenia is being organized in October, upon public request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Tour Dates and Weather
The most suitable dates for the trip, considering flights and other factors, are a departure on October 11th and a return on October 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. While the week of October 29th might be more suitable for some, a very dark winter begins in these countries by the end of October, making the earlier date more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

*   **3 days in Yerevan, Armenia:** The group will spend three days in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Application and Visa Information
*   **Application:** Program information and the application form have been shared online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The link will be shared in the comments at the end of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Armenian Visa:**
    *   For those with a Turkish passport, a visa is issued very quickly, online, and electronically within a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. It is generally a problem-free procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   **Important Note for Green Passports:** Armenia does not normally issue visas for green passports (Republic of Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. As of the broadcast, there has been no witnessed case of a visa being granted with a green passport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Safety
Concerns about safety in Armenia are unwarranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Armenia is described as an "extremely safe, extremely comfortable, extremely civilized country," where visitors will be welcomed with smiles and hospitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The same applies to Georgia, which, despite a "Wild West" period in the 1990s, has now met civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

[[Armenian history and relations]] and [[Ottoman expansion and Georgian principalities]] are key elements of the tour's cultural and historical focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The organizer believes this trip will be a very nice journey, similar to the well-received Morocco trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47">[02:01:47]</a>.

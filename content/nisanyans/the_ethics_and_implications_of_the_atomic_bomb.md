The release of the "Penhaimer" movie prompts a discussion on the atomic bomb, raising questions about its general nature, the [[Philosophical and ethical considerations | political responsibility of scientists]], whether it is the most important discovery in political history, and if the two bombs dropped on Japan constitute America's greatest sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It also leads to consideration of the inventor's responsibility for its consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## [[War and moral dilemmas | War and Morality]]

War is fundamentally an immoral thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It is a period where society's conscience and moral measures, such as what constitutes "befitting human behavior" or "right and wrong," are eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. During wartime, people can "turn into animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. There are basic moral impasses in war: if you don't kill, the other side will kill you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>; if you don't massively destroy the other side to shorten the war, more people will die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. War is intertwined with these dilemmas, and an escalation of savagery, driven by irrational hatred, can be experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The decision to drop two atomic bombs on Japan in [[nns stance during World War II | World War II]] was "terrible," but it is not appropriate to judge it by the moral standards of normal peacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. During the war years, both sides massively tried to destroy each other, often without distinction between civilians and soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The difference between killing a thousand people and a hundred thousand people is considered "a difference of degree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Justifications for Dropping the Bomb

### Stated Reasons

The American argument for dropping the atomic bomb was that Japan had "no intention of surrendering" despite being defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. To end the war, they claimed the only alternative was a land invasion of the Japanese main islands, which would result in massive casualties for both Japanese and American soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Dropping the bomb was presented as the quickest method to end the war, as Japan surrendered three days after its detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. From this perspective, the dropping of the atomic bomb could be seen as a "peace initiative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Hidden Motivations

Beyond the stated reasons, there were two additional motivations for dropping the bombs:

1.  **Intimidating the Soviet Union**: The United States and the Soviet Union were allies in [[nns stance during World War II | World War II]], but a post-war confrontation was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. After Germany's defeat, Soviet armies were redirected to the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. American strategists were concerned that the Soviets would demand a share of Japan's post-war settlement, as they had done in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The Soviets had already occupied some Japanese islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The dropping of the bombs aimed to force Japan's quick surrender *to the Americans*, preventing Soviet involvement and territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This dynamic later contributed to the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
2.  **Justifying Investment and Asserting Global Dominance**:
    *   The United States made an "incredible investment" to develop the nuclear bomb, a concept theorized in 1938-39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. They established a research city, mobilized leading physicists and chemists, and recruited German scientists for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   The initial plan was to use the bombs against Germany, but Germany was defeated before the bomb was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   A significant motivation for using the bomb was to justify this massive effort and "show" the fruit of their labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   The Americans calculated that their "incredible investment" would ensure they would be the sole nuclear power for a long time, allowing them to "rule the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This "vision of dominating the world" is described as an important part of the American spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   To establish this dominance, they believed they had to demonstrate the weapon's capacity, as "you can't explain the capacity of this weapon in words, it has to be seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This logic, it is argued, led to the destruction of Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Oppenheimer's Role and Regret

Oppenheimer is described as an "extraordinarily intelligent person" but also "defective" and possessing "characteristics of a sociopath," struggling to adapt to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Like many German-origin intellectuals of the 1930s, he had leanings towards socialism and Marxism, including ties to the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Despite this, he initially took a strong stance in favor of dropping the bomb in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. However, after the war, he "deeply regretted it" and mistakenly believed he could challenge the American state, leading to him being "crushed like a bug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

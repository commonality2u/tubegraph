The region of Iskenderun, particularly the area around Musa Dagh (Mount Musa) and Dörtyol, holds significant historical and cultural relevance for Armenians in Turkey.

## The Musa Dagh Resistance (1915)
The novel "40 Days on Musa Dagh," written by Franz Werfel around 1920, is a highly recommended and successful work of 20th-century German literature that recounts a significant event in Armenian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a>.

Musa Dagh is a mountain located in the Samandağ district, south of Hatay and Antakya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>. In 1915, seven Armenian villages were situated on its slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:26">[01:59:26]</a>. When the deportation order was issued in 1915, these villagers chose to resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:30]</a>, ascending the mountain and engaging in fierce combat against units of the Turkish army for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:41">[01:59:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>. Many perished during this resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:47">[01:59:47]</a>. By chance, they managed to communicate with a passing French warship, leading to the rescue of the survivors, who then lived in a refugee camp in Alexandria, Egypt, for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>. Some of them later returned to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>.

In the early 1980s, Vakıflı Village was the only remaining Armenian village in Musa Dagh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>. The speaker, who visited the village, encountered elderly residents who still remembered these events and recounted the well-known story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:49">[02:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>.

## Armenian Presence in Dörtyol and Payas
Beyond Musa Dagh, a significant Armenian population also resided in other parts of the Iskenderun district, notably in Dörtyol and Payas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:39">[02:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>. Many of these Armenians were 19th-century immigrants who moved from eastern provinces to Adana, [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]], and the coast during a period of modernization and capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:50">[02:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:55">[02:01:55]</a>.

## 1909 Adana-Iskenderun Pogrom
At the end of the 19th century, social tensions erupted, leading to a large pogrom and massacre against Armenians in the Adana and Iskenderun districts in 1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. Armenians in Dörtyol were greatly affected by this massacre, leading to destruction and scattering of the population, with survivors migrating elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:35">[02:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. Before 1909, Armenians constituted the majority of Dörtyol's population, approximately two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>. These events occurred six years prior to the 1915 deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:10">[02:03:10]</a>. It is understood that the Musa Dagh area was not seriously affected by the 1909 events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a>, as the Armenians there resisted in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:33">[02:03:33]</a>.

## Linguistic and Cultural Aspects
The Armenians in the Samandağ district have a distinct history and speak a unique dialect of Armenian that is difficult for other Armenian speakers to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:19">[02:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>. Their presence in the region dates back a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.

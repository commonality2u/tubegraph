This article explores the historical and evolving ethnic composition of Eastern Anatolia, drawing insights from a travel book titled "Turkey East of Ankara" published in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The book, written after six years of extensive research and travel in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, aims to discuss sensitive subjects without causing undue alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It is a bilingual book, with the Turkish and English versions offering different approaches to cater to distinct audiences and their varying preconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Research Methodology

The author frequently traveled to Eastern Anatolia over a six-year period, visiting numerous places, including villages in Ardahan, districts and villages of Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and northern Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. During these travels, interviews were conducted with a wide range of people, from villagers to cultured residents of the region, as well as gendarmerie and police commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This extensive fieldwork aimed to understand and learn about the region's [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | ethnic structure and cultural structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Historical Ethnic Composition (Pre-20th Century)

A clear observation from the research is that, until the early 20th century, major cities in Eastern Anatolia were predominantly inhabited by Turkish populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Urban Centers
*   **Van:** In the 1910s, there was no trace of Kurds in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır:** In the city center, Turkish was spoken alongside Kurdish, and most prominent families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The origins of families in Diyarbakır's center are diverse, with some having Circassian ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Mardin:** The city's language was Arabic, and its ruling families considered themselves Turkish, though nearly all had Armenian ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Mardin's population also included a significant Armenian presence (20-30%) and an Assyrian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Definition of "Turk" in the Ottoman Context
Within the Ottoman Empire, the ruling class, regardless of their original [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | ethnic background]] (e.g., Albanian, Circassian, Georgian), would become "Turks" upon migrating to cities, gaining education, and entering state mechanisms, adopting Turkish as their language and becoming part of Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Ottoman ruling class was highly cosmopolitan, a blend of various origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A person from any part of the empire who became part of the social education system was recognized as a Turk and spoke Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Even families of Kurdish origin, like the sons of Şeref Han, became part of the empire's ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Role of Non-Muslims
Non-Muslims undertook nearly all urban services in these societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. At the beginning of the 20th century, about half of Van's population was Turkish, and more than half of Diyarbakır was governed by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Impact of Demographic Shifts

The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had unforeseen negative consequences for the Turks, as it removed the group that provided a cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure to the cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became difficult to live in, lacking essential services like dentists or tailors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

During the Republican period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities dwindled, with their children migrating to Ankara and Istanbul for education and not returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This led to a gradual decay of these cities until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | Rural-to-Urban Migration]] and Kurdishization
From the 1960s, an economic boom led to a significant rural-to-urban [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This resulted in the gradual Turkification of cities in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. However, there was a later shift in the ethnic makeup.

## Contemporary Ethnic Landscape

By the 1970s and 1980s, when Mardin was first visited by the author, there was no trace of Kurds in the city center, only Arabs and Arabic-speaking populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Meanwhile, Kızıltepe, a nearby city 20 kilometers away, became a predominantly Kurdish city, growing significantly due to the prevention of Kurdish [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration]] into Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, this "wall" eventually collapsed, and Kurds are now the numerical majority in the center of Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Today, Diyarbakır is 80-90% Kurdish, if not close to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Van also has a significant Kurdish majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The "greatest success" of the Republican regime in Eastern Türkiye has inadvertently been the complete Kurdishization of this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While Kurds were a numerous element before, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Today, they are almost homogeneously dominant in their own areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Implications for Language and Social Demands
The significant Kurdish majority has created social demands that are deemed impossible to prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. While Turkish is an official language, the overwhelming majority of the population speaks Kurdish with pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. It is now a fact that everyone living in the region, including Turks, who wishes to live there must learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Delaying the acceptance of this fact will only lead to greater trouble and potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. A homogeneous population of 20 million, with 87-90% speaking their own language and developing their own intellectuals who express national identity, cannot be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Geopolitical Considerations

The establishment of an independent Kurdish state in the region faces significant challenges, including an unfavorable international conjuncture and a vast difference in military power compared to the Republic of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

External powers have varying interests in the stability of Türkiye and the region:
*   The United States is unlikely to abandon a vital partner and ally like Türkiye or seek its disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   Russia, however, could benefit from Türkiye's weakening control, especially in its eastern regions closer to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Türkiye is viewed as a state established with the aim of posing a threat to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Therefore, the division or rupture of Türkiye, particularly its eastern parts, would suit Russia's long-term strategic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   Other states that could benefit from the creation of a Kurdistan or multiple Kurdistans in the region include Syria, Iraq, and potentially Saudi Arabia and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

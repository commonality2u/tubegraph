## Current State of France and Europe

Recent observations suggest a deepening crisis in France, characterized by ongoing civil unrest and significant societal shifts. What began as a potential civil war or a massive uprising in France followed a prior period of conflict in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The latest unrest, which is considered worse than "dirty hands," involves an uprising by Arab and African populations, who constitute 12% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

The speaker believes that such an uprising has no chance of success against the overwhelming power of the police and the state's military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. For an uprising to succeed, it would require leadership, organization, and clear political goals, such as taking over the country's administration or carrying out a massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Without the power to realize these goals, such movements eventually fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The police's ability to take prisoners, with nearly a thousand detained so far, highlights the unequal nature of the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

This is not an isolated incident in France; there have been successive uprisings, including the "yellow vests" movement two to three years prior, and serious protests against government policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. These different uprisings involve distinct groups, indicating multiple simultaneous conflicts within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Broader European Context
France's situation reflects a broader trend expected across all European and North American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. The conflict is not merely between immigrants and natives but also a "war between whites and the urban managerial elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Modern Western states appear to be losing control, characterized by a loss of administrative power, social consensus, and increasing disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Administrative cadres in the United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union countries are reportedly in a state of panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. However, they lack the intellectual, personal, and organizational capacity to implement long-term solutions, relying instead on police forces to suppress immediate unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

This crisis is compounded by the strong possibility of future economic and military defeats, which, when combined with the existing legitimacy and administrative crises, could lead to significant collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The future for elite and administrative cadres in Europe looks bleak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

### [[cultural_assimilation_issues_in_europe | Cultural Assimilation Issues in Europe]]
The [[cultural_assimilation_issues_in_europe | refugee crisis in Europe]] is considered very serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Historically, societies have faced such challenges, recalling the situation of the Roman Empire after four centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. A key issue is that more than 10% of society consists of radically foreign populations who do not wish to adapt to local culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Their loyalty to their own culture and social assumptions is often stronger than the loyalty of native Europeans to their own culture and social structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

#### [[travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_europe | Personal Observations from France]]
From [[travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_europe | personal travel experiences in France]] last summer, including time in Paris and northwestern regions, a "serious invasion" was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Large parts of cities and towns, including specific neighborhoods, have reportedly "completely passed into the hands of Africans and Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. French natives are perceived as "comfortable" and not working, with restaurants often closed or offering limited service, contrasting with the hard-working nature of Turkish kebab shops or prisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This has led to French citizens withdrawing to a "besieged" state, while Africans and Arabs reportedly feel like "rulers of the country," often exhibiting hostility towards the country's armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

### Historical Parallels and Future Outlook
Similar events have occurred in French history, such as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, where Protestants were indiscriminately killed, leading to their forced migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. Such a development is considered almost inevitable in the current situation, not only in France but in other countries as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

The underlying contradiction is not primarily between immigrants and natives, but rather between an incredibly wealthy, globalist, and often hostile management cadre, and a large white middle class that feels increasingly marginalized and angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. This elite, including EU managers and the US Democratic Party's management cadres, might be expected to use immigrants as a "strike force" against the middle class (e.g., Macron and Algerians against the yellow vests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. However, this alliance has not materialized, making the conflict a three-sided one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

Europe's current trajectory is described as heading towards "great destruction, great chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. While Western Europe and EU member states are facing severe challenges, Eastern European countries like Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, and especially Hungary, are seen as being in a better position, having protected themselves from this "disease" and maintaining a calmer social environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

### [[cultural_and_societal_transformations_in_the_western_and_islamic_worlds | Cultural and Societal Transformations]]
In the West, the "death of God" was preceded by the "death of the church," meaning the decline of religious rules and traditions in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:25">[47:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46">[47:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25">[48:25]</a>. Turkey's attempt at Westernization from the mid-19th to the late 20th century aimed to break the dominance of religion but failed to offer a convincing alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42">[48:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08">[49:08]</a>. The West itself has "died" in the 21st century, losing its quality as an ideal model for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38">[49:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49">[49:49]</a>. This has led many Turks to retreat to Islam as the only known alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01">[50:01]</a>, while Kurds have turned to nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:13">[50:13]</a>. The bankruptcy of the Western model has resulted in three primary defense lines in Turkey: fanatic Turkish nationalism (fascism), Islamic piety, and Kurdish nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21">[50:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51">[50:51]</a>. Under these conditions, it is difficult for religion to lose its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01">[51:01]</a>.

## Early History and Geopolitical Context
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Armenia was a small province settled as a project of the Russian Empire, stemming from a piece of the old Iranian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>. Peoples from the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]] and Iran were settled in Anatolia, creating a region with diverse ethnicities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

In 1918, after the collapse of the "great Armenian project" envisioned with "great dreams," Armenia was granted a limited independence as a form of consolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This neutrality was established under the protection of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Challenges
Armenia's geopolitical struggles are marked by several factors:
*   **Neighboring Relations**: As a consequence of its reliance on Russia, Armenia experienced poor relations with all its neighbors, including Turks to its east and west, and Georgians to its north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Sea Access**: Armenia is a landlocked country with no access to the sea, which significantly hinders its economic prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Military Limitations**: Being under Russia's influence prevented Armenia from establishing its own significant military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Inability to Cooperate**: Hostility with its neighbors prevented rational cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Existential Risk**: Armenia remained a country where its existence was consistently at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Armenian Success within the Ottoman Empire
Despite later struggles, Armenians achieved significant successes during the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]] period, particularly in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

By the 19th century, the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]] faced dysfunction, struggling to adapt to the modern world despite its vast geography and cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The Empire, though one of the largest states globally by the late 19th century with significant economic potential and military resources, faced economic regression and intellectual stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. It consistently lost territory due to military defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

In this context, the Armenian nation played a crucial and unparalleled role, acting as an essential link for the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]]'s connection to the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Armenians excelled in various modern fields within [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman society]], including:
*   Photography workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>
*   Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>
*   Insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>
*   Newspapers and printing houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>
*   Coffee and caffeine trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
*   Commodity trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>
*   Agricultural innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>

Many Armenian entrepreneurs were well-educated and capable of conducting business globally, with some migrating to places like Brazil and achieving great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This success was intrinsically linked to the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]]'s inability to modernize on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

Around the late 19th and early 20th centuries, despite a small population of 3 to 3.5 million, Armenians produced a disproportionately high number of notable individuals and made significant contributions to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. It was astonishing how one in every ten Armenians achieved great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

When conflict erupted with the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]], Armenians, particularly those of Ottoman origin, migrated to Middle Eastern countries (Syria, Lebanon, Egypt) and Western countries (France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. For one or two generations, they retained the memory of this bright period through their family traditions, continuing to achieve remarkable feats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Armenian Experience in the Soviet Period
The Soviet period brought a different experience for Armenians. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, Armenia emerged as a pioneer in the Soviet Union in fields such as technology, politics, urbanism, music, and chess, producing individuals who achieved great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

However, the Soviet experience is viewed with ambivalence by some Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. While the Soviets built modern towns and cities to solve basic problems, creating earthquake-resistant uniform housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, this development largely ceased by the 1960s. Armenia became confined to a "miserable police state with narrow horizons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. It has not been able to advance beyond that point since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

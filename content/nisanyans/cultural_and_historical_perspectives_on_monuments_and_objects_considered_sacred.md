## The Nature of Sacredness
The perception of objects as ordinary or sacred is fundamentally a matter of [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | perspective]] rather than an inherent quality of the objects themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. Holiness is attributed to an object, meaning it is a concept belonging to human psychology and viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. For example, the Kaaba can be seen by some as merely a rectangular box covered in cloth, while others perceive it as the center of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. The choice of which perspective is "more beautiful" is also subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

## The Role of Sacredness in Creation
Historically, almost all beauties created by humanity have been inspired by or dedicated to something sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. This includes works created in the name of God, religion, or even monarchs and emperors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

In various forms of art, including:
*   Architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>
*   Painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>
*   Music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>
*   Literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>

Nearly all great artistic creations have stemmed from a feeling of serving something sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Viewing a painting merely as a set of colors on a board, while a valid perspective, is considered a "sterile point of view" that does not produce anything and only leads to a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_historical_and_cultural_monuments | importance of historical and cultural monuments]] and art in reflecting human values and perceptions of the sacred.

Initial claims suggesting a 1400-year-old Quran in a university being 99.5% similar to modern copies are considered fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. There is no reliable data indicating that the Quran was written down seriously before 50 or 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The information regarding its early transcription, location, or script is based on half-truths that only those who wish to believe will accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Evolution of the Arabic Script

The [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran | Arabic script]], as it is known today, was first codified around 680 AD during the time of the Caliph Abd al-Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This codification, effectively the "invention" of the Arabic script for the purpose of writing the Quran, occurred after a period where the script was very rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

During Muhammad's time and the subsequent 60 years, the [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran | Arabic script]] was primarily used for graffiti, worship scribbles, or short notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It lacked the dots (diacritics) and vowel movements that define modern Arabic, making it a distorted version useful only for notes, not literary works or official letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The idea that Arabic, a tribal language, could be written did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Dominant Scripts of the Period
At that time, the common written language in the Middle East for cultured individuals was [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts | Syriac script]], used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Quranic Compilation and Political Influence

The claim that a commission was established during Muhammad's time or Hz. Osman's era to write down the Quran is a fabrication from the Abbasid period, approximately 180 years after the events it describes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This narrative was created to alleviate discomfort among people who found it unsettling that the Quran was written long after Muhammad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Scientifically and objectively, the Quran was compiled around 680 AD during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Before this compilation, the Quranic text was primarily transmitted orally, with people memorizing and reciting it in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Regional Variations and Standardization
When the [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran | Quran]] reached the stage of being written, different traditions existed in various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These [[evolution_of_quranic_texts_across_different_regions | regional textual variations]] caused disputes, with people asserting different versions of verses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

To standardize the text, these dissenting voices were silenced by the order of Hajjaj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A single text was created that aligned with the [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription | political interests]] of the common Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Azize Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

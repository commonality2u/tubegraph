## Political Discussions in Turkey
Historical topics often discussed in Turkey include the foundation of the Republic, the Union and Progress, and the "adventures" of Mustafa Kemal [00:01:01]. These subjects are noted as being of significant interest to young people, leading to deep conversations [00:01:18].

A significant aspect of Turkey's [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | political landscape]] is the level of public discourse, which is considered "disgusting" and "underground" [01:43:13]. This decline is attributed to a continuous downward trend over decades, from figures like Süleyman Demirel and Turgut Özal to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Devlet Bahçeli [01:43:41]. The speaker expresses shame regarding the brainless, hateful, and primitive concepts used in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | political statements]] [01:44:26].

### The Term "Türkiye" and "Türkiyeli"
The term "Türkiye" likely began to be widely used around 1985-1987, during the time of Turgut Özal [01:11:47]. The term "Türkiyeli" emerged from idealism [01:12:04] and is seen as a result of the Republic's ideology and education system contaminating the term "Türkiye" [01:12:22]. This term was sought to acknowledge a significant population, over 20% of the country, who are citizens of the Republic of Turkey but do not identify as Turkish [01:12:38]. The aim was to create an expression that would make them feel that Turkey is also their homeland [01:12:59]. Turgut Özal is credited with first using the term "Türkiyeli" [01:13:08]. Bülent Ecevit's poem "Pülümürlü Ageless Woman," published in 1974 or 1975, also used the expression "Türkiyeli" [01:41:22].

### Social Dynamics and Public Respect
A lack of public respect and a sense of common interest is identified as a wider problem in Turkish society [01:06:41]. This is exemplified by the behavior of drivers and a historical example of a communal water system in Şirince, where a well-built system from the late 18th century was abandoned for individual, chaotic plastic pipe installations, leading to constant conflict [01:07:05]. This issue is thought to be a result of social organization forms influenced by Ottoman and Islamic structures [01:09:38].

### Süleyman Demirel's Political Pragmatism
Süleyman Demirel, despite being a well-read intellectual with a broad, though superficial, knowledge of contemporary American literature and a tremendous memory, adopted a "patriotic language" as a politician [01:03:53]. This was attributed to his political career being under the "dark shadow" of Adnan Menderes and the May 27 coup [01:04:15]. He concluded that in Turkey, politicians must align with the military's demands, adopting their culture, mindset, and language [01:05:24].

## Global Political Dynamics
### Power Cliques in the USA
Since 2001, following the Twin Towers attack, there has been a growing power in the United States [01:05:11]. This cadre systematically undermined the state apparatus and transformed democratic traditions into a "fraud and a buffoon" [01:05:32]. This group has managed to permanently seize power by sabotaging party competition and increasingly dominating the ideology and institutions of a national security state [01:06:08]. The election of Trump was seen as a "rupture" in this cadre's process of absolutizing its power [01:06:17]. It appears "extremely difficult or even impossible" to remove this cadre through normal political procedures [01:07:47]. Possible catalysts for change could be a radical financial crisis (leading to state debt and inability to pay salaries), a civil war, or a direct military intervention [01:07:59].

### Dictators and Freedom
The concept of a dictator's freedom is explored, asserting that it tends to decrease rather than increase [01:17:01]. Dictators face daily fear of assassination [01:46:30]. As a dictator establishes authority, dissenting voices are silenced, making objection dangerous [01:47:06]. This leads to a shrinking "area" of interaction where normal disagreements become impossible [01:47:32]. The dictator becomes isolated and unable to trust the loyalty of those who obey, as their obedience might be out of fear, not genuine loyalty [01:48:50]. To test loyalty, dictators feel compelled to "increase the dose of lies," expecting absurd affirmations (e.g., "The capital of England is Çemişkek") [01:49:41]. This constant test of loyalty leads to paranoia and the eventual need to eliminate even those who comply, based on subtle cues like a blink or lack of excitement [01:50:43]. This path ultimately leads to the dictator becoming a "puppet" of the mechanisms they created [01:17:16].

The example of the first president of the Turkish Republic is used to illustrate this paradox. After a tremendous struggle to re-establish a collapsed state, he became a "prisoner" in the Çankaya mansion [01:19:20]. This led to depression and disappointment, driving him to increasingly "crazy new projects" and "imaginary wars" out of boredom or a feeling of being bitten, such as the alphabet mobilization and the rewriting of history [01:19:38].

### Developments in Israel
Significant regime upheaval is occurring in Israel, particularly with Benjamin Netanyahu's return as Prime Minister [01:17:54]. The seemingly "shakeless" alliance between Israel and the United States is showing signs of wear and tear, experiencing an "earthquake" for the first time since the 1950s [01:18:18]. In the Ukraine War, Israel adopted a separate, equidistant position from the Western alliance, which was unprecedented [01:19:05]. Israel's aggressive approach in Syria and its reliance on American hegemony in the Middle East [01:19:54] are now challenged by recent developments, such as the alliance between Saudi Arabia and Iran [01:20:22]. The American military presence in Syria is becoming unsustainable, significantly changing Israel's options [01:20:39]. There is a hope that Israeli administrators will reconsider their increasingly fanatic and bigoted stance and return to flexibility and rationality [01:21:13].

### Decline of Catholic and Orthodox Churches
The Greek Orthodox Church and the Vatican are undergoing a rapprochement process, but the speaker believes "nothing will happen" from it [01:12:55]. Both institutions, especially the Catholic Church, are in serious decline, having lost influence and power over the past 200 years, particularly in the last 20-30 years [01:13:16]. Church attendance and income have radically fallen in Catholic countries [01:13:41]. In Latin America, people are leaving the Catholic Church in large numbers for Protestantism, which is dynamic and growing [01:13:52]. The rapprochement is seen as a natural reaction to this decline, a "come on brother, we are losing" mentality [01:14:24]. While Orthodoxy is still strong in Eastern European countries like Greece and Russia, it is also showing signs of weakening, with monasteries closing [01:14:59]. However, Orthodoxy as a social tradition has not faced the same process of erasure as Catholicism [01:15:17]. The dialogue between these institutions is seen as a positive development, but the idea of a Catholic Church being established in Turkey, especially in Fener, and being recognized by other Orthodox churches, is considered "absurd" [01:15:45].

## Turkish-Armenian Relations
### Trade Relations
Trade relations already exist between Turkey and Armenia, with many Turkish products found in Armenian supermarkets [00:02:56]. However, the speaker notes that the vast majority of Armenians are not in favor of opening the border with Turkey, with those against it being much more numerous [00:03:27]. It is a misunderstanding to think Armenians are desperate for the border to open [00:03:50].

### Armenian Religions and Identity
Historically, Armenians adopted various religions. Their ancient religion included Iranian traditions and a pantheon from the Urartian period [02:22:04]. In the 1st or 2nd century BC, they imported Greek gods, building temples in the Erzincan region [02:22:56]. By the 4th century, with the arrival of Christianity, these temples were destroyed and replaced by churches and monasteries [02:52:27]. The conversion to Christianity involved a violent internal struggle, where temples were destroyed, priests killed, and the vast properties of the temples seized by the church [02:27:07]. The church's administrator, Azizi, and his family quickly became the largest property owners in Armenian land [02:27:49].

Since the 4th century, being Christian has been synonymous with being Armenian [02:29:14]. Armenians later severed ties with the Greek Orthodox Church, adopting a unique sect [02:29:32]. Until the 19th century, membership in the Armenian church was the essence of being Armenian; leaving the religion meant leaving the nation and becoming Turkish [02:59:58]. This was due to the religious nature of education systems in the Ottoman Empire, where children attended mosque, church, or synagogue schools [03:03:37]. A child leaving the Armenian community would attend a Muslim teacher's school, learning Arabic script and Turkish, thus losing Armenian language and culture within a generation [03:19:49].

From the mid-18th century, the Armenian church faced a serious crisis [03:40:05]. Some Armenians, disturbed by the church's bigotry and exploitative practices, converted to Catholicism [03:43:34], and later to Protestantism as a more radical break [03:43:44]. Approximately 10% of Anatolian Armenians became Catholic, and 1-2% became Protestant [03:51:17]. These converts were no longer considered Armenians [03:52:58].

In the second half of the 19th century, intellectuals in Istanbul and Tbilisi sought a new basis for Armenian identity that could unite Gregorian, Catholic, and Protestant Armenians [03:56:00]. Meanwhile, in rural Eastern Anatolia, many Armenian villagers converted to Islam, particularly joining the Naqshbandi order [03:7:46]. This was partly driven by anger towards the church, which they felt was inadequate in protecting them from Kurdish attacks despite the taxes paid [03:10:01].

### Kurdish Role in the Armenian Genocide
The Armenian historical narrative is not limited to the 1915 incident, which is seen as the "final blow" of a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, and usurpation [01:34:27]. Prior to 1915, the "real tyrant" of Armenians was the Kurdish element, who specialized in killing Armenians, seizing property, burning churches, and beheading priests [01:35:09]. Armenians often sought refuge with the Ottoman state against Kurdish attacks [01:35:49].

In 1915, the Turkish state, specifically the Union and Progress administration, consciously carried out a "project of annihilation" to cleanse the "Armenian problem" [01:36:13]. They used Kurdish lords, their networks, and the Kurdish people as allies and subcontractors, leveraging an existing tradition of massacre and extortion [01:36:50]. The state effectively gave permission by indicating that "the state is behind you" and "we will not judge anyone for the crimes they have committed" [01:37:22].

Recent studies suggest a strong hostility towards the Armenian Church rather than the Armenian nation itself [01:37:50]. After the Armenian population was largely eliminated, the Kurdish masses realized they were now "face to face with the Turkish state" and would be destroyed [01:38:24]. The Kurdish attitude towards the Armenian issue has changed radically in the last 20-30 years, which is seen as a positive development [01:38:50]. The speaker suggests it would be good for Turks to overcome their prejudices and ignorance like the Kurds have [01:39:20].

## Conscientious Objection in Turkey
Osman Murat, the first person imprisoned for conscientious objection in Turkey, is recognized for his honorable struggle [01:23:53]. The speaker acknowledges the heroism of individuals who faced personal pain for their conscientious objection in the 1980s and 90s, condemning the oppression they suffered [01:24:13].

However, from a broader historical perspective, conscientious objection is a deep-rooted tradition in Christian countries, including Tsarist Russia, due to the separation of church and state [01:24:43]. This tradition allowed for a margin of flexibility for a minority of the society to reject military service [01:25:15]. In contrast, Turkey has no such tradition, where "being a Muslim means being a soldier" and the duty of Jihad is obligatory [01:25:27].

The emergence of conscientious objection in Turkey is seen as a crisis related to the modernization of the country [01:26:01]. It represents Turkey's attempt to abandon its old culture and adopt Western behavioral patterns, leading to "stumbles" [01:26:11]. This reflects the dilemma of wanting to be Westerners while simultaneously resisting giving up some conditions of being Turkish and Muslim [01:26:29].

Today, military service is gradually changing from general recruitment to professional armies, where the concept of conscience is less relevant [01:27:06]. The war in Ukraine is cited as an example, where the fighting is primarily conducted by professional, paid groups like Chechens [01:27:39].

The speaker believes that conscientious objection is an indispensable human right [01:28:48]. While he encourages young men, including his own sons, to experience army service as a valuable experience for self-knowledge and understanding society, this does not contradict the right to conscientious objection [01:29:02].

## "Urums" (Turkish-speaking Orthodox Greeks)
"Urums" are identified as an ethnic group primarily living in Georgia and, to some extent, Russia, with an extinct presence in Armenia [01:30:15]. They are members of the Greek Orthodox Church with classical Greek names, but their only mother tongue is Turkish, specifically with a heavy Erzurum accent (Eastern Turkish) [01:30:30].

The speaker suspects that in 1828-1829, during and after the Russian-Turkish war, some Turks with no Greek heritage may have migrated to Russia under the guise of being Greek Orthodox, seeing it as an opportunity for a better life [01:31:54]. This suspicion is supported by observations from a cemetery in an "Urun Village" in Armenia, where half the family names were Turkish, such as "Yellow Mahmutoğlu" [01:32:17]. While Turkish names were common among Greeks in the 19th century, a name like "Mahmut" for a Christian is considered impossible [01:33:38].

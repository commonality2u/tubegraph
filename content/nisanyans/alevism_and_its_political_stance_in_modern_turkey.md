[[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is a religious and cultural phenomenon in Turkey that has developed over centuries, distinct from mainstream Sunni Islam. It is characterized by its resistance to Islamic bigotry and a unique historical relationship with the state.

## Historical Development
[[historical_development_of_alevism | Alevism]], as it is known today, largely crystallized between the late 15th and early 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This period saw the rise of the Safavid dynasties in Ardabil, Iran, starting with Cüneyt, Haydar, and culminating with Shah Ismail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. They initiated a significant revolutionary and protest movement against classical Sunni Islam, which intriguingly coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

The movement threatened the existence of the Ottoman Empire during the reigns of Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Beyazıt II, and was later brutally suppressed by Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The roots of this movement go back to earlier periods, including the Father Ishak and Ilyas rebellions in Anatolia in the 1200s, and various other groups like Hurufism and Batinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Many "new Muslims" in Anatolia, often forced converts, also contributed to the unrest that fueled these rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

## Relationship with the Ottoman State
The Ottoman state perceived [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | Alevism]] as an existential ideological threat, akin to "the devil himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Consequently, the Ottomans ruthlessly suppressed the Alevi movement for centuries, exiling them to mountains, killing those declared illegal, and employing all tools of an authoritarian state to destroy [[historical_context_and_origins_of_alevism_in_anatolia_and_surrounding_regions | Alevism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Persecution continued, notably in the 19th century during the suppression of the Janissary Corps, which had Bektashi affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This historical oppression forced Alevi communities to live illegally, flee to remote areas, hide their identities, and worship secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

## Core Characteristics and Beliefs
The defining characteristic of [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is its fundamental resistance to Islamic bigotry, Sharia law, and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Alevis reject many basic Islamic practices such as fasting, pilgrimage, and zakat, and do not accept the first four caliphs except Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. They consider Ali and his lineage, including Hasan, Husayn, and the subsequent 12 imams, as the true representatives of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

Unlike Iranian Shiism, which has a strong academic and legal framework, Turkish Alevism lacks a central madrasah or mullah hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. Instead, it relies on local "dedes" who continue shamanistic and traditional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Ethnic Diversity
[[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | Alevism]] in Turkey is an eclectic movement, drawing from various traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.
*   **Turks**: Approximately half of Turkish Alevis identify as Turkish and are deeply attached to Turkmen and Central Asian origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>.
*   **Kurds**: An equally large segment of Alevis are Kurds, especially prevalent west of the Euphrates in regions like Tunceli, Malatya, Sivas, and Erzincan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Arabs (Nusayris)**: In Hatay and Antakya, there's an Arab Alevi population, also known as Nusayris, with distinct traditions and a closer resemblance to Arab Christians in lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.
*   **Bektashis**: Found in southern Albania and the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria, Bektashism is a form of Alevism, representing a "not fully Muslim" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
*   **Tahtacı**: Primarily forest villagers in the Aegean and Mediterranean coastal mountains, they have a distinct, more primitive culture and often do not align with leftist politics, sometimes voting for MHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.
*   **Abdals**: Concentrated in Central Anatolia, especially around Gaziantep, they are often musicians and entertainers, viewed similarly to Romani people but defining themselves as Alevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>.

Geographically, Alevism is concentrated in a clear triangle-shaped region in Anatolia, encompassing parts of Sivas (Divriği, Kangal), Tunceli-Erzincan, Tokat, Amasya, Malatya, and extending to Maraş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. This area historically aligns with regions of rebellion against the Byzantine Orthodox Church, suggesting a deep cultural fault line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.

## Political Stance in Modern Turkey
The historical persecution and ideological conflict with Sunni Islam has shaped the [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis' connection to Kemalism in Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. For centuries, the primary adversary was the dominant Sunni Islamic ideology of the Ottoman state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a>. With the advent of the Republic of Turkey and its secular principles under Ataturk, Alevis found a political platform that, for the first time, offered them a degree of acceptance and inclusion within the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. This enabled Alevis to hold positions in civil service, police, and the military, asserting their right to be part of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

Today, Alevis largely support the CHP (Republican People's Party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. They view secularism and Ataturk as symbols protecting them from the Sunni-defined state, especially in the context of [[contemporary_turkish_politics_and_islamic_influence_in_state_ideology | contemporary Turkish politics and Islamic influence in state ideology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. This allegiance to Kemalism is seen as their primary means to assert their rights and share in the state, given the perceived ineffectiveness of other alternatives like socialism or the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>.

However, Kemalism is also considered a "dead end" due to its minority status in Turkish politics, unable to achieve widespread popular support through democratic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. In the 1960s, some Alevis attempted to engage with moderate right-wing politics, but they were ultimately disillusioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. By the 1970s, many Alevis, particularly revolutionary youth, shifted towards the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>. The Alevi culture significantly influenced the Turkish leftist movement of that era, with its folk songs and traditions becoming symbols of the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. The fundamental platform of the Turkish left became anti-Muslimness, reflecting the Alevi struggle against dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

Alevi upbringing instills a critical perspective towards official state narratives and aggressive ideologies, fostering individuals who question authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:15:00">[43:15:00]</a>. Despite state efforts at assimilation, this core foundation of resistance and critical thinking continues to be a defining characteristic of many Alevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.

## Refuting the "Uncouth Peasant" Idea

A common assertion posits that a people, largely perceived as "uncouth and peasants," struggle to overcome ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]], the majority of the population are not peasants; the peasant population has fallen below 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Furthermore, the claim that Turkish people are uncouth is disputed, with many being quite well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

While there have been [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | serious problems]] in adapting to city culture for those newly urbanized from village backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the true fault does not lie with these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The True Problem: Elite Decay

The fundamental issue in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] is the [[social_decay_and_violence_in_trkiye | moral and cultural decay]] of the elite class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This class, which should guide the nation, provide ideals, and serve as an example, is failing in its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Specifically, the middle class, or "nouveau riche," is identified as extremely uncouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The core problem is not peasantry or lack of civility, but rather that the [[role_of_educated_classes_in_turkey | educated classes are poorly educated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Failure of Elite Education in the Republic

The Republic of [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]]'s biggest failure in education has been its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While efforts after 1950 successfully brought basic education to large masses, such as opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a society requires more than just minimum education for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is crucial to raise an elite group that can lead society and shape its intellectual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Historical Context and Republican Policies

Until recently, the only opportunities for elite education in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] were a few select schools established during the Ottoman period, many by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The Republic did not allow these institutions to develop or increase in number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>; instead, they became smaller, with narrower budgets and more limited scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Outcomes for Domestic and Foreign-Educated Individuals

As a result, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] have steadily declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This level of education is now largely achieved only by a very small, fortunate minority who had the opportunity to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. However, individuals educated abroad often struggle to adapt to local conditions upon their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, making it difficult for them to assume leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Meanwhile, the domestic education system is criticized as little more than a "stupid brainwashing program" that teaches how to be a civil servant and "bow down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This system has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding and influencing the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## The Public's Thirst for Knowledge

Despite the failings of the elite, the general populace demonstrates a deep respect for scholars and a continuous search for wise and cultured individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This "love of the Anatolian people for scholars" and their "respect for scholars is endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The public shows immense curiosity and hunger for knowledge on various topics, including the universe, existence, Turkish history, [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | social structure]], the Armenian Genocide, the Kurdish issue, the Syrian issue, and historical figures like Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They listen eagerly, as if finding "an oasis in the desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Decline in Traditional Religious Scholarship

If the "westernized" and quantitatively and qualitatively limited elite cannot fulfill this demand for guidance, ordinary people turn to traditional figures like "teacher, Hacı Hacı" (religious scholars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, the quality of these religious scholars has also declined significantly due to the suppression of elite religious education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The quality of Islamic religious experts at the end of the 19th century vastly surpasses those of today, a direct result of the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The "Half-Educated" and "Real Elites"

The "ignorance and moral degradation of the half-educated Turks," particularly those who consider themselves "white-collar," is described as terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This segment of society, estimated at one to two million people, is seen as the "scourge of [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. They exhibit no social responsibility, no instinct to teach or give, and are self-serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is attributed to their education, as there is no system in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] that fosters a mission to guide people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Above this group are the "real elites," a staff of about 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. They are terribly alienated from society and harbor no hope or vision other than leaving [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If they cannot leave themselves, they try to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This situation represents a significant tragedy for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

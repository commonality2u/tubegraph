The Iranian director Asghar Farhadi (referred to as Asker Ferhat in the transcript) is noted for his films, with "The Salesman" (The Seulzmann) being highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The Persian title "information furu≈ü" (seller of information) is mentioned, which is related to "Forushande" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The speaker highly praises "The Salesman," describing it as gloomy and slow but remarkable in terms of human sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It is the third film by Farhadi the speaker has watched, considering all three to be masterpieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Notable Films by Asghar Farhadi

*   **"A Separation" (Bir Separation)**: This film, detailing a divorce incident, is remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **"Everybody Knows" (Every beddin)**: This film, described as "wonderful," is widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While the speaker initially suggests one of his films set outside Iran takes place in Spain's Valisia region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, a later correction suggests it might be Italy, before concluding that he's mixing them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. "Everybody Knows" is indeed set in Spain.
*   **"The Salesman"**: This film is considered very successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Themes and Observations on Farhadi's Work

Farhadi's films, particularly "The Salesman," explore the softness and civility of human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Specific scenes like the teacher-student relationships and family attitudes when a "bad guy" is caught exemplify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The depiction of human behavior in his films is seen as something no longer possible to be shown in Western cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

His films offer a vision of what Iran is like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Despite showing a "terrible misery" and a "depressing effect" caused by cheapness permeating life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, the films also suggest that Iranian society is "a more civilized society than today's West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, regardless of the political system.

The slow tempo of the film is noted, but it is ultimately praised as a "wonderful film" and a "real literary start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

The speaker notes the uniqueness of Iranian films, suggesting Hollywood could not produce such works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> due to the nuanced portrayal of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and behavioral patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The films offer insight into [[Cultural Transformation in the Middle East Turkey and Iran | Iranian society]] and its characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, portraying a society that, despite visible hardships, exhibits a higher degree of civility than the contemporary West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

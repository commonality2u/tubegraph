In recent years, [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]] have faced significant challenges related to [[significance_of_immigration_in_western_countries | immigration]], leading to complex societal and economic issues.

## Current [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | Immigration Trends]]

The United States is experiencing an "invasion" with approximately 250,000 to 300,000 people entering monthly through open borders [00:07:38]. The federal government, under the Biden administration, appears to have completely relaxed border controls, suggesting an open border policy [00:08:10]. This situation has led to direct conflict, such as the Governor of Texas stating he would protect the border independently when the central government failed to do so [00:08:31]. The federal government even considered sending army troops against Texas [00:08:38].

A similar situation is observed in England [00:09:46]. In some Western countries, the number of irregular immigrants in a year significantly surpasses the number of children born locally, leading to what is described as literal [[population_control_and_demographic_challenges | population replacement]] [00:09:54].

## Economic Drivers and Consequences

The primary economic reason cited for large-scale [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration]] is the need for cheap labor [00:10:22]. This stems from [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries']] decision over the last 30 years to export industries to regions with lower labor costs, such as China, the Far East, and Mexico [00:10:33]. This strategy, aimed at maximizing profits, ultimately led to the disappearance of local industries and employment opportunities in countries like America, England, and Canada, resulting in "great economic and social disaster" [00:11:29].

Consequently, the local populations in [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]] are often unwilling to perform labor-intensive jobs for low wages [00:12:17], in part due to established rights like retirement and health benefits that make employment costly for employers [00:12:38]. This creates a problematic situation where importing cheap labor becomes a perceived necessity [00:12:50].

## [[Migration and integration challenges | Societal Challenges and Integration]]

A significant concern is whether the social fabric of [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]] can sustain such large-scale [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | migration]] [00:13:00]. Historically, empires like the Roman Empire collapsed due to migrations of much lower numbers [00:13:12], and similar results were seen with Turkish migration in the Abbasid state [00:13:43].

### [[cultural_assimilation_issues_in_europe | Cultural Assimilation Issues]]

Europe, in particular, is noted to have "lost its capacity for assimilation" [01:19:17]. Historically, societies receiving migrants would educate and integrate newcomers, especially their children, into their own social structures and customs [01:19:22]. However, this capacity is no longer present [01:20:16]. Only immigrants with a certain level of education can be assimilated; others, especially in large numbers, cannot be integrated due to the structure of European societies [01:20:26].

Immigrants often seek to protect their own culture, solidarity networks, and kinship ties, leading to the formation of "their own worlds" within existing societies [01:20:41]. This is exacerbated by the fact that European societies primarily offer money to these newcomers, rather than culture, education, or opportunities that are inaccessible to those living in poverty and working long hours [01:21:15]. Without a "spiritual value" or ability to integrate meaningfully, immigrants naturally seek refuge in their own cultures and traditions [01:22:28].

This challenge has reached a crisis point [01:22:56]. One possibility is a complete halt to [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration]], but this is deemed economically impossible as no European class can perform the jobs immigrants do [01:23:21]. The other possibility is a gradual demographic shift where immigrants increasingly populate cities and public spaces [01:23:33]. European cities like Paris, London, and Rome are already perceived as "invaded by immigrants," with native populations retreating to inner areas [01:23:56]. This could lead to immigrants eventually taking over schools, universities, and political parties [01:24:32].

## Political Responses

Political discourse in [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]] is increasingly divided along the axis of [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration]] [01:15:46]. Anti-immigrant sentiment is rapidly gaining political traction in European countries like Germany and France [01:16:30]. In the United States, Donald Trump, whose discourse includes strong anti-immigrant stances, is predicted to win elections by a wide margin [01:17:01].

Despite the political rhetoric, the speaker believes that countries will be unable to stop [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration]] due to economic necessity [01:17:19]. Without it, their economies would collapse [01:17:29]. Therefore, even politicians who rise to power on anti-immigrant platforms may find it difficult to implement drastic measures once in office [01:17:49].

## Future Outlook

The current [[migration and integration challenges | challenges]] are considered a "crisis" that [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]] may struggle to handle [00:28:03]. It is suggested that in the long run, "the side that has nothing to lose will win," and "the barbarians will always win" in this struggle [01:18:14]. The speaker suggests that if societies face an existential crisis, they will develop different reflexes [01:12:47].

The possibility of a civil war in the USA is given a 50/50 chance [01:13:36].

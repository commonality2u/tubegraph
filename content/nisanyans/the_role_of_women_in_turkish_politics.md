Recent cabinet appointments in [[current_political_landscape_in_Turkey | Turkey]] have brought the role of women in [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | politics]] to the forefront of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. While the current cabinet notably includes only one woman, with criticisms regarding the lack of female representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, it is also observed that a woman will be appointed to lead [[political_and_social_issues_in_Turkey | Turkey's]] Central Bank for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

## Modern Trends in Female Political Leadership
The rise of women in cabinet positions and as heads of state has become a global trend, often presented as a benchmark of modernity, democracy, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. However, a critical perspective questions the performance and effectiveness of many contemporary female politicians globally. Many are viewed as some of the "worst and corrupt politicians in history," characterized by "stupidity, incompetence, and indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

While acknowledging that it's impossible to generalize about women and that many are intelligent and competent in their fields, there's a noted absence of strong, independent female figures in prominent global political roles, with Angela Merkel cited as a rare exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. The argument is made that many women promoted in politics today are "mass-produced" figures lacking intellectual capacity and administrative skills, serving merely as "images" rather than governing effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. This phenomenon is compared to the appointment of incompetent male leaders, suggesting a shared strategy of "selling images" rather than substance in modern [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

## Historical Context of Women's Roles
### Matriarchal Societies in History
The claim that ancient Turks were matriarchal is a "fashionable" but unfounded assertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. No matriarchal societies have been identified at any point in history, although societies where property and lineage are traced through the mother exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. The division of labor between genders has remained broadly similar across societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

### Women in Primitive Societies
In primitive and tribal societies, the separation of public and private roles for women was less pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Women in such societies often took active roles in male-dominated functions like riding horses, fighting, and speaking freely in assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This can be seen in pre-Islamic Arab societies, ancient Greek epics, and also among the early Turks before the development of complex social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. Tales like those of Dede Korkut illustrate the active and outspoken nature of women in these tribal settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

### Impact of Civilization on Women's Roles
The advent of "civilization" brought with it a more rigorous division of labor and professionalization of state, societal, and religious management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This historical development, seen across various cultures and eras (e.g., advent of Islam, Christianity, Roman Empire, European colonialism in America, China, India), consistently led to the restriction of women's visible roles in the public sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. The public and household spheres became distinct, with women largely relegated to the home, where their "dominance" was acknowledged, but their public participation was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

This traditional structure became unsustainable in the 20th and 21st centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. However, it is considered "absurd" to seek solutions for contemporary needs by looking back at pre-Islamic or pre-civilization traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

## Initial Analysis and Challenges

The [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] incident was an "unexpected, uncalculated development" that reminded observers to be more modest in political analyses, as what happens behind the scenes is often unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It is difficult to conduct political analysis when there is a wide gap between what is spoken and what is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The speaker does not believe that the current group in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] can establish permanent sovereignty or comprehensive state authority for the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. While there appears to be international consensus among [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]], [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]], the United States, and [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Russia]] on some decisions regarding [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]], the results of these decisions are not yet visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. A "looting group" with a specific past performance, organizational forms, and financial resources is unlikely to establish sovereignty in a "patchwork quilt" country like [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## International Interventions and Their Outcomes

### Historical Pattern of State Collapse
As a result of international interventions in recent years, a pattern of states being torn apart has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   This trend began with Sudan, which was separated into North and South Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. South Sudan quickly devolved into civil war, with three armed sides fighting each other, leading to a large refugee population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iraq]] disappeared as a state and was divided into three, though it has since achieved some stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   Libya, Somalia, and Yemen have also been torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

This consistent outcome suggests a conscious policy, where the aim is not to create a properly governed country, but rather to prevent the people from harming each other, or at least that this is the objective outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]]'s Gains
In the [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] incident, the clear winner is [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] had been a point of support and a forward base for [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iran]], which was a threat to [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]], and this has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Additionally, [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]] destroyed all arsenals, tank bases, and military airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Under these conditions, the possibility of ensuring internal security in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] is seen as "zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]]'s Role and International Perceptions
[[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] took coordinated action with [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]] and embarked on an expedition, taking control of the northern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. It is expected that [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]] will control the southern regions directly or indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The speaker believes this model is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Former US President Trump sarcastically praised [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, suggesting that while others tried for a year, "one man did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This statement is interpreted not as well-intentioned, but as an effort to place the responsibility for future chaos and massacres in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] onto [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The exaggeration of [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]]'s role and the creation of an atmosphere suggesting [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] carried out the entire operation are noted, with [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Türkiye]]'s administrators seemingly pleased by this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

The speaker states that [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] is suffering because of this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Allies of [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] need to seriously consider [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]]'s future in a world where countries like Yemen and Somalia have become "state ruins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## The Future of Syria and Kurdish Autonomy
The speaker questions whether what happened to [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] will also happen to [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Regarding Rojava (Northeast [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]]), the speaker has consistently supported the idea of Kurds reaching an agreement with [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The idea was that Rojava would remain part of [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_ru | Syria]] on paper, with the Damascus administration and [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] mutually allowing for an autonomous region that poses no threat to either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. However, the speaker is now unsure if this possibility still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. The "Saladin alliance," a dream of Turks and Kurds uniting to dominate the Middle East, does not seem likely to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

The speaker sees the future of [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] as "dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

## Strategic Policy Critique
The speaker criticizes the strategic policies of [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Türkiye]], suggesting that those who form them live in an "unreal dream world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. These policies attempt to revive approaches that have failed for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The idea that [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Türkiye]] can be governed by the principle of a single nation, both domestically and internationally, is seen as flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

There is a clear disregard for the strong national identity gained by Kurdish populations in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iraq]], [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]], and even in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. To claim in the 21st century that Kurds will give up their national identity and that their desire for a separate nation is "terrorism" is considered a "very imaginative perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

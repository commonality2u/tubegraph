## Expectations vs. Reality of the Centenary

Leading up to its 100th anniversary, the Republic of Turkey was widely expected to celebrate with significant ceremonies and enthusiastic festivities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. There were expectations of major political events, possibly even the declaration of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, none of these anticipated events materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Compared to previous anniversaries, such as the 80th and 90th, the 100th anniversary was notably subdued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While there were a few attempts to link the centenary to the propaganda of Tayyip Erdoğan, such as visiting mausoleums, these were not taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It is evident that it was a government policy to render the 100th anniversary an ordinary and unimportant event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

In contrast, a small, fervent group attempted to generate excitement through demonstrations and social media content, but it was clear that the anniversary held little significance for the country as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. From a historical perspective, the muted celebrations are viewed as a correct policy, as the Republic is seen as merely an "episode" within the broader [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | history of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Continuities with the Ottoman State

From a historical perspective, the Republic of Turkey is considered an important episode in a continuous state tradition that has been ongoing since at least 1453, and potentially even longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Examples from other nations, such as France (from kingdom to republic) and Russia (monarchy to different regimes), illustrate that [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | continuities]] often outweigh differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Similarly, China's 2000-year state transformed into a republic in the 20th century, adapting to contemporary trends, but remains China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### The Name and Narrative of the State
Despite the change in the state's name, the country's foreign designation has always been "Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, which saw itself as a "World Empire," did not have a specific name, but was consistently called Türkiye by foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The state's self-narrative shows clear [[history_and_nationalism_in_trkiye | continuity]], linking figures like Fatih, Yavuz, Abdulhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Institutions like the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie Organization, Police Organization, land registry, and population administration all celebrate long histories that predate the Republic, demonstrating an obvious continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The Republic of Turkey is largely a "revised version of the Ottoman State according to the conditions of the New Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### The People and Ruling Cadres
The collective identity of the people, the "common will of that people," has not fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. While the people once identified as "Muslims," the term "Turkish" was later preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. These two groups largely overlap, representing "two different guises of the same cluster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Ottoman Muslims (excluding Arabs) were consistently referred to as Turks by their neighbors and foreign observers, regardless of their specific ethnic origin (Bosniaks, Albanians, Lazs, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_turkey | Turkish nation]], as defined by the Ottoman state, has a long history and continued its journey under a new name and political framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

The ruling cadres of the Republic were largely a continuation of the old state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Individuals who graduated from elite schools and served as commanders in the old regime established the new one, but maintained state continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Laws, Debts, and Culture
Most Ottoman laws, which had already undergone radical reform and rewritten with European models since the 1840s, remained the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The Republic of Turkey also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Many traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices of the Ottoman State continued into the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. While some changes occurred, there was an obvious continuity underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Turkish, the dominant language of the Ottoman Empire, continued to be spoken, with some style changes in usage from the 1930s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Key Changes with the Republic

Despite the continuities, some significant changes did occur with the Republic:

### Sociological Shift: From Sovereign to Single Nation
Perhaps the most important change was the radical alteration of society's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. In the Ottoman State, the Muslim/Turkish segment was the "Sovereign Nation" among various coexisting nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This structure began to shake with the Tanzimat reforms and experienced major upheavals, leading to the liquidation of non-Muslim elements from the population starting in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This process intensified just before the Republic and continued throughout the Republican period, culminating in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. As a result, the previously sovereign segment aimed to become a single nation during the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This was a profound, historical [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_in_turkey | transformation]] in the structure of Ottoman society and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### Expansion of Bureaucratic Cadres
Another change, also a continuation of a process initiated by the Tanzimat, was the expansion of the modern state's duties and the corresponding need for a growing, diversifying bureaucratic staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. This led to a tremendous increase in the number of literate people involved in state administration, a global trend in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

After a period of stagnation under Abdulhamid and years of war and civil war (1908-1923), the Republic saw a significant increase in the number of people integrated into state cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This expanded the administrative scope from roughly 10,000 to 100,000 literate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. While leading to a quantitative increase in education, it also caused a serious decrease in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. These new administrative segments, drawn from various societal levels, became the Republic's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters, as the system provided them with opportunities they wouldn't have otherwise had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This expansion of state cadres was a global phenomenon, not specific to Türkiye or its republican regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### Revolutionary Excitement
In the 1920s and 1930s, the administrative cadres of Turkey experienced a strong revolutionary excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This was fueled by the collapse of the old regime, its defeat in war, and the subsequent "clean page" mentality that fostered a belief in success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. This sentiment was also widespread globally after World War I, with a desire to rebuild on rational foundations and abandon old, hindering habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

However, the end result of this idealism was largely disappointment, characterized by "much talk and little action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. Comparing Türkiye's experience to Russia's 18th-century [[development_and_reforms_in_republican_turkey | transformations]] under Catherine the Great or the Stalinist period in the 20th century highlights the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Russia managed to build cities and infrastructure from scratch, fostering a civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Türkiye, despite similar claims and ambitions from 1923 to 1950, did not achieve comparable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. The revolutionary excitement faded because the reforms were superficial and the cadres insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Many founders acquired power and wealth through the plunder resulting from the elimination of non-Muslims, prioritizing their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. The initial dynamism imported from the West was largely abandoned after Mustafa Kemal Pasha's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. The failure was attributed to the inadequacy of the administrative cadres rather than societal backwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

### Change in Head of State Election Method
The most specific and unique change brought by the Republic was the alteration of the method for electing a head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. Historically, the hereditary succession of a strong leader was preferred globally to ensure stability and avoid conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. This model collapsed worldwide, especially in countries that Türkiye took as examples (Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, China) at the beginning of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

The "fashion of the age" or necessity led to the principle that anyone approved by the elites and, even if only for show, the public, could be the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. The distinguishing feature of a republic is the systemic change of administration, often through regular elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. However, in Türkiye and many other countries, those who came to power did not readily relinquish it; for instance, Mustafa Kemal Pasha served as president for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. This change in management technique is not seen as having serious real-world results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Analysis of Changes' Impact

Improvements in areas like child mortality, life expectancy, population growth, public health, literacy rates, and urbanization since 1923 are not solely achievements of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. These are global trends that have occurred in nearly 200 states, regardless of whether they are monarchies or republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

Comparing Türkiye's development to countries like Saudi Arabia (an absolutist monarchy), Japan (a monarchy), or Jordan (a kingdom) shows that similar progress in literacy, population, and economic growth occurred independently of the regime type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. These developments (new state understanding, increased state influence, transportation/communication advances, and the rise of education) are characteristic of the 20th century across all countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

In summary, the most significant changes attributed to the Republic between before and after 1923 were:
1.  [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | The Turks]] ceasing to be a sovereign nation and becoming a single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
2.  The expansion and growth of educated public cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
These phenomena would have occurred regardless of whether a republican regime was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the 1920s and 1930s, though it affected a narrow segment, ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

Consequently, attempts to present the 100th anniversary as a highly important historical turning point are not to be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

### Ankara's Role
Ankara was not created from nothing as a capital city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. In 1914-1919, it was one of the three largest cities in Central Anatolia (along with Kayseri and Konya), possibly the most developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. With a population of 40,000-50,000, Ankara was an ancient city, a major center since Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>. It had a unique modern-style, planned Armenian neighborhood called Keçiören, founded around 1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. This played a role in its selection as the headquarters of the national struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

Ankara was economically prosperous due to its near-monopoly on mohair, a significant export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. The arrival of the Anatolian railway in 1880 also marked a period of important development for the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

### The Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)
The victory against Greece in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) is often exaggerated in its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. Given Türkiye's population (4 times that of Greece) and economic size (3-4 times larger), and its long [[political_history_of_turkey | military tradition]] compared to Greece's nascent military, the outcome of such a war was predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>. The real factor in the war was the involvement of the British, who encouraged and supplied the Greeks as proxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. The Turkish side's concern was the extent of British involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

This war is comparable to the current Ukraine War, where Ukraine acts as a pawn of the Western alliance against Russia, and the outcome depends on the external support rather than direct comparison of forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. When it became clear Greece would not succeed, British aid was cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

The Greek War was largely turned into a "great pageant" and "national epic of defeat" for political reasons, particularly to bolster Mustafa Kemal Pasha's personal success and lay the foundations for his [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | political future]] and dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

The 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, while an important historical event, is considered by some to be overemphasized as a major turning point or a matter of "existence and non-existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. The **political_history_of_turkey** shows deep continuities with the Ottoman past, with key changes such as the **concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_turkey** and the expansion of bureaucratic cadres being more reflective of global 20th-century trends than specific achievements of the republican regime.

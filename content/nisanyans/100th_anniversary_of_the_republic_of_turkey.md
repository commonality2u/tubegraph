The 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey was anticipated by many to be a momentous occasion, marked by grand ceremonies, enthusiastic celebrations, significant [[political_changes_in_turkey | political events]], and even the declaration of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, these expectations were largely unmet, with the anniversary being treated as an "ordinary and unimportant event" by government policy, especially when compared to the 80th and 90th anniversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Although there were some attempts to link the celebration with Tayyip Erdoğan's propaganda, such as visits to mausoleums, these were not considered serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Despite efforts by a small group to generate enthusiasm through demonstrations and poems about Atatürk, the 100th anniversary did not resonate significantly with the country as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The speaker, in fact, viewed this low-key approach as the "right policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Historical Continuity vs. Revolutionary Change

From a broader [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | historical perspective]], the Republic of Turkey is considered an "episode" within a continuous state tradition that spans at least since 1453, if not longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This viewpoint suggests that the Republic is an important, but not fundamentally discontinuous, phase in [[turkish_historical_events | Turkish history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Comparisons are drawn with other nations:
*   **France**: Transitioned from a kingdom to a republic, but continuities outweigh differences, and monarchy and republic are "two parts of a process that naturally articulate to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Russia**: Experienced centuries of monarchy, then multiple revolutions and regime changes, yet remains fundamentally "Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **China**: Transformed from a 2000-year-old state into a republic in the 20th century, adapting to "fashions and requirements of the age," but remains "China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the Republic is simply another "period" in the general [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | history of Turkey]], akin to the Abdulhamid, rise, stagnation, or decline periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While the state's name changed, its international designation has consistently been "Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Continuities are observed in:
*   **State Narrative**: The official narrative of the state, from Fatih and Yavuz to Abdulhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Tayyip Erdoğan, shows a clear continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Institutions**: Organizations like the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, land registry, and population administration all celebrate long histories, demonstrating unbroken institutional continuity despite regime changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Ideology and Self-Perception**: The state's institutional ideology and self-perception have also shown continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The Republic of Turkey is seen as a "revised version of the Ottoman State according to the conditions of the New Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Population Identity**: The people, originally identifying as "Muslims," later adopted the name "Turkish," but these two groups largely overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Historically, foreigners (Armenians, Greeks, French, Italian, English) always referred to the Ottoman Muslims as "Turks," regardless of their specific ethnic subgroups within the Ottoman Empire (e.g., Bosniaks, Albanians, Lazs), excluding Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Ruling Cadres**: The Republic saw a continuation of the old state's ruling cadres. Elite school graduates and commanders from the old regime established the new one, consciously maintaining state continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Legal System**: Many Ottoman laws, particularly those reformed and rewritten based on European models since the 1840s (Commercial Code, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, Penal Code from France), remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Debts**: The Republic of Turkey assumed the debts of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Traditions and Language**: Many Ottoman traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices continued into the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Turkish remained the dominant language, with significant but gradual reforms in its usage style from the 1930s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The "Turkish nation," in this historical context, refers to the people defined by the Ottoman state, not Central Asian Turks, who continued their journey under a new name and political ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Key Changes Introduced by the Republic

Despite the strong emphasis on continuity, the Republic did bring about significant changes:

### Sociological Transformation: From Sovereign Nation to Single Nation
The most profound change was the transformation of the Muslim/Turkish segment from a "Sovereign Nation" in a multi-national Ottoman order to the single, dominant nation of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This shift began with the Tanzimat reforms, saw major upheavals during the late Abdulhamid period, and intensified with the systematic "cleaning" of non-Muslim elements from the Anatolian and Rumelian population starting in the 19th century and continuing until the 1980s through events like the population exchange with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This redefinition of the nation had a deep impact on the country's sociological structure and state ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

### Expansion of Bureaucratic Cadres
Another major [[modernization_efforts_in_turkish_history | modernization effort]] was the expansion and diversification of the bureaucratic staff, a process that started with the Tanzimat and mirrored global [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | developments]] of the modern state in the 19th and 20th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. While this led to a quantitative increase in literate people within state cadres (e.g., from 10,000 to 100,000 administrators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, it also resulted in a "serious decrease in quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. These newly educated segments, drawn from various parts of Anatolia and Rumelia, became loyal supporters of the Republican regime, viewing it as their "savior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. However, this expansion was a global trend, independent of the specific regime (republic, sultanate, or communist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

### Revolutionary Excitement and Idealism
The 1920s and 1930s saw Turkey's administrative cadres gripped by a "great revolutionary excitement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This stemmed from the collapse of the old regime and the state's subsequent re-establishment, fostering a belief in opening a "clean page" and succeeding anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. This spirit aligned with a global post-World War I sentiment to abandon old institutions and rebuild on rational foundations with a new spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

However, the "tremendous idealism" among circles close to the regime, which lasted until the 1940s, largely resulted in "disappointment" and "much talk and little action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. The speaker contrasts this with [[modernization_efforts_in_turkish_history | modernization efforts]] in Russia under Catherine the Great and Stalin, where new cities, infrastructure, and cultural institutions were built from scratch, transforming society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Turkey's claims to similar transformation were not fully realized; the initial revolutionary excitement, primarily affecting a narrow segment, faded after 1938-39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

The reforms were deemed "superficial," and the administrative cadres "insufficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Many of the Republic's founders gained wealth through the "plunder" during the elimination of non-Muslims, prioritizing the protection of these gains over genuine revolutionary change, often using "homeland, nation and Sakarya" discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Mustafa Kemal Pasha and a small core cadre attempted to instill dynamism, but after his death, traditional thinking and management styles resurfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. The inadequacy of administrative cadres, rather than societal backwardness, is cited as a key reason for the limited success of these ambitious projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

### Change in Head of State Election Method
The core "specific and different" aspect of the Republic is the change in the method of electing a head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Traditionally, across the world, a strong, hereditary leader was seen as essential for governing complex states to avoid power struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. However, this model collapsed globally at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly after World War I, with monarchies falling in Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

The "fashion of the age," driven by new social structures, ideological trends, and management techniques, replaced monarchy with the principle that elites, with some form of public approval, could select the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. While a true republic involves a systematic, periodic change of administration (e.g., every 4 years as in America) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>, this did not fully materialize in Turkey, where leaders like Mustafa Kemal Pasha remained in power for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

The speaker concludes that changing the method of electing the head of state has not yielded "any serious results" in terms of real-world outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. The method of succession changed from hereditary to selection by a small group of notables approved by the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This change is considered to have little sociological impact; countries that retained monarchies (like Iran until the 1970s or Jordan) showed similar [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | development patterns]] in literacy, economic growth, and public health as republican regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## Societal Indicators and the Republic's Role

While statistics like decreased child mortality, increased life expectancy, rapid population growth, improved public health, higher literacy rates, urbanization, and increased university graduates are evident since 1923, these are not unique achievements of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. These [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | developments]] have occurred in nearly all 200 states globally, irrespective of whether they are monarchies or republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. The era itself brought new state understandings, increased state influence, and advancements in transportation, communication, and education, leading to a universal need for literate personnel and new educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

In summary, the establishment of the Republic is an important [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | historical event]] and marked a new page in the [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | historical development]] of the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. However, the two most significant changes—the transformation of the Turkish identity from a "Sovereign Nation" to a single nation, and the expansion of educated public cadres—would likely have occurred even without a republican regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The revolutionary excitement of the 1920s and 1930s affected only a narrow segment and ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. Therefore, attempts to portray the 100th anniversary as a "very important turning point" or a matter of "existence and non-existence" are not to be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

## Ancillary Historical Notes

### Ankara as Capital
Ankara was not created "from nothing" as a capital city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. It was one of the three largest cities in Central Anatolia (alongside Kayseri and Konya) around 1914-1919, likely the most [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | developed]] culturally and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. With a population of 40,000-50,000, it was an ancient city and a major center since Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. Its economic assets included a near-monopoly in mohair, a significant export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, and it benefited from the arrival of the Anatolian railway in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. The presence of Keçören, a modern, planned Armenian neighborhood founded in 1910, might have contributed to its selection as the base for the national struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

Other cities founded from scratch include:
*   **Saint Petersburg**: Founded in a swamp by order of the ruler, it became one of Europe's most magnificent cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Chinese Capitals**: Historically, almost every Chinese dynasty established a new, planned capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Istanbul (Constantinople)**: Though a city existed before, Constantine transformed it into a monumental capital of the world in 325 AD, essentially founding it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   **Elazığ**: Founded as a military garrison and administrative center during Sultan Abdulaziz's reign in the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

### The Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)
The speaker views the defeat of Greece as a foregone conclusion, considering Turkey's population was four times that of Greece, and its economy three to four times larger in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. Greece lacked a military tradition, while Turkey had a thousand-year history of military service as a core element of its national culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

The real "trick" of the 1919-1922 war was the involvement of the British and French allies, who drove the Greeks to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. The Turkish side took the war seriously due to uncertainty about how far British intervention would go, as Turkey alone could not defeat both Greece and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. The war is compared to the modern Ukraine War, where Russia would defeat Ukraine if not for extensive Western support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Britain and France gave Greece weapons and money but refrained from direct military involvement, abandoning them when success was deemed unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

Mustafa Kemal Pasha utilized the victory, particularly the Battle of the Commander-in-Chief, as a personal success and a propaganda tool, laying the foundation for his [[political_changes_in_turkey | political future]] and eventual dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. The declaration of August 30, 1922, as a "great national epic" was a political maneuver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### The Gallipoli Campaign
The British-French naval attempt to cross the Dardanelles in March 1915 failed, leading to a land invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This "crazy project," driven by "extreme arrogance and pride" and advocated by Winston Churchill, aimed to capture Istanbul within 48 hours to remove the Ottoman Empire from World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Another unspoken concern was to prevent Russia from capturing Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. Landing in Izmir was not considered viable due to the long distance to Istanbul and the lack of sufficient allied forces for such a major operation, as their main strength was committed to the German front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. The Çanakkale (Gallipoli) operation was a quick, opportunist move that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

### The Cyrillic Alphabet
The Cyrillic alphabet is used by Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, and some former Soviet communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. It was created by two brothers, Cyril and Methodius, considered saints in the Orthodox tradition, from Thessaloniki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. In the 9th century, they were sent by Byzantium to the Moravians (in today's Czech Republic) to help them Christianize and create an alphabet for their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. Starting from the Greek alphabet, they incorporated letters from the Hebrew alphabet for Slavic sounds not present in Greek (e.g., s, ç, ş, ü) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. Although the Moravian Kingdom later declined, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Russians continued to use this writing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. Cyril and Methodius were once administrators of a monastery in Bursa, connecting them to Istanbul and Thessaloniki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. The 8th and 9th centuries saw a global emergence of new alphabets and writing systems, including for Anglo-Saxons, Scandinavians, and Turks (Orkhon Inscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

### The 1990s in Turkey and the World
From the mid-1980s, the "Özal movement" marked a period of dominant liberalism in Turkey and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This era encouraged focusing on making money, having fun, and less adherence to traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. The world saw rapid integration, easier international travel, and a trend towards new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. This optimistic outlook, especially among the middle and upper classes, fueled a sense that Turkey would become free, integrate with the West, and join the European Union, overcoming the "dark ideological obsessions of the 1970s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>. Freedom of the press and expression also appeared to be expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

However, this optimism began to wane during the Mesut Yılmaz governments, slowly giving way to pessimism by the mid-1990s, with a renewed sense that "nothing will change in this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. The Kurdish issue escalated significantly around 1993, leading to a "terror campaign," deportation policies in Eastern provinces, destruction of villages, forced migration, and the assassination of Kurdish figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. This period saw a resurgence of "terror and oppression" and the military's re-entry into political life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. The 1990s grew progressively darker, culminating in the explosion of the existing political party system, which ultimately led to the rise of the Justice and Development Party around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>. The 1990s are summarized as "not a good period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

## Reflections on Historical Inquiry
The speaker notes that many people are intensely interested in niche historical areas, particularly concerning Turkey's past and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>. This interest stems from the "stupid lies" of standard official discourses about identity, creating a gap between personal family histories and what is learned in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. The speaker's extensive work on the history of Turkey's settlements, aiming to purify historical narratives from official ideology, provides a resource for those seeking to resolve these contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

Beneath the official narrative, there are numerous human stories reflecting the real psychology of people and local ethnic and cultural divisions, clashes, and envies across regions (e.g., Arabs and Kurds, Laz and Chileans, Circassians, Yörüks and Turkmens, Alevis and Sunnis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. The official education curriculum and national ideology deny these complexities, pushing them into a "stupid narrative, a myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. Discovering these local histories and challenging the official narrative is seen as a "revolutionary service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

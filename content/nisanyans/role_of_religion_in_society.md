From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Religion, in its historical context, functions primarily as a comprehensive social authority system, rather than merely a set of private beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. Reducing it solely to beliefs, especially in the Western world, has led to its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Religion as an Authority System

Historically, religion has been the most fundamental organizational principle of societies, especially for 99% of written human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. It permeates every aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>, functioning as an authority system that establishes the basic rules of civil existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This includes determining what is valid or invalid, which arguments hold weight, and whose word is authoritative within a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. It dictates which viewpoints to silence and which to affirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

In this sense, religion provides common narratives, myths, value judgments, and criteria for authority, thereby adjusting the balance of power within a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

## Core Functions of Religion

The speaker outlines several key functions of religion throughout history:

1.  **Domestication and Education** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>: A primary function is to instill specific value judgments, myths, and stories into children and young people, shaping the main axis of social discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. Historically, the first place a child went after leaving their mother's arms was often a religious educational institution, where they learned sacred texts, revered figures, and symbols for moral discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
2.  **Structuring Daily Life** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>: Religion has provided a system of rules that dictates the daily, weekly, and annual rhythms of people's lives. This includes specific prayers, symbols to observe, mandatory attendance at religious services (e.g., church on Sundays), and the celebration of holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
3.  **Managing Biological Milestones** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>: Religion transforms fundamental biological events—such as birth, marriage, and death—into ceremonies and social events, embedding them within a societal narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. For example, sexual intercourse within a civilized society requires social approval through specific forms and consequences, rather than being a spontaneous act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

## Belief vs. System

The speaker argues that in today's world, when people refer to [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | religion]], they often misunderstand it as merely a set of "beliefs" (e.g., in God, angels, prophets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This perception of belief as the primary aspect of religion, particularly prevalent in the Western world since the 19th century and in Türkiye in the latter half of the 20th century, is seen as a superficial layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

While belief in God, angels, and prophets can facilitate the functioning and internalization of the religious system, it is not mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. The religious system can persist as long as individuals adhere to its practices, narratives, myths, and educational requirements, irrespective of their personal belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The speaker states: "When you reduce religion to private beliefs, you destroy religion. It becomes something impossible to sustain. Because when I hit rational analysis, those beliefs are beliefs that are impossible to defend." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>

The speaker points out that even in deeply religious medieval times, non-belief in gods was considered a valid "religious sect" within certain traditional Indian religions, provided there was a community, gurus, an educational system, and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. This suggests that the *social structure* and *tradition* of religion are more central to its function than individual [[religious_belief_and_rationality | belief]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## Evolution of Freedom and Religion

The concept of freedom has evolved over time, and its relationship with religion has changed:

*   **Early Freedom (17th-18th Century)**: The initial demand for freedom, especially [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | religious freedom]], arose from religious sects in places like England, the Netherlands, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. These groups sought autonomy from the state, desiring to be "left alone" to manage their own communities according to their own laws, traditions, and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. At this stage, the idea of an individual living independently of *any* religious authority had not yet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **19th Century - Elite Freedom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>: After the French Revolution, the idea developed that educated elites and intellectuals were not bound to submit to religious authority, customs, or beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. This was initially a demand for a minority, not a general societal freeing from religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This concept became a defining feature of the modern age and a fundamental claim of liberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **20th Century - Broader Freedom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>: Following World War I, there was a widespread "wind of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. This new wave was not primarily against religion, but against traditional "values of the soul," the state, and established social hierarchies (aristocracy, wealthy classes, older white men) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. This rebellion was seen in clothing (e.g., shorter skirts, provocative attire), entertainment (rise of cafes and restaurants as social hubs), and art (criticism and mockery of societal values) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Perspectives on Islam and Democracy

The speaker addresses the question of whether Muslims can be Democrats, asserting that "Democrat" and "democracy" refer to a system of government, not an inherent quality of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Tolerance and flexibility, or rigidity, are partly innate personality traits and partly related to education, social conditions, and psychological state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

Regardless of Islamic theory, individuals within the Muslim world exhibit the full spectrum of human behavior, from the most tolerant to the most exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. Therefore, the issue is not whether "Muslims can be democrats," but rather the establishment of an effective management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This touches on the broader [[differences_between_religious_and_secular_individuals_in_society | differences between religious and secular individuals in society]] and the [[role_and_perception_of_islam_in_modern_society | role and perception of Islam in modern society]].

> [!INFO] The speaker clarifies the distinction between individual characteristics and system attributes: "Democracy is the name of a management system. There is no such thing as Muslims being democrats. At most, Muslims can be more tolerant or more tolerant." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>

> "We have been raining non-stop for two weeks. The sun comes out for 10 minutes every now and then. The weather is dark, the night is dark... I think this weather affects people's morale. We are in such a gloomy period. We have to get out of it somehow." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

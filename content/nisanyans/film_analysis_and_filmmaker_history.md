## On the Milky Way / Love and War (2016)

The film *On the Milky Way*, also known by its Turkish translation *Love and War* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, was watched and analyzed. The speaker found the Turkish translation to be determined by someone with a "wide imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The movie is described as "very beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, though its story "falls apart especially towards the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, it is praised for its "sincerity, honesty, honesty and the message it gives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Emir Kusturica: Filmmaker and Political Stance

The film was directed by Emir Kusturica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, a filmmaker who, in the early 2000s, was considered the "world's number one most fashionable filmmaker," garnering numerous awards and global admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Kusturica's career faced a significant downturn after he "loudly voiced the West's brutality and immorality regarding Yugoslavia and especially the Bosnia War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This public stance led to his being "destroyed," "erased from public memory," with his movies no longer shown and awards reportedly taken back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Feeling "bored with this world and this life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, Kusturica retired to a village he built himself on the Serbian side of Bosnia, where he also constructed a church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The speaker attempted to visit him and his village during a trip to Bosnia, but was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Watching *On the Milky Way* provides insight into why Kusturica felt the need to withdraw from the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The speaker typically downloads films using Stremio, which is why the English title of the film is more significant to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

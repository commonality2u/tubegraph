Throughout the Islamic world, from Marrakech to Samarkand and Bukhara, striking similarities in urban planning, culture, and architecture are evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:23">[06:15:23]</a>. This widespread consistency raises questions about how Islamic civilization achieved such cultural hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Unifying Elements of Islamic Cities

Across a vast geography, encompassing nearly one-third of the old world, several key elements define Islamic cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>:

*   **Bazaars (Markets)**: The market is considered the indispensable basic institution of Islamic cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. These are characterized by narrow, labyrinthine streets filled with small shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Tradesmen, often organized by profession, sell both handicrafts and industrial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This structure is seen in Marrakech, Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Urfa, Mardin, Baghdad, and Iranian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. While it's debated if bazaars existed before Islam, their preservation in this form specifically within Islamic countries is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Figurative Art**: Islamic cities are marked by highly developed non-figurative arts, which avoid depicting nature and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Instead, this sophisticated and decorative art style relies on the continuous repetition of abstract figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This art is very clearly Islamic in origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a> and is evident in old palaces, madrasahs, and elite houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **The Mosque**: Mosques serve as the basic regulators of natural life and are central to the act of prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

## Cultural Hegemony and Identity Adoption

The pervasive influence of Islamic culture is particularly visible in how local populations adopted Arab and Islamic identities to consolidate power.

### The Berber Case in Morocco

In Morocco, the indigenous Berbers initially resisted Islamic rule for several centuries after the Arab conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. However, later dynasties that ruled Morocco, even when of native Berber origin, consistently adopted Arab culture, identity, and the Islamic religion as their flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. This was because Arab and Islamic identity became a "symbol of civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. When attempting to establish sovereignty beyond tribal limits, the factors of Islam and Arab civilization were seen as essential tools to convince people and secure submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

> For instance, Berber feudal dynasties, even when starting from small local areas, would claim Arab origin (e.g., descendants of Hazret Ali) to legitimize their rule as they expanded into empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

### Similarities with Turkey

This phenomenon has "great similarities with Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Just as in Turkey, rulers claimed Turkish and Muslim identity, here, Arab and Muslim identities were claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. Lineages were often traced back to Mecca or Medina, regardless of actual ethnic origin, mirroring how Turkish lineages were often traced to Khorasan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. Being Arab served as a complementary element to being Muslim, used for political and cultural purposes, akin to the use of Turkishness and Muslimness in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

### The Role of Arabic Language and Culture

[[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islam]] is a religion deeply intertwined with Arab culture and the Arabic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>. Its traditions, history, holy book, and prayers are predominantly in Arabic, having been shaped as the language of the Arab Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. Even when non-Arab peoples like Iranians, Turks, and Indians adopted Islam, they became "Arabized" to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. The core of Islam's culture is undeniably Arab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>, from personal names (Mustafa, Muhammed, Fatma, Ay≈üe) to common written language via the Arabic alphabet, which prevailed across the Islamic world from Morocco to Bengal until a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>. For 1300 years, higher education and standard education in these regions were predominantly in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.

## The Crescent and Star Symbol

The crescent and star is a prominent Middle Eastern symbol, believed to be the sacred symbol of ancient Arab or Assyrian principalities around Harran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. It became widespread in the Islamic world in the 9th century when the Abbasids adopted it as a state symbol for their money and flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. Its brief use in the Roman Empire during the 3rd century, again originating from Syria and Harran, further underscores its Middle Eastern roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Symbol of Unity
> The crescent and star symbol represents the dream of a unified Islamic Empire, a single "ummah" governed by a single legitimate source, an idea that has been strong in the Islamic world for 1400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.

This symbol, without direct connection to Turkish tradition, was passed from the Abbasid tradition to the [[ottoman_architecture_and_its_modern_influence | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. It is now seen on the flags of Pakistan and Tunisia, and many Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

## Ottoman Influence on Morocco

While there's a general admiration for the [[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman Empire]] and Turkey across the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>, direct Ottoman architectural influence in Morocco is not strongly felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. However, there was some indirect impact. In the 17th century, the Alawi dynasty in Morocco imitated the Ottomans, establishing a professional army directly connected to the Sultan, complete with Turkish commanders and officers, similar to the Janissary army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The Turkish title "Pasha" was also used for local officials and even a prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>, leading to places like "Pasha Palace" and "Pasha Street" in Marrakesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>.

Despite these influences, the Ottoman Empire's attempts to establish formal administrative structures or a lasting foothold in Morocco (e.g., in the 1560s-1570s) were temporary and ultimately unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This contrasts with the more stable and institutionalized state structure of the core Ottoman Empire, particularly in Western Anatolia and Rumelia, which had strong Byzantine roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

This article explores the historical development and consequences of [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_on_society | nationalism]] in Turkey, drawing insights from an analysis of political figures and societal dynamics. It delves into the motivations behind the adoption of [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | nationalist]] policies, their implementation, and their long-term effects on the country's social and political landscape.

## Historical Context: The Emergence of [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | Nationalism]]

The establishment of the modern Turkish state in the early 20th century was fundamentally shaped by [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_on_society | nationalist]] ideology. The primary objectives were to re-establish the power of a collapsed state and to protect the power and life of its leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This drive was seen as a continuation of a century-long struggle for modernization that the Ottomans had failed to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

To achieve these goals, a "national excitement" was created, even if artificial, in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While elites in Istanbul and Izmir were perceived as indifferent, ordinary citizens were swayed by narratives of homeland, nation, and victory against "infidels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This approach also leveraged a pre-existing tradition of intrigue and political terror inherited from the Union and Progress organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, with instances of hanging opponents to prevent state disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's Role
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's policies, particularly after 1929-1930, exhibited characteristics perceived as signs of "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. These included:
*   Theories of language and [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The Dersim massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The liquidation of İsmet İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The purchase of the Savarona yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   The decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Such actions are considered difficult to avoid given the corrupting effect of absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Atatürk was successful in his primary mission of saving and rebuilding the bankrupt state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a> and retaining power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, a goal shared by other historical figures like Abdülhamid II and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

## The Nature of Turkish [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | Nationalism]]
Turkish [[nationalism_and_its_impacts_on_society | nationalism]] is characterized by its fervent belief in the state's righteousness and the justification of any action taken in the name of the state and homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This sentiment is often expressed by the phrase, "If the issue is homeland, the rest is details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

The ideology's proponents, often described as "half-educated and polished with cheap modeling polish," tend to spew hatred and complexes against the outside world while failing to connect emotionally with their own populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They rely on the state's power for their political relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### [[Nationalism and its impacts on society | Nationalism]] as a Tool of Populism
Globally, [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | nationalism]] serves as a tool for populism, glorifying a people and attempting to provoke them through demagoguery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In Turkey, this manifests as a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The Kemalist sect, in particular, has positioned itself as an alternative to Islam, rejecting Islamic tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### "Hakime Arrogance"
A core tenet of this [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_turkey | nationalist]] thinking is "Hakime arrogance," a theory of society that asserts "we are right, the other is sharpened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This mindset prevents its adherents from understanding the rights of Turks or establishing emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It also leads to ignorance regarding crucial [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | political and social issues in Turkey]], such as the [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Kurdish Parliament]], and an inability to comprehend modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Critiques and Consequences
The "sacred holy sisters of the rope" (referring to state symbols and rhetoric) are seen as the flag of contemporary Turkish racism and state gatekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The practice of displaying "holy icons" in government offices symbolizes a radical process where normal human logic and conscience are set aside, allowing officials to act with impunity under the guise of representing the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This attitude fosters a "disgusting" environment where individual reasoning or conscience are disregarded in favor of state authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

The project of raising Turkey to the level of contemporary civilization, aimed at by the early Republic, is deemed a "complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The secular decline experienced by the Ottoman Empire since the 1600s continued into the Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

The 1926 Izmir assassination, regardless of its authenticity, served as an excuse to intimidate the opposition and purge old Union and Progress cadres who were seen as potential rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Key figures like Finance Minister Cavit and organizers of the National Struggle were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. This "purge movement" is compared to Stalin's initiatives or the "Night of the Long Knives" in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## Modern Kemalism and its Challenges
Some contemporary academics believe in the possibility of a "new and democratic Kemalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. However, this is largely seen as a "complete dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. These academics are described as having lost touch with the country, hating the majority of the population, and lacking the ability to guide society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. The idea of a totalitarian dictator from the 1930s becoming a more democratic symbol is considered "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

The notion that Turkey would have been "destroyed" without Mustafa Kemal is dismissed; the country would have become "another state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, given that the logic of state governance tends to follow objective laws, regardless of who is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Search for New Ideals
The Kemalist ideology, despite attempts at replacement (like Turgut Özal's globalist economy model in the 1980s, which failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>, and the Westernization project under the guise of the European Union until 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>), has become exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

In the absence of a truly original and revolutionary alternative, Islam has emerged as the sole unifying idea for the country, defining it and offering a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This helplessness and lack of alternatives persist, not just in Turkey, but globally, where existing thought systems and political parties are deemed inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. The world is seen as needing a "revolution" and a new glimmer of hope that the existing political landscape cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Across the Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, there is a belief that the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

Turkey's long [[historical_roots_and_impacts_of_nationalism | history]] reveals it has always been the most open face of the Islamic world to the West, adopting Western innovations first among Islamic nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. However, it's also noted that until just before the period when Mustafa Kemal dominated, non-Muslims constituted 25% of Turkey's population and over 30% of its economic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

During a recent broadcast, the host experienced significant [[technical_difficulties_during_live_streams | technical difficulties during live streams]] and challenges related to changes in the Zoom administration panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These [[recurring_technical_issues_and_computer_problems | recurring technical issues and computer problems]] impacted the smooth flow of the program and the ability to connect with guests.

## Initial Challenges with Zoom Changes

The host noted that Zoom's administration panel had changed, causing a "hard time understanding what was going on" despite spending four minutes trying to figure it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This led to immediate problems for participants:
*   A link previously sent to friends participating in the program was expected to not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   The host realized the need to send a new link to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Ongoing Connectivity Issues

Later in the broadcast, the host continued to struggle with the new Zoom interface while trying to invite a guest named Eren:
*   Confusion arose over how to invite the guest, with the host stating, "I don't know how to do it" and asking, "where do I enter the long myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27">[01:42:27]</a>.
*   The host sought to find the "White" option, presumably an invite or screen-sharing feature, in the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:56">[01:42:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>.
*   After finding "copyam White" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:27">[01:51:27]</a>, the host managed to send a link to Eren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:38">[01:51:38]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the situation was compounded by an incorrect link being sent prior to the live session:
*   A preliminary meeting with Eren was conducted, and the host had instructed Eren to return at 10 o'clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
*   However, the link sent for the main program was "the wrong link" and "didn't connect to anything," including YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

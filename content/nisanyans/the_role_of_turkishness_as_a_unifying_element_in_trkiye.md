From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of Turkishness has been a central, yet evolving, element in the political and [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural dynamics]] of Türkiye since its foundation. Initially, it was envisioned as a unifying principle for citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Early Republican Period (1920s - Early 1930s)

The foundations of the Republic were laid in 1923 with the hope that Turkishness would serve as a unifying element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. During the 1920s, a broader definition of "Turkish" was prevalent: anyone who adopted the Turkish language, Turkish culture, or the Turkish national ideal was considered Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This approach allowed for non-Muslims to be considered Turkish regardless of their origin, with certain exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Notably, the [[central_asianism_and_its_impact_on_turkish_national_identity | Central Asian]] theory of Turkish origins was not prevalent in official state publications or among Atatürk's associates during this period, specifically until 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Radical Shift in the 1930s

A significant and radical shift occurred after 1930, particularly from 1932-33 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A new, racist theory emerged, asserting that Turks originated from [[central_asianism_and_its_impact_on_turkish_national_identity | Central Asia]] and were the founders of all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This theory swiftly became the official [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | ideology]] from the first Turkish Language Congress and the first Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift

Three potential reasons for this radical ideological change are considered:

1.  **European Influence:**
    *   The rise of Hitler to power in Germany in 1933 altered global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Türkiye had previously considered models like the Soviet and Mussolini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The Mussolini model emphasized a single leader's will dominating society for major reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   From 1933, racism gained ground in Europe, with Nazism seen as the "wave of the future," and the idea of "purity" began to dominate world discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This wave was immediately felt in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

2.  **Resurgence of Old Cadres:**
    *   The [[central_asianism_and_its_impact_on_turkish_national_identity | Central Asian]] theory was popular among "imported Progress cadres," particularly those associated with the Turkish Hearth, in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   This thesis was "silenced" after 1922-23 during the War of Independence and the republic's founding period, with the Turkism of the Union and Progress movement being superseded by Ziya Gökalp's theory, which was then also "defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   From 1932 onwards, these previously silent cadres re-emerged, suggesting a change in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

3.  **Inadequacy of Founding [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | Ideology]]:**
    *   The republic's initial founding [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | ideology]] was perceived as insufficient to politically unify the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   It only resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments, failing to connect with broader society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   By 1930-31, the regime faced turmoil, evidenced by events like the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a return to Turkism would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Evolution of Turkishness as an Ideology

It's important to distinguish between the initial statist, leaderist, and totalitarian founding [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | ideology]] of the republic and the racist Turkist [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | ideology]] implemented in the 1930s; these are considered "two different waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Assimilation Policies and Their Outcomes

The shift towards a more exclusive definition of Turkishness was intended to assimilate groups like the Kurds, with the hope of crushing or assimilating them within one or two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, these assimilation efforts did not succeed as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The "Kurds turned out to be stubborn," or rather, the Turkish state's "fascist dynamism" of the 1920s and early 1930s loosened, preventing the full execution of the assimilation project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

The administration ultimately withdrew from active assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A significant migration occurred from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, as the "Turkish upper class" abandoned the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This withdrawal inadvertently led to the preservation of Kurdish identity, as "Kurdishness was given as a gift, it was left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## International Parallels

Similar patterns of attempting to establish artificial histories and [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | ethnic identities]] are observed in other countries in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The "stupidity and immorality" of these minority policies and the invention of "artificial histories" are comparable across these nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

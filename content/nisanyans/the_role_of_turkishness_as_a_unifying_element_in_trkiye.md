From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of "Turkishness" has been a central and evolving element intended to unify citizenship in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This discourse has undergone significant transformations, particularly between the early years of the Republic and the 1930s.

## Early Republic: A Broad Definition (1923-1932)

The foundations of the Republic, laid in 1923, were built with the hope that Turkishness would serve as a unifying factor in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. During the 1920s, up until 1932, the official state discourse did not include the [[central_asian_theory_and_its_influence_on_turkish_identity | Central Asian theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

During this period, the definition of a Turk was inclusive:
> "I do not know the Turkish language, Turkish culture, Turkish, or anyone who adopts the Turkish national ideal is Turkish." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

This implicitly meant that non-Muslims were considered Turkish regardless of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Radical Ideological Shift (Post-1930s)

A radical and sudden change occurred in Turkish ideology from 1932-1933 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. By the winter of 1932-1933, a new historical narrative began to emerge, suggesting a "racist theory" that Turks originated from Central Asia and were the founders of all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This became the official ideology from 1933, notably adopted at the 1st Turkish Language Congress and 1st Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift

Three potential reasons are considered for this ideological shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:

#### 1. Winds Blowing from Europe
In 1933, Hitler's rise to power in Germany dramatically altered global political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Türkiye, which had previously considered models like the Soviet and, more importantly, the Mussolini model in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, began to respond to new trends. The Mussolini model emphasized a single will and leader dominating society to achieve reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. From 1933 onwards, [[racism_and_nationalism_in_turkey | racism]] gained ground in Europe, with the "wave of the future" seen as the Nazis and an idea of "purity" dominating world discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Türkiye quickly adopted these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This illustrates the [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | impact of European political changes on Turkish identity discourse]].

#### 2. Resurgence of Old Cadres
The [[central_asian_theory_and_its_influence_on_turkish_identity | Central Asian theory]], which posited Turks' origins in Central Asia, was popular among imported Progress cadres, particularly those from the Turkish Hearth, in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This theory was suppressed after 1922-1923, during the War of Independence and the early Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Notably, Ziya Gökalp's theory was silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, from 1932 onwards, these previously silenced cadres re-emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, suggesting a shift in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

#### 3. Inadequacy of the Republic's Founding Ideology
The third reason suggests that the Republic's initial founding ideology was perceived as insufficient to politically unify the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. It was considered not "tasty" or "peppery" enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This ideology only resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments, failing to find widespread support in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Around 1930-1931, the regime experienced turmoil, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a return to Turkism, specifically a statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian ideology, would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The racist Turkist ideology introduced in the 1930s is distinct from the Republic's initial founding ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Assimilation Policies and Their Failure

The shift in ideology aimed at assimilation, with the hope of crushing or assimilating groups like the Kurds within one or two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. However, these calculations did not succeed because the Kurds "turned out to be stubborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The Turkish state and the republican regime, which had a strong "fascist dynamism" in the 1920s and early 1930s, later "loosened its muscles" and could not carry out the assimilation project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

A significant outcome was a large migration from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The Turkish upper classes initially sent their children to schools in Istanbul and Ankara, eventually moving away from the region themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This inadvertently contributed to the preservation of "Kurdishness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## International Parallels

Türkiye's experience with defining national identity and minority policies is not unique. Countries in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia, exhibit similar "stupidity and immorality" in their minority policies and attempts to invent artificial histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The "somersaults" these countries perform to create their national narratives are striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

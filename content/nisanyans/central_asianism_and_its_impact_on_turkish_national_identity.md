The concept of [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]] as a unifying element of citizenship in Türkiye underwent a significant transformation, particularly from the 1930s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This shift involved the rise of "Central Asianism," a theory positing the Central Asian origins of Turks and their role in founding world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Early Republican Definition of Turkishness (1923-1932)

In the initial years of the Republic, founded in 1923, the aspiration was for [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]] to serve as a unifying national element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. During this period, specifically until 1932, the "Central Asian theory" was neither taught nor acknowledged in official state publications or by Atatürk's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The prevailing definition of "Turkish" was inclusive: anyone who adopted the Turkish language, culture, or national ideal was considered Turkish, regardless of their origin, implicitly including non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This was the dominant ideology of the Republic's formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Radical Shift to Central Asianism (After 1930)

A radical and swift change occurred after 1930, particularly from 1932-1933 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In the winter of 1932-33, the "Great President" (Atatürk) began writing a history book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This new historical narrative incorporated a racist theory suggesting that Turks originated from Central Asia and were responsible for founding all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. From 1933, this "Central Asian" narrative became the official state ideology, formally adopted at the First Turkish Language Congress and First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Reasons for the Ideological Shift

Three primary reasons are considered for this radical ideological shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:

### 1. European Influence

*   **Rise of Nazism:** Hitler's ascent to power in Germany in 1933 profoundly altered global political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Totalitarian Models:** In 1923, Türkiye considered two models: the Soviet and, more significantly, the Mussolini model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The Mussolini model emphasized societal unity under a single leader's will to achieve major reforms, summarized as "Italianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Racism and Purity:** From 1933, racism gained momentum in Europe, with Nazism perceived as "the wave of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The idea of "purity" began to dominate global discourse, and Türkiye quickly adopted these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### 2. Resurgence of Old Cadres

*   **Suppressed Turkism:** The Central Asianism thesis was popular among Union and Progress cadres, particularly the Turkish Hearth members, in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, it was suppressed after 1922-23 during the War of Independence and the Republic's founding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, when Union and Progress's Turkism (like Ziya Gökalp's theory) was silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Re-emergence:** From 1932 onwards, these previously silenced cadres suddenly re-emerged, suggesting a shift in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 3. Inadequacy of Founding Ideology

*   **Political Instability:** The Republic's initial founding ideology was deemed insufficient to politically unify the country, lacking convincing power or broad societal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It primarily resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, failing to connect with wider society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Regime Turmoil:** In 1930-31, the regime faced turmoil, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Leaders concluded that a return to Turkism would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Consequences of Central Asianism and Assimilation Efforts

The shift to a racist, statist, leaderist, and totalitarian ideology in the 1930s marked a departure from the Republic's initial founding ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This new approach aimed at assimilating various groups, particularly the Kurds, with the expectation of either "crushing" them in one generation or assimilating them in two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

However, these calculations did not account for the resilience of groups like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, who proved "stubborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The Turkish state, despite its initial "fascist dynamism" in the 1920s and early 1930s, eventually "loosened its muscles" and failed to fully execute the assimilation project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This period also saw a significant migration from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, with the "Turkish classes" and upper class moving out of the eastern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This demographic shift, where Kurdishness was "given as a gift" or "left" to the Kurds, contributed to the inability to achieve full assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Regional Parallels

The struggles with [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_turkey | national identity]] and minority policies seen in Türkiye are not unique. Other countries in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia, exhibit similar challenges with their minority policies and often engage in "somersaults" to invent artificial histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This commonality highlights broader regional issues concerning the [[examination_of_ethnic_and_cultural_identity_in_turkey | examination of ethnic and cultural identity]] and the construction of [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | historical narratives]].

The richness and expressive power of a language are complex topics that go beyond simple vocabulary size or grammatical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.

## Grammar and Basic Structures
The basic structures of languages, including syntax and morphology (word derivation systems), are generally considered competent to fulfill all functions allowed by human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>. Grammar is seen as a lower layer of language, deriving from the structure of human intelligence and the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. Differences in language richness or poverty are not attributed to sentence structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. For basic human problems and expressions, one can communicate as perfectly in Turkish as in any other language, including Bengali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.

## Beyond Vocabulary: The Role of Expression
The richness of a language extends beyond its vocabulary to include "expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43">[01:25:43]</a>. This broader concept encompasses:
*   **Concepts and Patterns** Various patterns used to express complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:53">[01:25:53]</a>.
*   [[The role of proverbs and idioms in language | Idioms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.
*   **Argument Patterns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

A language that has produced a large volume of sophisticated written material over generations accumulates more tools to express complex, new, and unfamiliar concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

## Impact of Written Texts
There is a direct correlation between the volume of written texts published in a language and the breadth, richness, and depth of its expressive spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>. More written texts lead to more complex and rich expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. Each text read contributes to a society's common repertoire of expressions and helps in learning language skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>.

## Language Tradition and Processing
When moving to higher levels of expression, such as writing philosophy or other specialized fields, the language's tradition and how it has been processed make a significant difference, not merely its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>. Translating complex philosophical works into a language without a developed tradition in that specific area can be challenging, akin to "acrobatics" or a "circus show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. This is because the necessary tools and tradition for expressing such intricate concepts are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.

Besim Tibuk stated that [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurds]] should confront the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The "Armenian incident" is understood not merely as the events of 1915, but as the culmination of a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse, with 1915 serving as the "finishing move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Historical Context of Kurdish-Armenian Relations

Prior to 1915, the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish element]] was considered the "real tyrant" for [[language_and_cultural_changes_among_ottoman_armenians | Armenians]], causing them to flee their homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Kurdish tribal leaders and later, Kurdish sect sheikhs, were described as experts in killing [[language_and_cultural_changes_among_ottoman_armenians | Armenians]], seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For a long period, until the last quarter of the 19th century, [[language_and_cultural_changes_among_ottoman_armenians | Armenians]] consistently viewed [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Turks]], specifically the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman State]], as their allies and protectors against the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It was typical for [[language_and_cultural_changes_among_ottoman_armenians | Armenians]] to seek refuge and assistance from the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians and_kurds | Ottoman governor]] against attacks by Kurdish aghas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Kurdish Involvement in the 1915 Annihilation Project

The 1915 events were a conscious and cold-blooded annihilation project initiated by the Union and Progress administration of the Turkish state and the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman state bureaucracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Their objective was to eliminate the "Armenian problem" that had persisted for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The Turkish state used Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish populace as allies, helpers, and subcontractors in this effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This was facilitated by an existing tradition of massacre and extortion among the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, which the Turkish state successfully exploited in the Eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The state essentially gave implicit permission to the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]], reassuring them that the state would support their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Shifting Kurdish Perspective

Recent studies indicate a significant shift in the Kurdish stance. There was a notable hostility towards the Armenian Church around 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, after the systematic looting and usurpation of property, goods, and women ceased, the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] "came to their senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This realization led them to understand that they were now "face to face with the Turkish state" and risked destruction themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Over the last 20 to 30 years, the attitude and approach of the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] towards the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian issue]] has undergone a radical and appreciable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This positive development suggests that [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey_and_armenia | Turks]] could benefit from overcoming their own prejudices and ignorance, similar to the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish]] transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Türkiye's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict is described as "extremely complicated and extremely versatile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This involves a **bilingual and double-layered policy** concerning [[middle_east_geopolitical_tensions_involving_israel_and_trkiye | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This dual approach is not unique to Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Public Diplomacy vs. Covert Relations

On one hand, Türkiye adopts a seemingly "tough and uncompromising attitude" in public diplomacy with [[middle_east_geopolitical_tensions_involving_israel_and_trkiye | Israel]], aiming to appear sympathetic to the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This includes actions such as declaring national mourning for the murder of Hamas leader Hani and banning Instagram, citing this as justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

However, concurrently, Türkiye subtly continues its relations with [[middle_east_geopolitical_tensions_involving_israel_and_trkiye | Israel]] and appears to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Economic Dimension of the Dual Policy

An example of this duality surfaced in a news report indicating that while Türkiye had banned various goods shipments and trade with [[middle_east_geopolitical_tensions_involving_israel_and_trkiye | Israel]] for two months, its trade volume with a country identified as Palestine increased by 1000 times during a three-month period compared to the same period last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This trade included large-scale exports of cement, jewelry, luxury goods, and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Internal Disagreements

It is suggested that not all decision-making authorities within Türkiye hold the same opinion or act with a unified voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:28]</a>. There might be a conflict, disagreement, or clash, with the president potentially holding a different view on the issue compared to the cadres responsible for Türkiye's [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:47]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Divine commands, especially within the Abrahamic traditions, emphasize an unquestioning faith and obedience that often transcends rational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This concept suggests that if God has commanded something, it must be submitted to without question, even if it goes against basic morality or conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Unquestioning Faith

A key example of this absolute obedience is seen in the story of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his own son because God commanded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This act is presented as an ideal of faith, where belief is maintained "unconditionally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and without argument, even if it seems impossible or contrary to reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This type of faith is described as "to trust in the heart of something that the mind cannot hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. It requires believing in events that defy natural laws, such as a virgin birth or resurrection after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Such faith is not a decree but a drawing, an unconditional belief that leads to salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Complexity of Religious Law

The Jewish religion, for instance, is characterized by an "extraordinarily complicated series" of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These rules, such as dietary restrictions (e.g., not mixing milk and meat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> or specific ritualistic requirements (e.g., specific number of wine bottles at the table) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, often lack a "logical reason" for their observance beyond the fact that "God commanded" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The adherence to these "incomprehensible" rules is based solely on God's "inaccessibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Evolution of Religious Authority

Historically, societies relied on the authority of their ancestors for knowledge and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. However, as religions developed, particularly around 2000-2500 years ago, there was a shift towards attributing religious hypotheses directly to God's intervention, rather than merely ancestral transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. This elevation meant that divine commands became "indisputable" and "absolute," even if they appeared irrational, because they were perceived as coming from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. Unlike ancestral sayings, which could be debated or contradicted, God's word was beyond argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. This established a foundation for [[Religious Texts and Interpretations | written religious sources]] to be seen as definitive, requiring belief even if they seemed contradictory or lacked external verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.

## The Torah and its Composition

The Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, is presented as a foundational text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. These books include:
*   **Genesis**: The book of creation, containing stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Exodus**: Narrates the liberation of Israelites from Egypt, Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, and the Israelites' journey in the desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Leviticus**, **Numbers**, and **Deuteronomy**: Primarily consist of laws and regulations related to sacrifice, purity, and social conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. These sections often contain detailed instructions for daily life and rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

Later books, such as the Prophet Books (e.g., Judges, Samuel, Kings) and Writings (e.g., Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Lamentations, Daniel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>, continue the narrative and introduce wisdom literature and prophetic messages.

However, modern scholarly study, particularly since the 18th century, has critically examined the composition of these texts. The **Documentary Hypothesis** posits that the Torah is a compilation of different sources written by various authors over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. For example, the Book of Genesis contains two separate creation stories with contradictions, indicating different narrative traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. Similarly, different linguistic styles and theological concerns within the text suggest distinct authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

These critical analyses also reveal that certain parts of the text might have been edited or removed to omit stories of "other gods" or create gaps in the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. The struggle against the worship of other deities by Israelite prophets is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.

## Archaeological and Historical Reassessment

Archaeological findings in the Levant have also challenged traditional historical narratives presented in the biblical texts, particularly regarding the size and significance of early Israelite kingdoms. For instance, Jerusalem during the time of David and Solomon (around 1000 BCE) was likely a small shepherd settlement of approximately 30 neighborhoods, rather than the vast, powerful kingdom described in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Its population was roughly 5,000 around 700 BCE, expanding later to 25,000 after the collapse of the Northern Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

These findings suggest that a complex, urbanized society with a sophisticated royal order capable of producing extensive written epics did not exist in Judah during the purported time of David and Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. The detailed narratives and laws are seen as products of a later period, perhaps around 600 BCE, reflecting the concerns of the time, such as establishing a strong identity for the Jewish state in contrast to the northern Kingdom of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. The biblical narrative appears to exalt Jerusalem and its heroes while often portraying the northern kingdom negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.

This critical approach to [[Religious Texts and Interpretations | religious texts]] and [[historical_narratives_and_philosophical_discussions_on_religious_events | historical narratives]] has led to the understanding that much of what is presented as historical fact was, in part, a "mythology" created for political and identity-forming purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>, particularly within the political context of the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. These scholarly efforts, often led by German researchers, involved analyzing ancient languages like Aramaic and Greek to trace the origins and development of the texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.

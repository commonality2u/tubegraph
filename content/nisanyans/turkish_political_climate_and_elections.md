## Overview of Recent Elections and Political Mood
The speaker's program last week coincided with the publication of election results, which did not turn out as predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. Despite personal predictions, the speaker expressed happiness with the election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, noting that many AKP supporters in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] were also pleased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This sentiment stems from a prolonged period of "oppressive arrogance and insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> and a government described as "sometimes cruel and does not recognize law" or justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The management style of the current government has reached "an unbearable point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, characterized by arrogance, insolence, and a "constantly spraying" ideology of hatred that disregards the rights of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Such a government, when exhibiting these qualities, "gets a heavy slap from the voters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The recent election outcome was deemed both an "unexpected event" and a "pleasing event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Looking ahead, the speaker refrains from predicting the results in three years, emphasizing that "3 years is a very long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Early elections are considered "not possible at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a> as the ruling party has not lost its parliamentary majority, there's no widespread national revolt, no expectation of war, and no possibility of coalition with the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Thus, the [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | status quo]] is likely to persist for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

## Challenges to the Democratic System in [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Türkiye]]
The speaker has long argued that the "end of the democratic period in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] has come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The current government has concentrated bureaucratic, legal, and military power in its hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Democratic openings are not allowed, leading to elections that are "shaped either pleasantly or otherwise in line with the preferences of the current ruling coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

The democratic system, traditionally seen as an absolute value in the Western world since the 19th century and in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] since the mid-20th century, "does not work anymore in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] as well as all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The core assumptions that made democracy attractive have vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Key missing elements include:
*   A "common value system that the society will accept as a reference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
*   A class of "wise people" (intellectuals, educated, elders) who defend this common value system above personal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

Without these, "it is very difficult and impossible to keep democratic struggle under control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Impossibility of Fair Competition
Governments elected by democratic votes lack "any real value in a sociology where armed and unarmed bureaucracy has grown and become so powerful" and dominates unorganized sections of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. State power held by political cadres is integrated with bureaucracy, financial resources, and armed forces (including police and intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:02]</a>.

> "Under these conditions, I think there is no chance and possibility of a fair competition between a party in power and a party or parties out of power." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>

The legal system no longer serves as a neutral referee; instead, "when the referee blows the whistle, the players go and beat the referee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. In this new "game," one team controls the goalposts, plays with more players, and can "buy whomever it wants from the other team's 11 players or throw whomever it wants off the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. The "rules of the game have changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, and all conditions for a dictatorial government have been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

## [[turkeys_political_landscape_after_recent_elections | Political Landscape and Regime Type]]
[[Political situation in Trkiye | Türkiye]] has established an "authoritarian monarchy" regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>. This type of regime, characterized by a prominent leader and power concentrated in a pyramid towards that leader, is seen in countries like China, Russia, Hungary, India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. While the quality of the leader and strength of the pyramid vary (e.g., strong in China, perhaps less so in [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Türkiye]]), the term "authoritarian monarchy" effectively describes them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

In contrast, European Union and North American countries are examples of systems where real authority lies with an "authoritarian administration" and "administrative staff" in the background, with public figures serving as "puppets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a>.

For "thinking people," the main questions regarding an authoritarian monarchy are:
1.  How can it function "in a less harmful, more positive and more effective way"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:59:00">[25:59:00]</a>
2.  How can an authoritarian monarchy be "overthrown," for those with a radical perspective? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>

## Constitutional Analysis: The 1961 Constitution
The 1961 Constitution is described as both "libertarian" and "antidemocratic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Its primary goal was to "prevent the emergence of a mass movement, a mass choice, a political alternative that can challenge the Kemalist state idea of [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], the state and the dominance of the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. It was specifically prepared "against the Democrat Party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.

Measures implemented to achieve this anti-democratic aim included:
*   **Proportional representation system**: This made it "impossible to form a majority in the parliament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>, leading to governments not directly elected by the people but formed through behind-the-scenes negotiations among the ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.
*   **Establishment of the Constitutional Court**: This created a "high-level tutelage regime" alongside the Court of Cassation and Council of State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **National Security Council (NSC)**: This established a "military government above the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>, which effectively ruled [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] for 30 years with the United States' CIA as its "real guide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

While the Constitution incorporated common Western values like basic human rights, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>, these "remained largely at the level of words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>, as they did not impact the real balance of power defined by the proportional system, Constitutional Court, and NSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. The libertarian aspects were gradually "castrated and destroyed" after the March 12, 1971 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Demographics and the Role of Kurds in [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkish Politics]]
A significant demographic reality in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is that the only sector with a rapidly increasing population (excluding Syrians and Afghans) is the Kurdish population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. The Turkish population is aging rapidly, with an average age exceeding 30 and a low fertility rate (1.5-1.6 births per parent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. In contrast, the Kurdish population is young and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. This demographic shift means that Kurds "will play an important role one way or another and will continue to play an increasing role" in [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. It is up to them whether they pursue this role through separate parties or by integrating into the existing political order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

## Foreign Policy Over Domestic Politics
The speaker believes that [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Türkiye]]'s position in foreign policy is of "vital importance rather than its fruitless conflicts in domestic politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. Domestic political issues and economic challenges are less critical in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

As a NATO alliance member, [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] has "no chance of moving too far away from the American front" and lacks significant independence in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>. The crucial question for [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is "which side [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] will be on when a big war breaks out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>, and current policies are shaped by this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. For the last 15-20 years, especially after the collapse of the Syrian "terrace," [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] has been trying to follow a more independent and distant line within the Western alliance to minimize harm from external conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. This strategy is likely more the work of [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s "deep state" than Mr. Erdoğan's personal preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. Consequently, "not much will change" in foreign policy regardless of which government is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>, as any government finds it difficult to deviate from the main lines determined by the deep state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>.

## The Evolution of the "Nation" Concept in [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Türkiye]]
The word "nation" (millet) is originally Arabic, meaning "religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:16">[02:27:16]</a>. In Ottoman dictionaries and usage for centuries before the Republic, "nation" was equivalent to "religion and sharia" (religious law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. It signifies the "path followed in terms of belief and worship and deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:8:21">[02:8:21]</a>. In the Quran, "nation" is consistently translated as "religion" in standard Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:8:32">[02:8:32]</a>. The speaker suggests its exact Turkish equivalent should be "Torah," representing the "whole of the traditions, rules, beliefs, and narratives that define a nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:9:24">[02:9:24]</a>.

By 1876, the starting point of modernism in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], definitions began to shift. Ahmet Vefik Pasha's dictionary still defined "nation" as "religion and sect," differentiating it from "ummet" (tribe and congregation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:47">[03:17:47]</a>. However, by 1900, Şemseddin Sami noted the inadvertent use of "nation" instead of "ummet" and vice-versa, citing "Islamic nations" and "Turkish nation" as wrong expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:10">[03:30:10]</a>.

In 1924, Mehmet Baha Bey's dictionary presented a starkly different, modern definition: "A nation is a community of people who live on the same land, of common origin and language, or have been living in the same country for a long time, who are under the administration of the same government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that "all of the factors he listed are wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>:
*   **Territorial unity**: Invalid, as seen in nations like the Jewish, Armenian, or Turkish populations spread across different lands (e.g., Greeks in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]], Turks in Greece/Iraq) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:26">[03:52:26]</a>.
*   **Common origin**: Physically impossible for any nation, as populations have mixed throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Common language**: Invalid, as shown by multilingual nations like the Swiss or Ethiopians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:31">[03:36:31]</a>.
*   **Common interests**: Invalid, as many groups classified as nations historically lacked common interests (e.g., Czechs and Slovaks, Azeris, Ukrainians, Kurds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:15">[03:37:15]</a>.
*   **Under the same government**: Invalid, as seen with Koreans or Kurds, who are part of a nation but live under different governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:10">[03:38:10]</a>.

The modern concept of "nation" simply means "the citizens of a state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This new concept emerged with compulsory military service after the French Revolution, defining a nation as all those under the state's command, holding its identity card, and owing it service and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:45">[04:40:45]</a>. Ideologically, however, the narrative is reversed: "first the nation and then the state," implying that people formed a nation first and then established a state to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:33">[04:41:33]</a>. This ideological construct faces the challenge of defining "nation" logically without relying on the state's bureaucratic definition (e.g., "population registry gives you that paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:43">[04:42:43]</a>).

The "nation that founded the Republic of [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] was systematically created and packaged between 1915 and 1925" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:50">[04:39:50]</a>. During this period:
*   Hundreds of thousands of Turkish-speaking Christians and Jews were excluded and deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:09">[04:40:09]</a>.
*   Non-Turkish speakers like Albanians, Cretans, Circassians, and Kurds were included, demonstrating that language was not the defining criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:17">[04:41:17]</a>.

The speaker's family has been from Istanbul for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Their experiences shed light on the [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history and relations]] within the city, particularly during periods of significant upheaval.

## Deportation Period (1915)

During the Deportation period, mass deportation was not generally implemented in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, a "famous incident" occurred on April 24, 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, marking the first move of deportation in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Arrests and Exiles
Approximately 150-200 to 30-40 people were arrested and sent to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The vast majority of these individuals, all but three or five, were never heard from again and were presumed killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The speaker's great-uncle, a writer and publishing house owner, was part of Istanbul's cultural and intellectual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He was among 24 people arrested during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After being held for a while, he was released, though the reasons remain unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. One individual who was exiled at that time hid in the speaker's grandfather's house for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Continuity and Migration (1922)

Despite the events of 1915, the speaker's family "somehow continued their existence in Istanbul" by 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Publishing House
The speaker's grandfather owned a publishing house that focused on publishing translations of famous modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Mass Migration to France
Following the fall of Izmir to the Turks in 1922, panic spread in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This led to France allowing, for the first time, the mass migration of Armenians from Istanbul to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This opportunity for mass migration did not exist in 1915 but emerged in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Many Armenians from Istanbul, including the speaker's family, packed into ships and left in great panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Return to Istanbul
After two to three years in Paris, the speaker's grandfather returned to Türkiye (Turkey) because there was no one to revive his old publishing house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He reopened bookstores and second-hand bookseller shops near Beyazıt Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These shops became "one of the most well-known, most beloved and most key books of Istanbul" until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Education and Cultural Shifts

### School Closures
In 1915, all [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian schools in Istanbul]] were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The speaker's grandmother, who was fifteen and in middle school at the time, had to find alternative education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. She attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, which enabled her to learn French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian schools]] were eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The [[history_of_alevism | Alevi movement]] in Anatolia took shape as a great social explosion and a revolutionary movement in the last days of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century, specifically from the 1490s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:19">[01:40:19]</a>. This movement is described as an uprising against the religion of Islam imposed by the central administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>.

## Historical Origins and Spread
The movement broke out simultaneously across the geography of present-day Turkey, Syria, Northern Iraq, and the Western part of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>. It was a political movement led by Shah Ismail, his father Cüneyt, and his grandfather Haydar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.

## Geographical Concentration and Suppression
The [[historical_origins_of_alevism | Alevi movement]] apparently had an effect in the Kurdish provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>. However, during the period of oppression that followed, it appears that the Kurdish region, specifically east of the Euphrates, was completely cleansed of Alevism, with its roots dried up and only those who escaped surviving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">[01:41:46]</a>.

In Türkiye, Kurdish Alevism is primarily concentrated in a single island-like area just west of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. This region includes Dersim, extending to the countryside of Malatya, and further to Adıyaman, forming a triangle-shaped area that became the homeland of Kurdish Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>. East of the Euphrates or east of Dersim, Alevism was largely eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:37">[01:42:37]</a>.

## Homogeneity and Relationship with Armenians
The [[differences_between_various_alevi_communities | Alevi movement]] is not homogeneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. As a movement that opposes and rejects authority, it is considered anarchic and multi-headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>. Examples of distinct units include:
*   Dersim Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:12">[01:43:12]</a>
*   Elbistan Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>
*   Akçadağ Malatya Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:19">[01:43:19]</a>
*   Maraş and Pazarcık region Kurdish Alevi culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:22">[01:43:22]</a>

All these geographies were former Armenian homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:36">[01:43:36]</a>. Therefore, Armenians have been assimilated into this movement in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. The relationship between the Armenian element and the Zaza or Kurdish Alevi element, especially in Dersim, has been extensively researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

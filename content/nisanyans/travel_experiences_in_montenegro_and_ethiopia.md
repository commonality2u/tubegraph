## Recent Travel to Montenegro

A group of 40-42 friends and acquaintances recently spent a week in [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The experience was described as a "really good time," involving eating, drinking, traveling, and talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For five days, the group focused on touring, dining, and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. They visited several places of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> and enjoyed good food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Evenings involved discussions on the future of the country and similar topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The trip left a "good taste" in the participants' mouths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Many of the participants were new acquaintances, but the group quickly formed strong bonds, becoming "like friends for 40 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This quick camaraderie, also observed in previous tours to Georgia and Armenia, significantly enhanced the travel experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The positive outcome prompted consideration for the next travel destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Upcoming Trip to Ethiopia

The idea for the next trip emerged from a friend named Onur, who owns a detergent factory in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The suggestion to visit Ethiopia was well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, and a trip is now planned for the first week of March, lasting approximately 14-15 days, or two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Regions of Ethiopia

Ethiopia, known by its old name, has two distinct tourism regions: the north and the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

#### Northern Ethiopia
Years ago, extensive [[cultural_and_historical_insights_into_ethiopia | travel experiences]] were undertaken in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This region is home to magnificent and ancient monasteries, representing an "original Christian culture," distinct from Western Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Visiting these sites, including staying in one for a few days, was a "great experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

However, current travel to the north is largely impossible due to road closures and an ongoing civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The war remains outside government control in many northern areas, necessitating air travel to accessible locations, which is deemed impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Geographically, northern Ethiopia and North Africa are seen as extensions of the Middle East, characterized by Mediterranean culture, historical states, empires, and a relatively dry climate, similar to regions in Turkey, Anatolia, Syria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

#### Southern Ethiopia
In contrast, the south is described as "Africa" â€“ a "fantastic country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It has been a "dream trip" since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This region, encompassing southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, is considered the "Africa of Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It is where some of Africa's oldest cultures have survived largely unspoiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The podcast host notes that understanding how to access this region was initially unclear but now seems feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. A significant portion of the African continent, particularly 45 out of 50 states, shares a common cultural integrity stemming from Bantu migrations around the 10th century Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Ethiopia Tour Announcement
An [[ethiopia_tour_announcement | Ethiopia tour]] will be officially announced very soon, likely within a week or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Details regarding prices and the application form will be made available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This [[upcoming_trip_to_ethiopia_and_broadcasting_challenges | upcoming trip to Ethiopia]] is presented as an exciting opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The architectural legacies of the Seljuk and Ottoman periods in Anatolia present distinct characteristics and cultural implications. Many of Turkey's current provincial and district centers were founded during the Seljuk and principality periods, and their present-day urban fabric largely reflects this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>. The most impressive surviving architectural works, including mosques, madrasahs, bridges, caravanserais, and hospitals, originate from the Seljuk period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.

## Seljuk and Principality Period Architecture

The Seljuk period, starting from the 1190s until around 1453, was a time of significant urbanization across Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. Cities and towns were established at key strategic points, often at the intersections of trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. This era saw the construction of striking buildings that functioned as both trade and cultural centers, characterized by their original and innovative designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. A notable feature of Seljuk and principality period mosques is their uniqueness; none are alike, with each exhibiting original architectural elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

## Ottoman Period Architecture

In contrast, the [[ottoman_architecture_and_its_modern_influence | Ottoman period]] left a more limited architectural heritage in the Anatolian countryside, with few significant structures outside of the three imperial capitals: Edirne, Bursa, and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. Following the Ottoman conquest, mosques were built in every town and city, but these were typically standardized, dome-shaped structures derived from "template architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>. This uniformity contrasts sharply with the originality of the Seljuk period.

## Influences and Cultural Synthesis

The [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | architectural traditions]] in Anatolia, particularly from the 12th century onwards, clearly draw from the civilizations that preceded them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>. [[islamic_architecture_and_cultural_hegemony | Turkish Islamic architecture]] east of the Euphrates is considered a continuation of Armenian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>, while west of the Euphrates, it continues Byzantine architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

A particularly significant example of this synthesis is seen in places like Ahlat. From the 1100s, a new Islamic synthesis was created upon the foundations of old Armenian architectural traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>. This involved taking the technical mastery and forms of Armenian architecture and reinterpreting them with a new spirit, style, and ideological meaning to create a new Islamic architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. Examples include the Ahlat tombs, Tercan Mamahatun tombs, Erzurum tombs, and structures like the DivriÄŸi Mosque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.

This process of cultural blending challenges simplistic notions of conquest and replacement, suggesting instead a new civilizational vision and ideological formation emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>. The origins of the architects (e.g., whether Armenian) are less relevant than the process of reinterpretation and the creation of a new, distinct identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>. The previously existing ideological structure and customs were re-shaped by a new state, architecture, symbolism, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. Examining this, especially in the context of Ahlat's architectural [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | history]], offers an insightful perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

Language plays a crucial role in shaping and reflecting national identity, undergoing transformations influenced by historical interactions, modernization, and societal perceptions.

## Language and Modernization in Türkiye

Türkiye's adaptation to the modern world, particularly from the 1810s to the 1960s, saw French emerge as a primary [[Significance of traditional and modern alphabets for cultural identity | reference language]] for Turks when acquiring new concepts from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>. This influence led to the adoption of approximately 4800 French words into the standard Turkish vocabulary from an estimated treasury of 15,000 words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

### Integration of French Vocabulary

The influx of French words brought with it new cultural phenomena and institutional changes. Examples of words adopted include:
*   **Cultural innovations**: "Gazeta" (newspaper), "musician," "lotarya" (lottery), "sofa," "billiards," "coat," "tie," "cigarette," and "ticket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.
*   **Technical and scientific advancements**: "Steamship," "railway," "telegraph," "electricity," "thermometer," and "barometer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Commercial products**: "Calico" and "flannel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Institutional concepts**: "Bank," "parliament," "commander," "policy," "dictator," "police," "gendarmerie," and "budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>.

These terms often introduced concepts previously non-existent or unfamiliar in Ottoman society, such as the idea of a "ticket" for public organized entertainment or transport, reflecting a shift towards modern social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:55">[03:02:55]</a>. The adoption of "policy" as a respectable discipline, moving beyond previous understandings of "intrigue" or "infidel game," illustrates the Ottoman Empire's aspiration to join the European community of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:03">[03:39:03]</a>.

In contrast, Turkish words entering French are much older, dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries, such as "sorbet" and "cafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:09">[03:27:09]</a>. After the 1960s, and especially post-1983, English supplanted French as Türkiye's primary reference language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

## Debates on Turkish Language and Identity

Discussions around dictionaries, such as the Kube Altı dictionary, reveal different perspectives on what constitutes "ideal Turkish." Some view an "idealized" and "frozen Turkish" from the 1950s-1960s as a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:50">[04:01:50]</a>. This period, known for its strong press and literary tradition, is often seen as a cultural peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:52">[04:08:52]</a>. However, language is a dynamic entity that develops and changes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:14">[04:27:14]</a>.

A broad definition of Turkish language emphasizes its fluid nature:
> "Every word that people who think they are speaking Turkish to someone in any sentence will use in any conversation is Turkish. The original may be English, it may be Chinese, it may be made up, it may be wrong. When I say this, you are loading meaning on it. If the person in front of me understands my meaning, it is Turkish. That's it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:52">[04:39:52]</a>

This inclusive view suggests that identity is not tied to a static, pure form of language, but rather to its living, evolving usage by its speakers.

## Jadidism and Central Asian Turkic Identity

The [[Central Asianism and its impact on Turkish national identity | Jadidism movement]], emerging among Russian Muslims and Turks in Central Asia (led by Tatars and Bashkirs), was a significant innovation movement from the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. Spearheaded by figures like Ismail Gasprinski, it sought to adapt to the modern world through education and reform programs within Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>. The movement published magazines and newspapers and aimed for Turks and Muslims to integrate with modernity while operating within the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. After the failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution, many Jadid intellectuals migrated to Europe, Türkiye, and Iran, influencing revolutionary movements there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

## Language and National Consciousness in the Balkans

Before gaining independence, many Balkan nations under Ottoman rule, such as Serbs, Bulgarians, and Macedonians, did not have a widespread tradition of written language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>. The clergy, primarily Greeks, wrote in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. A "Slavic renaissance" occurred in the 1820s-1830s, as these groups discovered their languages could be written, leading to the creation of both religious and secular works and ultimately paving the way for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.

*   **Croatians**: Not under Ottoman rule, Croatians wrote in Italian, German, Hungarian, and Latin, integrating into those cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>.
*   **Bosnians**: Primarily wrote in Turkish using Ottoman script, and sometimes in Serbian with Ottoman script, due to their adoption of Muslim culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>.
*   **Albanians**: The idea of Albanian as a written language only emerged in the 1870s, with a shift from earlier marginal texts to the adoption of the Latin alphabet around 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>.

## Armenian Language and its Foundational Role

The Armenian alphabet, invented in 405 AD by Mesrop Maşot, is unique for being a deliberately created system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>. Maşot not only created the alphabet but also established a team of 12-13 educated young people to translate the Bible and Greek Christian classics into Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:34">[01:55:34]</a>. This monumental effort led to the creation of a significant Armenian literature and established the Armenian nation as one "known for its inclination towards writing, unlike neighboring nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:49">[01:55:49]</a>. Before this, the aristocracy primarily used Persian for written decrees and meetings, while the religious institution leaned towards Greek and Syriac cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>. This foundational act of creating a written language became a cornerstone of Armenian national identity.

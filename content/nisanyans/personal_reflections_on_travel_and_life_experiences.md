## Introduction

The speaker shares various personal reflections stemming from [[travel_experiences_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | travel experiences]], observations on society, politics, and human nature. These reflections cover topics from the religious landscape of Albania to the evolution of political ideologies and personal growth through adversity.

## Travel Experiences in Albania

The speaker recently visited Albania for a few days for official business, describing it as a neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This was their third visit in a year and a half, leading to a growing fondness for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

Initially, the speaker was prejudiced against Tirana, having heard it was a "bad city" with a gloomy atmosphere from its communist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. However, this perception was dispelled; Tirana is described as a "very big, complex, multi-dimensional, crowded city," a metropolis with modern and rich neighborhoods, a colorful bazaar, and an incredible abundance of cafes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Religious Diversity in Albania

Unlike surrounding countries like North Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro, where Albanians are predominantly Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, Albania is a nation "divided into religions and sects in a way that can be called insoluble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Slightly more than half of the population is Muslim, but this includes Sunni Muslims in the north and Bektashi Muslims in the south, which are considered "two separate religions" in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Additionally, there is a significant Orthodox Christian population, particularly in Southern Albania, influenced by Greek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

In Albania, religious distinction has largely "ceased to be the main and determining element of identity" or perhaps "has never been like that," a situation unparalleled in the Balkans, Anatolia, Middle East, or Caucasus where religion is typically the fundamental identity factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Mixed marriages are "extremely common," and cemeteries often have Christians and Muslims buried side by side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

This unique social cohesion is largely attributed to the Enver Hoxha regime (1944-1980s), which, from the 1960s onwards, banned all religions, closed places of worship, and declared atheism as the state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Before Hoxha, during the pre-World War II Kingdom period, there was already a strong secularism policy aimed at creating a single Albanian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. For about 100 years, there has been a serious effort to overcome religious differences and forge a common national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

### Melami Tekkesi: A Bektashi Lodge

A highlight of the trip was a visit to a Bektashi lodge called Melani Tekkesi, located in very southern Albania, close to the Greek border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. This lodge is difficult to reach, not mentioned in tourist sources, and requires travel on very bad, dirt roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

The speaker explored the concept of "Melamilik" or "Melamet," a movement of thought that emerged in Islamic history around the 12th or 13th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. It is described as a "terrible radicalism," a moral theory that puts "dynamite at the bottom of all moral theories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. The core idea of Melamet is that "virtue is almost always two-faced," and acting virtuous or talking about one's own virtue is an act to humiliate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. To reach true virtue, one "must be condemned," "blamed," "humiliated," and even "commit a crime" to break one's ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Life and Society

### The Changing Nature of Socialism

The speaker observes a common phenomenon: "everyone who was a Socialist in their 20s" often moves to the right later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Socialism is characterized as an "excitement," a feeling of "unlimited generosity," where personal interests are sacrificed for the good of society, especially the weak, poor, and oppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

However, as people mature and face social responsibilities, they encounter a "dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Being generous to others might mean "giving the sustenance of your closest relatives... to others," thereby victimizing one's own family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. To provide for those one is directly responsible for, one might have to be "selfish towards third parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

Additionally, with age, one begins to understand the "logic of some institutions, some structures, some habits and some values ​​in the society" better, realizing they "are not things that can be completely rejected" and are necessary for holding a society together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. These realizations, combined with decreasing energy levels, contribute to people becoming more conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>. Nevertheless, the speaker advises keeping the "Socialist Fire" of youth hidden "somewhere in a cell of your personality" rather than completely overcoming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

### Quality of Life and Population Density

The speaker discusses the relationship between population and quality of life, noting that in sparsely populated, isolated areas, quality of life can be low due to lack of labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. However, in today's world, the quality of life is "radically decreasing" with growing populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.

The speaker believes it's "not possible for a civilized person to live in cities with a population of 10-15-20 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. Modern life in such cities, with traffic, shantytowns, and monotonous geography, significantly detracts from the quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. It's suggested that either new forms of organization are needed for the 8 billion global population to live more efficiently and pleasantly, or the population should be "radically reduced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. The speaker estimates the "optimum point" for global population to be "approximately one billion people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

The speaker contrasts modern life with descriptions from a book written 100 years ago, where villages and towns were praised for delicious water, joyful vineyards and orchards, and communal festivities like walking to the mountains for kebabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. Such simple pleasures and a "feeling of living in a beautiful place" are seen as "canceled and destroyed" in today's social conditions and population densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear and Adversity

The speaker addresses the question of fearlessness, admitting to being afraid but having learned to overcome problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. A "feeling of overcoming every problem" is described as something that "comes from birth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. The speaker has faced "absolute danger of death 2-3 times" in life, reaching points where there seemed "no escape" from being killed or imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:17">[01:43:17]</a>. While these experiences were terrifying, they led to a feeling of "living for nothing," which is described as a "nice feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Expats and Travelers

For those wishing to leave Turkey without money or a globally valid profession, the speaker advises against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. Money or a recognized profession are essential for emigration; otherwise, it's better to try to build a new life within Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.

For those considering moving to a village in Turkey, the speaker suggests going with "at least 20 families," or a group of "like-minded people" of a certain age with children, for socialization and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. This collective approach helps overcome the tendency of locals to exclude outsiders and protects against "dirty tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>. Forming a community allows for shared responsibilities like hiring a teacher for children and engaging in local politics to build sewers, fountains, and roads, leading to a "real enjoyable, productive and constructive" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. This harks back to older traditions of establishing or taking over villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

Regarding [[travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_europe | travel advice]], particularly for [[travel_experiences_and_challenges_in_morocco_and_spain | penniless bicycle trips]] across Asia, the speaker emphasizes that what makes a trip "unforgettable and valuable" are the "difficulties you go through" and the "dangers you overcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>. True travel involves risks, such as getting lost in the Sahara, being attacked by guerrillas, or imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>. The pleasure comes from facing and overcoming these challenges, which helps a person grow and builds lifelong values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>.

For safe [[travel_experiences in Morocco | travel]], the speaker advises being brave, fearless, and unarmed when approaching people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. It's crucial to go with "hands open and your hands clean," as a friend, showing no fear, suspicion, or expectation of hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.

### Western Decline and Global Trends

The speaker acknowledges that living standards in the Western world are "still superior" and appreciates its cultural opportunities, pleasant villages, and well-mannered people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. However, the speaker maintains that the Western world is in a "radical decline," while the rest of the world is "rising quite impressively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. Western Europe is metaphorically described as a "nursing home that eats from capital," now primarily focused on "security and selfishness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>, having reduced life to simply securing doors and alarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:32">[01:36:32]</a>.

## Personal Conduct and Identity

### Dealing with Aggressive Parents

When asked for advice on dealing with an aggressive, critical, and rude father, the speaker acknowledges it as a "very, very difficult thing" and a "terrible thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:42">[01:36:42]</a>. Achieving emotional independence from such a parent is challenging. The advice given is to "constantly think if there is any truth in your father's criticisms," strive to be responsible and do what you do well, and "don't listen to the rest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>.

### Reflections on Personal Identity and Societal Roles

The speaker touches on [[reflections_on_personal_identity_and_societal_roles | reflections on personal identity and societal roles]], including observations on the changing dynamics of gender in politics and public discourse. While seeing feminism as a "perverted expression of class hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a> and women assuming a dominant role in public discourse as a "wrong event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:33">[01:25:33]</a>, the speaker expresses a deep affection for women, particularly young women, finding pleasure in their happiness and conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>. However, the speaker feels unable to adequately address them within the context of market conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

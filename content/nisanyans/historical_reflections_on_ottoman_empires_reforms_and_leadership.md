The period from 1861 to 1876, under Sultan Abdülaziz, witnessed an unparalleled [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | modernization and westernization]] movement in the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]], often referred to as the "glorious days of Tanzimat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a>.

## Abdülaziz's Reign and Modernization Efforts
During this 15-year period, the [[Ottoman Empire historical assessment | Ottoman Empire]] experienced significant shifts:
*   For the first time in [[Historical Account of the Ottoman Empire and its Legacy | Ottoman history]], non-Muslims were appointed as ministers, officers, and managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>.
*   Substantial advancements occurred in literature, painting, military and state organization, and the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>.
*   Under the leadership of Ali Pasha, Kececizade Fuat Pasha, and their associates, the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]] undertook a series of active reform efforts that overshadowed even the reforms of the Atatürk period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
*   Sultan Abdülaziz, described as old-fashioned and not deeply cultured but elegant and polite, initially allowed the Ali Pasha and Fuat Pasha teams to govern the country, especially in close cooperation with the French and British, for the first 10 years of his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.
*   However, in his last five years, after 1871, as state finances neared bankruptcy, he attempted to intervene in politics unsuccessfully, leading the country to the brink of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. He then retreated, allowing the old Tanzimat cadre to return to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>.

## The Armenian National Assembly as a Precursor to Constitutional Monarchy
Around 1861, a constitutional monarchy was attempted in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. The Armenian nation, a significant element of the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]], was granted a constitution and law by the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>. This led to the establishment of an elected Armenian National Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:34">[01:53:34]</a>.
*   Factions and parties quickly formed within this assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.
*   The administration of the Armenian nation was largely delegated to an administrative board formed by this assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:45">[01:53:45]</a>.
*   From the early 1870s, this board implemented radical and forward-looking measures, such as initiating statistics collection for Armenian society across the [[Historical Account of the Ottoman Empire and its Legacy | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>.
*   This parliament served as a "test bed" for the [[discussion_on_sociopolitical_context_and_the_concept_of_ottoman_commonwealth | Ottoman constitutional monarchy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>.
*   The significant economic, cultural, and educational breakthroughs achieved by Armenian society fostered a belief that a parliament would bring similar prosperity to the Muslim population of the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:25">[01:54:25]</a>.

## Abdülaziz's Downfall and Murat V's Brief Reign
When presented with the demand to declare a constitution and transition to a constitutional monarchy, Abdülaziz warned that such a move would cause the country to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. His refusal led to his overthrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:49">[01:51:49]</a>. He was subsequently found dead, a death widely believed to be a murder disguised as suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>.

Sultan Abdülaziz's nephew, Murat, was enthroned as Murat V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. The progressive cadres had high hopes for Murat V, who was described as:
*   Raised with an extremely modernist European mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.
*   A close friend of progressive figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.
*   A Freemason and even a master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:25">[01:52:25]</a>.

It was expected that Murat V would accelerate reforms and declare a constitutional monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>. However, immediately after Abdülaziz's overthrow, a loyal servant of Abdülaziz, Circassian Hasan, attacked a cabinet meeting, killing the Minister of War and other ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>. The head of the junta that overthrew Abdülaziz, Hüseyin Avni Pasha, was killed during this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:49">[01:55:49]</a>. Circassian Hasan was subsequently tried and executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>.

These events severely impacted Sultan Murat V, who reportedly suffered a mental breakdown and deep panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a>. His mental instability led him to refuse signing the constitutional reform. Consequently, three months later, a doctor's report declared him mentally unstable, and he was dethroned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

## Mithat Pasha and the Constitutional Monarchy Attempt under Abdulhamid II
Abdulhamid II, Murat V's brother, was then placed on the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:19">[01:57:19]</a>. Initially, Abdulhamid II resisted enacting the Constitutional Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a>. However, two to three months after his ascension, Mithat Pasha openly threatened to overthrow him and declare a Republic if he refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:34">[01:57:34]</a>.

Under this pressure, Abdulhamid II signed the Constitutional Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. Before signing, he added a crucial amendment known as the "111 articles," granting the Sultan the authority to exile anyone he wished, domestically or abroad, without a court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>. This amendment effectively undermined the constitutional monarchy's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. The new Constitutional Law remained in force for only about 13 months before Abdulhamid II shelved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>.

Mithat Pasha's fate was grim. After being forced to resign as grand vizier, he was exiled to the Governorship of Izmir, then recalled, and later exiled abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. Upon his return to Istanbul, a show trial known as the Yıldız Court was established, reminiscent of Stalin's, Atatürk's, or September 12 courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Mithat Pasha was sentenced to death for his role in the overthrow of Abdülaziz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. Although Sultan Abdulhamid II was known for not approving executions, Mithat Pasha's sentence was commuted to exile in a fortress in Taif, Arabia, where he and another Pasha were held in a dungeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

## Sustainability of the Ottoman Order
The [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman society]] before the 19th century featured a clear distinction between the ruling Muslim class and non-Muslims, who were effectively second-class citizens and "humiliated dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>. The question arises whether such an order can be sustained in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>.

The speaker notes that a country where the ruling class and lower class have different religious and affiliation bases, similar to the pre-19th-century [[Ottoman Empire historical assessment | Ottoman society]], faces an endless impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. This societal structure, characterized by a lack of emotional connection between the working class and national discourse (homeland, nation, flag, religion, martyrs), is deemed unsustainable in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

This historical context provides a critical lens for understanding the complexities and challenges faced by empires attempting [[comparison_of_ottoman_empires_collapse_with_other_empires | structural reforms]] and the [[impact_of_elite_policies_on_ottoman_society | consequences of elite policies]] on societal cohesion.

## The Ottoman Empire's Decline and European Power Shifts

### The Siege of Vienna (1683)
In 1683, the Ottoman Empire, which had been in a state of stagnation for over a century, was obsessed with conquering Vienna, a feat they had previously attempted in 1860 (likely a transcript error, should be 1529) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. Despite having lost its technological and economic superiority against European states, the Ottoman military leadership, such as Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa, believed they could achieve what Süleyman the Magnificent could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. The siege of Vienna lasted a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Unexpectedly, the Polish King Yan Sobieski arrived from the north with a cavalry army, said to be 100,000 strong, and inflicted a terrible defeat on the Turkish army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

### Consequences for the Ottoman Empire
The Ottoman Empire never fully recovered from the destruction of this defeat, with its repercussions lasting until 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. As a direct result, all of Hungary was lost within three years, followed by all of Serbia in ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. Western armies, including Austrian and Hungarian forces, advanced as far as Thessaloniki and the south of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. French intervention, motivated by a desire to prevent Austria from becoming too powerful, attacked Austria from behind, forcing its retreat and preventing the complete loss of the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

The defeat at Vienna caused a tremendous shock, leading to the collapse of Ottoman administrative and military control in the Balkans, which could not be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. This also led to the emergence of many independent principalities within Anatolia, effectively ending Ottoman rule there from 1680 until the Tanzimat period in the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

### The European Balance of Power
For Western powers, the Battle of Vienna shattered the perception of the Ottoman Empire as an invincible force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Despite this, Western states did not fully exploit their advantage to conquer Istanbul, primarily due to fierce competition among European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This period marked a significant shift in [[American and European political dynamics | European foreign policy]] towards managing the balance of power among themselves, rather than engaging in a unified war against the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. The 1683 incident is considered a turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

## German-Russian Dynamics and the Fate of Poland

### Poland's Geopolitical Fears
Poland views the Ukrainian War as a fundamental issue of existence and non-existence, becoming the country most committed to supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This stance is rooted in Poland's deep-seated fear of a potential German-Russian rapprochement, which has historically led to disastrous consequences for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. Poland's strategic realities necessitate fighting against such an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

### Historical Partitions of Poland
The historical pattern of German-Russian cooperation at Poland's expense has been observed multiple times. For instance, in 1772, when Poland was in a close alliance with Prussia, Russia intervened, ostensibly to "save Poland from German influence," leading to Russia annexing about half of Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. Prussia then took another third, and subsequently, the rest of Poland was completely partitioned by 1790, with Germany, Russia, and Austria dividing the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>.

### The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
This historical precedent resurfaced in 1939 with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty, where Germany and Russia, despite being ideological enemies, suddenly declared an alliance and invaded Poland a week later, effectively partitioning it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

### Contemporary German Foreign Policy
Currently, Germany projects an image of economic distress and political incompetence, with politicians frequently stating they are "very stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. However, this could be a deceptive tactic, as propaganda often aims to mislead. Germany's economic performance, despite these claims, might be at historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Therefore, one should be prepared for surprises regarding German foreign policy, as other states must consider the possibility of Germany launching a "counterattack" in its geopolitical strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

## The Rise and Fall of European Communist Parties

### Post-1991 Collapse
After 1991, communist parties across the Western world largely disintegrated, vanishing from the political scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>. Some attempted to pivot to issues like women's rights, which proved to be a dead end, causing them to lose their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. Others clung to strict Marxism, shrinking into insignificant entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>.

### Factors in Decline
The collapse of communist parties, which once commanded 40-50% of the vote in some European countries after World War I, can be attributed to three main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>:

1.  **Weakening of the Working-Class Movement**: The primary power source of communist parties was the century-old European working-class movement, which fought for workers' rights and social improvement through solidarity and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. After 1945, this movement rapidly lost influence and was marginalized as an organized political force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:28">[01:31:28]</a>.
2.  **Loss of Soviet Support**: During the Cold War, communist parties functioned as instruments of the Soviet Union, receiving organizational, financial, and even psychological support through international solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. This support was largely cut off by 1987-88, leading to the parties' collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>.
3.  **End of Persecution**: Historically, shared persecution and victimization fostered a strong sense of brotherhood and solidarity among communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. Once Western states ceased prosecuting them, this unifying factor diminished, leading to internal disinterest and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

### The Greek Exception
The Greek Communist Party, unlike its counterparts, still garners around 7% of the vote, making it comparatively strong (e.g., French Communist Party gets 2%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. This resilience is attributed to the living memories of Greece's brutal civil war in the 1940s and the heavy persecution communists faced during the Greek colonels' junta (1967-1974) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a>. These historical struggles and their lingering memory continue to give the party social resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.

## Calvinism: A Force for Republicanism in Europe

Calvinism, considered a more radical branch of Protestantism, played a very important role in European history during the 16th, 17th, and even 18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. Its fundamental difference from mainstream Protestantism was its strong anti-monarchical stance from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

### Anti-Monarchical Roots
Calvinism began as a rebellion against monarchies and the aristocracy, becoming the main address of the republican movement in the European tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. Key Calvinist strongholds in Europe included:
*   **Switzerland**: Geneva (an independent state at the time), and the cantons of Uri and Bern, which became centers of anti-monarchist republicanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Holland**: Another important pillar of Calvinism, with its federation of republics, despite eventually accepting a semi-monarchical order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.
*   **Scotland**: The Scottish Church faithfully continued the Calvinist tradition despite losing independence to the English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
*   **Germany**: Independent city-states in the north like Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck were Calvinist strongholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.
*   **France**: French Calvinists (Huguenots) fought a long civil war against the royal family, were defeated, and many emigrated, with some forming the core of Berlin's future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

Common to these groups was their classification as "terrorists" by the existing order due to their opposition to monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

### Influence on American Democracy
In America, Calvinists played a significant role, particularly in New England states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, which became strongholds of Calvinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. Their distinguishing feature was Presbyterianism, which rejects a senior priestly ruling class, instead asserting that each congregation is a democratic structure making its own decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This tradition, emphasizing self-governance and decision-making through assemblies elected by equal congregations, lies at the basis of American democracy and its republican understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. This differs from Episcopalian (Anglican) structures which have an upper clergy class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

### Calvinism in the Islamic World
While the speaker admits insufficient knowledge to give specific historical examples, he suggests that Islam's social structure and legal understanding are closer to the Presbyterian/Calvinist model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. In Islam, the consensus of the *ummah* (community) and the opinion of the *ulema* (scholars) often prevail, and the community has historically been skeptical of state intervention in law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. This suggests a strong "Calvinist vein" in Islam until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

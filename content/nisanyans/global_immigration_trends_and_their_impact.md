Recent global developments indicate that [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]] has reached unprecedented dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. This phenomenon is observed not only in specific regions like Turkey, but across the entire Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## Current Migration Statistics

In the [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | United States]], approximately 260,000 illegal immigrants entered the country within 30 days in the last month, with the total number, including unregistered individuals, estimated at 500,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. This trend has been escalating, with more arrivals each month over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. Projections estimate that 2 million people will enter the [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | United States]] from the Mexican border by the end of 2023, an event of historic proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

A similar situation is occurring in [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | Europe]], where large numbers of people are migrating from the Mediterranean to Italy by boat, and then on to other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. This [[mass_migration_and_its_societal_impact | mass migration]] is considered to be of a scale that could potentially "destroy [[impact_of_social_and_economic_transformations_on_humanity | social fabrics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

## Reasons for Encouraged Illegal Immigration

The practical encouragement of illegal [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]] by Western countries raises questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. Borders in the [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | United States]] are described as having become like a "roadside inn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

Two main possibilities are considered for governments' inaction or encouragement:

### 1. Incompetence and Irresponsibility
One explanation points to a "complete stupidity and incompetence and irresponsibility" among the leadership cadres of Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. The quality of current leadership is seen as "unparalleled" in its inadequacy, with examples like Justin Trudeau in [[impact_of_immigration_policies_in_canada | Canada]] and Annalena Baerbock in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

### 2. Need for Cheap Labor
A more weighty explanation suggests a conscious policy to encourage [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]] due to a demand for cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

Factors contributing to this need:
*   **High Cost of Domestic Labor:** Employing citizens in Western countries, such as the [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | United States]] and [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | Europe]], is deemed very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Local workers demand wages that businesses cannot afford, factoring in social rights, human rights, and other entitlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Demographic Collapse:** There is a significant decrease in the number of white Europeans and white Americans, leading to an incredibly increasing average age and a shortage of people available for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

Historically, this problem was addressed by outsourcing industry to China 20-30 years ago, leveraging its cheap and quality labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. However, this policy proved problematic as it eliminated industrial infrastructure in countries like North America and England, making them unable to produce essential goods like tanks today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

## A "Modern Slavery System"

The current approach to [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]] seems to favor illegal entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. This allows immigrants to be employed cheaply and provides an easy mechanism for deportation in case of social unrest or minor infractions, as they lack legal status or have vague documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. This system is described as a "fairly modern slavery system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

The American continent's history of importing millions of slaves from Africa in past centuries to grow rich is noted as a parallel to this new phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The rational dimension of this "great migration" is explained as a deliberate effort to secure a large, cheap, and controllable labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

During a live broadcast from Russia, the speaker encountered significant internet disruptions. These issues were attributed to security measures implemented following a [[drone_attack_on_the_kremlin_and_its_effects | drone attack]] on the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Cause of Disruptions
Approximately two to three months prior to the broadcast, a [[drone_attack_on_the_kremlin_and_its_effects | drone attack]] occurred on the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To counter and confuse drones, internet access was intentionally cut off for about one minute every ten minutes within a one-kilometer radius of the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This measure was designed to disrupt drone operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The speaker noted that their previous location was directly across from the square at the country's center, near Putin's office, which was subject to these security measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Impact on Broadcast
The disruptions caused significant technical difficulties, leading to frequent interruptions during the live broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. The speaker initially stayed in a "luxurious hotel" where these disadvantages were experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Solutions and Observations
To resolve the connectivity issues, the speaker moved to a different location that was more budget-friendly but offered "wonderful internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It was observed that "no problem-free internet" existed in the city generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Advice received by the speaker included:
*   Using a VPN would have allowed for better broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Moving two blocks away to a cafe would have avoided the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Going out on a balcony was forbidden due to concerns about potential rifle attacks, given the proximity to Putin's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Despite these specific internet issues, the speaker noted that there was "not the slightest sign that this country is at war," with normal life, including concerts, cinemas, and theaters, continuing routinely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. There were no visible signs of fear or tension, nor a significant police or military presence on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

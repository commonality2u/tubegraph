The speaker notes that while social media companies and advertisers collect vast amounts of data, their effectiveness in using this data for targeted advertising is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Despite claims that algorithms can predict user behavior with precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, the speaker asserts a "100% 0 guess rate" for themselves, suggesting that randomly sent advertisements would be more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that the billions spent on collecting this data for advertising purposes are largely useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## State Intelligence vs. Advertising Data Collection

A key distinction is drawn between data collection for advertising and data collection by states:
*   **Advertising**: Companies collect data for marketing, but the speaker views this as a "complete but flawless failure" in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Even without results, advertisers persist because "everyone is doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **States**: The speaker contends that the "real information collectors" are the [[legal_system_and_state_power|police and intelligence forces of the states]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. These entities learn "everything about you from the moment you enter social media" and "write it down somewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Motivation for State Data Collection

Unlike advertisers who face a feedback mechanism (lack of sales), state organizations operate differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Their incomes and salaries are paid by taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Therefore, the usefulness of the information they collect does not concern them, as long as they appear to be fulfilling their function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Albanian immigration to Turkey can be understood through distinct historical periods and groups, rather than a single, monolithic movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.

## Ottoman Era Albanian Elite
Historically, the Albanian Bey (ruling) class were among the most loyal servants and allies of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>. They consistently held powerful positions within the Ottoman state hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a> and undertook critical tasks in governing non-Muslim populations in the Balkans, from the southern tip of Greece to Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>. Consequently, many individuals of Albanian origin were present in the Ottoman ruling, military, ulema, and cultured classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>.

## Mass Migration Post-Balkan Wars
The mass migration of ordinary Albanians to Turkey primarily occurred after the Balkan Wars in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. This wave of migration was largely driven by Muslim Albanians who found it inconvenient to live under Christian rule in newly established or expanded Christian states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>.

Key points about this migration:
*   **Origin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>:
    *   Most migrants were *not* from the country later known as Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>.
    *   The majority came from regions that fell under Christian rule, such as Greece, Serbia, Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:47:59]</a>, and especially Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>.
    *   Many Albanians in Turkey today trace their origins to Macedonia or Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>, with some from the Yenipazar Sanjak or Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:28">[01:48:28]</a>.
*   **Timeline**: This migration continued from 1912 until the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>.

## Recent Albanian Immigration
Following the independence of Albania and subsequent periods of economic and political crisis, a smaller number of Albanians have immigrated to Turkey, primarily after the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.

## Distinguishing Characteristics
These different waves of Albanian immigration can be distinguished, particularly through naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>:
*   **Early Waves (Ottoman elite, post-Balkan Wars)**: Individuals from the first and second groups typically have classical Muslim names (e.g., Ahmet, Mehmet, Fatma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:38">[01:49:38]</a>. This is because they were predominantly Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>.
*   **Recent Wave (post-1990s Albania)**: Those who immigrated from Albania in the last 20-30 years often carry distinct Albanian names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. This is due to policies in Albania since the 1940s (under Enver Hoxha) that discouraged Muslim names in favor of neutral, non-religious, secular Albanian names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:47">[01:49:47]</a>.

The speaker notes that the subject of Albanian migration to Anatolia is one they know "very little" about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>.

## Introduction to Nationalism
The feeling of "us" or "ours" is a fundamental human instinct, embodying a deep sense of belonging to a group, defending its realities, and sacrificing for its interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, the idea of establishing states based on [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nationality]] is a modern concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, emerging in the late 18th century, particularly after the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Evolution of Statehood
Before the advent of modern [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | nationalism]], various forms of states existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>:
*   **City-states**: Nations comprising a city and its controlled provincial area exhibited a strong sense of solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Citizens gathered in assemblies, making decisions through semi-democratic or oligarchic methods, and were willing to sacrifice for the city's honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Confederations**: Intermediate forms like the Swiss and Dutch Confederations also existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Kingdoms**: Most serious states were not based on a sense of [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]], but on loyalty to a sovereign dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Loyalty to the dynasty and religious affiliation were strong motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### The Rise of Modern Nationalism
The mentality of a state based on nationality emerged in 1792 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. When European states coalesced to overthrow the revolutionary regime, France introduced compulsory military service for the first time in European history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This meant every citizen was obligated to join the army upon the state's call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This radical innovation was linked to two key ideas:
1.  **The Republic**: Citizens must feel the state is "their state" and that they are equal to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The governing cadres had to represent the people, creating a narrative that "we are the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
2.  **The Nation-State**: The concept of a [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]] governing itself as a subject, distinct from a looting horde or dynasty, became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This new state theory, synonymous with the [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]], spread rapidly from the early 1800s, influencing countries like Spain and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Germany, previously a mosaic of 300-odd independent entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, saw the emergence of the idea that a German [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]] must have a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## [[Political history of Turkey | Nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]] and [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Turkey]]
The Ottoman Empire, around the 1820s, also started to implement modern army reforms and compulsory military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Prior to Mahmud II's reign, military service was a professional occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, often passed down through families like the Janissaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. Soldiers earned income, spoils from wars, and were exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

With the introduction of compulsory military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>, a population administration was established, conducting censuses and issuing papers to men for drafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. In multi-ethnic societies like the Ottoman Empire, this policy led to unexpected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. According to Islamic law, non-Muslims were forbidden from carrying weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Therefore, non-Muslims were allowed to pay a fee instead of serving in the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

This exemption had profound [[Historical and social overview of Turkey and its evolution | socio-economic impacts]]:
*   **Economic Advantage for Non-Muslims**: Since non-Muslims paid a fee instead of serving, they were compelled to engage in income-generating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This contributed to their significant economic development in the Ottoman Empire from the 1830s to the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Disadvantage for Muslims**: Conversely, Muslim peasants, primarily Turks and Balkan Muslims, perished in constant wars, unable to establish businesses or manage their fields effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. They became weak and could not create sustainable fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
*   **Rise of Nationalism and Conflict**: The disparity led to resentment. Vehbi Koç, a prominent figure in [[modernization_and_secularism_in_Turkish_history | Turkish]] history, observed that while Turks served in the military and died, Armenians and Jews paid fees and prospered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. This sentiment fueled the idea that it was "their right" to plunder non-Muslim properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Figures like Vehbi Koç, Sakıp Sabancı's father, and Eczacıbaşı gained wealth from the looted properties of Armenian communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This tragic process, born from the Ottoman Empire's "stupid policy," formed the foundation of the Republican regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

The policy of compulsory military service also led to the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. As the state became identified with the "dominant [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, minority groups (Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Arabs, Armenians) began to argue that if the state was not "their country," they should establish their own states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, a typical "disease" of the 19th and 20th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Notable Figures and Cultural Impact
### Mehmet Ali Pasha of Egypt
The speaker suggests that the person who served "Turkishness" the most in [[Historical and Political Analysis of Trkiye | modern history]] is not Atatürk, but rather Egyptian Mehmet Ali Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Mehmet Ali Pasha, an Albanian from Kavala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>, seized power in Egypt and established the new Egyptian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. While his private language might have been Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>, Turkish became the common, high, and business language for rulers in the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. The ruling classes of the newly established Egyptian state spoke Turkish throughout the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Until the mid-20th century, Turkish was the state language of Egypt, with Turkish newspapers and poems being published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This demonstrates an intense Turkification of the elite society in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

## Contemporary State of Nationalism
In the 21st century, the sense of [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | nationalism]], particularly loyalty to a state based on national identity, is rapidly deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. Compulsory general military service, a key driver of 19th-century [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | nationalism]], has been disappearing globally over the last 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. In Western societies, the idea of sacrificing one's life for the homeland has become an "absurd idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a> with no credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. In [[Historical and social overview of Turkey and its evolution | Turkey]], while a "soldier [[concept_and_evolution_of_nation_in_Turkey | nation]]" sentiment still exists among some, it is rapidly going out of fashion among the well-off and educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

As [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | nationalism]] wanes, the future might see the rise of powerful core organizations based on force of arms, with members loyal to each other, and their growing federations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This is observed in regions like Latin America, where mafia organizations increasingly determine social dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This shift suggests a move towards anarchy in an era of intense conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

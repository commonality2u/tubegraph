Colonialism, as a historical phenomenon, presents a complex reality that cannot be reduced to simple black and white narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. While some argue that it benefited certain countries, a closer examination reveals a nuanced and often devastating impact.

## Perceived Benefits vs. Widespread Discontent

The notion that colonialism benefited some countries, as stubbornly defended by some, is generally not accepted by those who experienced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. In countries historically dominated by British and French colonialism, such as African nations, India, Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam), there is a consensus among intelligent and informed segments that the British administration was not beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. No one from these regions wishes it had continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

While some in India acknowledge British contributions like establishing railways, this does not translate into a defense of colonialism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. Even if a peaceful legal order existed in places like Sri Lanka before 1948 that couldn't be sustained post-independence, it does not justify colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. This perspective highlights a strong emotional struggle against the admiration for the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## British Rule in India: A Case Study

British rule in India can be divided into two distinct periods:
*   **18th Century (First Century)**: This period was characterized by "disgrace" and "robbery," with no other purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. India was arguably the richest country in the world at the time, economically developed with high trade volume, luxury production, and a large population, possibly richer than Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. The British, primarily through a private company operating on behalf of the English ruling classes, engaged in "armed robbery" and "destroyed" India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **After 1850 (Second Century)**: The British government took over administration, realizing that continued exploitation required protecting infrastructure and providing education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. Investments were made with the clear aim of earning more back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. They established a new education system and school network suitable for the modern world to raise a new group of educated locals loyal to the British, who could be employed in second-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.

## Long-term Consequences and the Rise of [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | Nationalism]]

The education provided under colonial rule inadvertently fostered the very forces that would challenge it. By instilling British values and teaching English, the colonial powers equipped local populations with the tools to question and resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. If the British could govern their own country, why couldn't Indians govern theirs? This simple logic led to the rise of anti-colonial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

Leaders of these movements, particularly in Africa and India, were often people who had received Western education and adopted contemporary ideas from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. They then understood the natural and logical consequences, leading to demands for self-governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

## Mandates and the Partitioning of the Middle East

The concept of a "mandate" emerged after World War I, particularly concerning the Ottoman Empire's former territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. A British mandate for Turkey was never politically feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. Instead, an American mandate was proposed for the defeated Turkey, where a rich country (the new nation-state of Turkey) would have American consultants guiding its ministries, tax policies, and system re-establishment for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. However, this was deemed unrealistic and abandoned, mainly because Turkey was a country of immense historical importance and granting it to one European power would spark conflict with others like Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. The US, being a neutral and distant power, was seen as a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

In contrast, Arab countries like Syria and Iraq were "torn apart" due to oil interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Britain desired Iraq's oil resources, and to maintain the European balance of power, an equivalent piece (Syria) was given to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. These regions had not been states for 800 years and lacked administrative staff, national consciousness, and established institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. Turkey, however, had been an empire for centuries with political integrity and a state consciousness, making direct colonial rule impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This illustrates the varied application of colonial policies and their [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | Impact of Historical Events on Current Geopolitics]].

## Imperialism Beyond Western Colonialism

The discussion also touches upon a broader definition of imperialism, noting that the content of the term "imperialist" can differ across religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

### Islamic Imperialism
Islam, with "jihad" as a basic principle, rapidly expanded in its early centuries, establishing the "greatest empire" from Spain to India within 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. This marked a significant imperial expansion, followed by a second wave with the Seljuks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

### Christian Imperialism (Response to Islamic Expansion)
The Christian world, initially established as the religion of an existing empire, showed no tendency towards expansionism until the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>. Confronted with Islamic expansion and its perceived advancements, Europeans began to adopt similar strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. The Crusades are viewed as a "response to Islamic imperialism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. This included the establishment of military organizations like the German Knights' Organization (Dacia) in Palestine, whose aim was to defend Christianity militarily and expand it by force, learning techniques from Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. This led to the forced Christianization of Baltic states in the 13th century, a practice learned from Muslim methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

### Modern Anti-Imperialism
In the 20th century, particularly after the 1970s, an "anti-imperialist dimension of Islam" was "discovered," allowing it to gain an ethos of resistance against others' imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[historical_perspectives_on_empires_and_cultural_narratives | Historical Perspectives on Empires and Cultural Narratives]].

## The Question of Honor in Post-Colonial States

The discussion also touches on the challenge for an individual to protect their honor in Turkey without falling into a state of being "not accepted by the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. Telling the truth, or what one believes to be true, goes "against the genetic structure" of the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. The Republican regime emphasized propaganda and identified internal enemies, persecuting those who challenged official narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. This has historically made it "impossible" for honorable individuals to exist without facing severe consequences such as imprisonment, exile, murder, or the destruction of their lives and reputations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. This highlights the enduring [[impact_of_historical_colonial_influences_on_modernday_morocco | historical colonial influences]] and their effect on national identity and governance.

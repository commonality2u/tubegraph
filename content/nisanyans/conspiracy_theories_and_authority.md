## The Nature of Conspiracy Theories
The existence of [[phantom_time_conspiracy_theory_and_its_implications | conspiracy theories]] is seen as inversely proportional to the trust in authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The term "Conspiracy Theory," often used as an accusation or something despised, emerges precisely because trust in authority is shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. When public belief in authority is diminished, people tend to enter an "extra Turbo mode" to produce alternative theories, questioning if they are being lied to and seeking the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

### A Healthy Endeavor
The act of people producing these theories is considered a "healthy thing" and a "good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. It reflects an effort to discover the secrets behind apparent truths, rather than blindly submitting to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. While half or even ninety percent of such theories might be wrong, the effort itself is commendable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

For instance, when states announced a terrible pandemic, urging people to stay home and wear masks ("diaper tied to your mouth"), questioning why such "nonsense" is being imposed is viewed as an honorable, intelligent, and ethical behavior, rather than blindly complying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

## Authority's Response to Dissent
The labeling of something as a "theory" by those in authority is often a tactic to denigrate efforts to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.
The implication of the term "Conspiracy Theory" is that the person expressing it is mentally ill and might require hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. This approach mirrors practices in the Soviet Union during the Brezhnev period, where individuals asking questions were labeled as crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

Therefore, individuals who dismiss any opinion by labeling it a "Conspiracy Theory" are considered unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. Such people, who seek to exclude and silence dissenting voices, are seen as a social threat and danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

> [!INFO] Historical Parallels in Discrediting Dissent
> Disqualifying individuals who do not conform to the official discourse by labeling their views as "Conspiracy Theory" has historical parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>:
> *   Once, such people were accused of being heretics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
> *   They were called "perverts" or accused of having "sold their souls to the devil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
> *   Later, they were branded as "agents of imperialism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
> *   Today, they are simply called "Conspiracy theorists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

The speaker also criticizes the state of American politics, stating that the current regime in the United States, especially since 2001, cannot accurately be described as a democracy but rather a very serious [[understanding_the_concept_of_dictatorship | dictatorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. The choice between presidential candidates, one "senile" and the other "mentally ill," exemplifies a blocked system where public opinion has no effective recourse against what essentially functions as a [[historical_and_contemporary_dictatorship_comparisons | dictatorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

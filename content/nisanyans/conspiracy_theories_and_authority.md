[[conspiracy_theories_and_public_trust_in_information | Conspiracy theories]] are inherently linked to public trust in authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. Their prevalence is inversely proportional to the level of trust and belief in authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>.

## Emergence and Function
When trust in authority is shaken, people tend to enter an "extra Turbo mode" to produce theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. This often stems from a suspicion that authorities are lying, leading to an active pursuit of the perceived truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. This act of questioning and theorizing is described as a "healthy thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.

Instead of blindly submitting to authority, the effort to discover secrets behind official narratives is considered beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>. Even if a significant portion (e.g., ninety percent) of these theories prove incorrect, the act of making the effort itself is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:27">[01:43:27]</a>.

For example, questioning official narratives during a pandemic regarding public health measures (like staying home or wearing masks) and seeking underlying reasons is characterized as an "honorable," "intelligent," and "ethical behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.

## Authority's Response
The term "[[conspiracy_theories_and_public_trust_in_information | Conspiracy Theory]]" is viewed as a tool used by those in power to disparage the public's attempts to understand complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:12">[01:44:12]</a>. This label often implies mental illness, suggesting that those who question authority might need hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a>. This tactic mirrors historical practices, such as labeling questioners as "crazy" in the Soviet Union during the Brezhnev era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">[01:44:34]</a>.

Individuals who dismiss dissenting opinions by labeling them as "[[conspiracy_theories_and_public_trust_in_information | Conspiracy Theories]]" are seen as unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>. From this perspective, such individuals believe that those who do not comply with the authoritative discourse are a "social threat and danger" that should be "excluded" and "silenced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. This method of discrediting is a modern equivalent of historical accusations like "heretics," "perverts," or "agents of imperialism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:23">[01:45:23]</a>.

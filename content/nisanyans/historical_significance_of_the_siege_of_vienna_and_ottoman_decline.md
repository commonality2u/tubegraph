The Siege of Vienna in 1683 holds immense historical significance as a major turning point that signaled the definitive decline of the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] and reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. The Ottomans had a long-standing obsession with conquering Vienna, attempting it in both 1860 and 1683 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

## State of the Ottoman Empire Pre-1683
Prior to the 1683 siege, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] had been in a state of stagnation for over a century, unable to expand its territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. Its wars often devolved into prolonged, "blind fights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. The Empire had already lost its technological and economic superiority against European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. Despite this, figures like Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa aimed to achieve what Kanuni Sultan SÃ¼leyman (Suleiman the Magnificent) could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

## The Siege of Vienna (1683)
In 1683, the Ottomans besieged Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. During the prolonged siege, Polish King Jan Sobieski unexpectedly arrived from the north with an estimated 100,000 cavalry army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. His forces inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Turkish army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

## Immediate and Long-Term Consequences
The defeat at Vienna was a catastrophe from which the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] never fully recovered, with its impact lingering until 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

The immediate aftermath saw significant territorial losses:
*   All of Hungary was lost within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.
*   All of Serbia was lost within ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   Austrian and Hungarian armies advanced as far as Thessaloniki and southern Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.
*   While France's intervention prevented Austria from becoming too powerful, temporarily saving parts of the Balkans for the Ottomans, a profound shock led to the collapse of Ottoman administrative and military control in the region, which could not be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

Domestically, the defeat led to widespread fragmentation:
*   Numerous principalities emerged within Anatolia, including regions like Lazistan, the eastern provinces, Egypt, and central Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   These principalities collected their own taxes, maintained armies, and challenged the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]], only occasionally paying tribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   From 1680 onwards, effective [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman]] rule in Anatolia ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   For 140 years, until the Tanzimat period in the 1820s, the Ottomans operated largely on inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. They struggled to collect taxes, and provinces reverted to a "Stone Age" state, leading to ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

For Western powers, the Battle of Vienna shattered the perception of the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] as an invincible force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Despite this, Western states did not immediately seize Istanbul due to their own internal rivalries and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. From this point, Europe shifted its foreign policy from a unified war against the Muslim world to managing the balance of power among themselves. The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] was no longer the primary feared power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. The 1683 incident is therefore considered a crucial turning point in [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman]] and European history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

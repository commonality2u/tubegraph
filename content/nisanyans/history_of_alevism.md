Alevism is described as a very closed society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The speaker initially had little knowledge of Alevism, only hearing about it in Istanbul before university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. His understanding deepened after attending the Hacıbektaş festival around 1977-78 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, making friends, and frequently visiting Tunceli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Later, in 1996-97, he extensively read literature on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## [[historical_origins_of_alevism | Origins and Development]]

The Alevism phenomenon, as it is known today, largely crystallized between the 1400s and 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

It began as a significant revolutionary movement from the Safavid dynasty in Ardabil, Iran, led by figures like Ayfar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and Shah Ismail across three generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This movement was a protest against classical Islam and a religious reform against Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, interestingly coinciding with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

This movement became so powerful that it threatened the existence of the Ottoman Empire, starting in the later years of Fatih Sultan Mehmet and escalating during the reign of Beyazıt II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It was eventually suppressed by Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Earlier Roots of Rebellion

While the Alevi movement crystallized in the 15th-16th centuries, it had earlier roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In the 1200s, there were significant rebellions in Anatolia, such as those led by Baba Ishak and Baba Ilyas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Remnants of various movements like Hurufism and Batinism also existed in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

A significant factor was the large number of people in Anatolia who had converted to Islam, often newly and under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. These groups harbored unrest, contributing to a rebellion movement that unified various resistance centers and spread across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Ottoman Persecution

The Ottoman state viewed this Alevi movement as a deadly ideological threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. For centuries, the Ottomans ruthlessly suppressed the Alevi movement, crushing it, exiling people to mountains, and executing those declared illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. They used all oppressive tools to try and destroy Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

While persecution slowed in the 18th century, it re-intensified in the 19th century during the suppression of the Janissary Corps, leading to violent persecution of Alevis and Bektashis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Alevis never had good relations with the state, living illegally, fleeing to mountains, and constantly hiding their identity and worshipping secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Core Beliefs and Characteristics]]

Alevism's fundamental theme is [[alevi_as_a_rebellion_movement | resistance against Islamic bigotry]], Islamic law, and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Alevism defines itself as Muslim, yet rejects many basic Islamic rules and practices of Sunni Islam, such as fasting (or practicing it differently), Sharia law, pilgrimage, and zakat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Alevis accept Ali as the true caliph after Muhammad and follow the 12 Imams who descended from his lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Eclectic Influences

Alevism is an eclectic movement, drawing from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>:
*   **Central Asian Turkish Traditions:** Elements from Shamanist Turks who resisted Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Traditions:** A significant portion of Kurds, who were not fully Muslim for centuries and carried local traditions, joined the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Christianity:** Obvious effects of Christianity are seen in the figure of Ali, who is similar to Jesus, having 12 followers like Jesus's disciples, and traditions resembling Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Pre-Islamic Middle Eastern Traditions:** Including elements from Syrian Alevis (Nusayris) and other anti-Islamic Middle Eastern ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Organizational Structure

Unlike Iranian Shiism, which has a strong madrasah tradition, academic framework, and mullah hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, Turkish Alevism lacks such a central organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Instead, it relies on local dedes who continue a shamanic and traditional religious leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The lineage and "hearths" (ocaks) of these dedes are documented in literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

## [[cultural_evolution_of_alevi_society | Cultural Evolution and Demographics]]

Historically, Alevism's dominant geography formed a clear triangle region in Anatolia, including Sivas (especially Divriği, Kangal), Tunceli, Erzincan, parts of Tokat, Amasya, and narrowing towards Maraş in the south of Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This region strongly overlaps with the spread of the Paulician rebellion against the Byzantine Orthodox Church in the 8th-9th centuries, with Divriği being a key center for both movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Alevism has acted as a "bag" or "common pot" for various elements that were not comfortable with Islam for different reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Because leaving Islam was punishable by death in the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, Alevism offered a nominal Muslim identity while providing an anti-state and anti-establishment outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Today, Alevi communities are diverse:
*   Approximately half of Alevis in Turkey identify as ethnically Turkish and attach importance to Turkmen and Central Asian origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   Around 40% are of [[history_and_impact_of_alevi_kurdish_society | Kurdish origin]], speaking Kurdish, and do not necessarily identify as Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
*   In Antakya and Hatay, there is an Arab Alevi population (Nusayris), who have a distinct tradition and close ties to Arab Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Syrian Alevis on the Mediterranean coast are also largely Alevi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   There are Alevis in Albania (Bektashis, especially in the Orthodox south) and Bulgarian Alevis in the Rhodope Mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   Specific groups like the Tahtacı (forest villagers in the Aegean and Mediterranean coastal mountains) and Abdals (involved in music and entertainment, often associated with Romani, e.g., Neşet Ertaş) are also considered Alevi but have distinct cultures and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

## [[relationship_between_alevism_and_turkish_identity | Alevism and Turkish Identity]]

Alevism is seen as a patchwork of different phenomena unified by a common opposition to the state and dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. For centuries, Alevis have been in conflict with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

### [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Association with Kemalism]]

Despite their historical opposition to the state, many Alevis vote for the CHP (Republican People's Party) due to their strong association with Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. This stems from Alevis' core opposition to Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Kemalism and its secularism offered Alevis, for the first time, a sense of belonging within the state and an opportunity for upward mobility (e.g., becoming civil servants, police, generals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Kemalism is seen as their "only handle" against the weakening of Sunni ideology's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

However, Kemalism is viewed as a "dead end" policy, doomed to be a minority and defeat in Turkey's democratic landscape, where Islamic ideology is dominant among the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

### [[influence_of_alevism_on_turkish_leftist_movements | Influence on Turkish Leftist Movements]]

In the 1960s, Alevis briefly engaged with moderate right-wing politics, even forming the Turkish Unity Party, which gained significant support in places like Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. However, this party quickly shifted to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

By the 1970s, Alevis largely moved to the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The revolutionary youth leadership of the 1970s was overwhelmingly from the Alevi community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. This influx transformed Turkish leftism from an elite movement into a widespread youth phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

Alevi culture significantly shaped the Turkish left in the 1970s, influencing its folk songs, social customs, and the balance it sought between rural and urban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. Consequently, the bağlama (a stringed instrument) and Alevi "nefes" (breaths/folk songs) became symbols of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. This also led to the Turkish left's primary platform being anti-Muslim, as the attitude towards religion became the main criterion distinguishing left from non-left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

### Identity and Upbringing

Many Alevis, particularly those who have adapted to modern life, maintain a foundational skepticism towards official state narratives. This stems from family upbringing that instilled a distrust of "official lies" and aggressive state statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. This upbringing often leads to a natural inclination to question authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. However, there is concern about how long this unique foundation will last, given the Turkish state's effectiveness in assimilating populations over generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

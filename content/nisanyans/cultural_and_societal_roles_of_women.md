## Perceived Representation in Various Fields

The speaker observes a scarcity of prominent women in various cultural and professional domains across different eras and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes:
*   Visual arts and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean culture, and among American natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   [[cultural_and_societal_transformations_in_the_western_and_islamic_worlds | Islamic culture]], where there are "few" good writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   Politics, with very few Turkish examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

It is asserted that a class of geniuses from women does not typically emerge in some fields, even when opportunities are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The speaker dismisses the explanation that this lack of representation is due to oppression and male domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Biological and Psychological Differences

A central argument is that women and men possess different biological functions and genetic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This distinction, informed by human psychology, brings unique psychological advantages and disadvantages for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The primary biological function of a woman is defined as giving birth, ensuring the child's safety, looking after, feeding, and preventing the child's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Conversely, men are seen as compensating for their biological "dysfunctions," weaknesses, or insignificance in other fields through their skills and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This perspective views humans as not significantly different from monkeys, and the functions of men and women in mammals are described as obvious and logical, reflecting obligatory procedural differences rooted in biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Modern Society and [[equality_and_rights_of_women_in_modern_society | Equality]]

In contemporary society, where certain "tactile functions" have acquired complex, unnatural qualities, discussions around granting women rights and determining the degree of [[equality_and_rights_of_women_in_modern_society | equality]] are deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, the underlying premise for understanding human [[social_roles_and_dynamics_in_various_regions | social organization]] remains that humans are animals, akin to a decorated gorilla or orangutan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Ultimately, the human being is characterized as an animal whose fundamental functions revolve around sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In these core functions, women and men have distinct capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The speaker asserts that these are objective facts, despite an age that sometimes respects "ideological lies more than objective truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The distinction between older forms of knowledge, such as "madrasah science" or "Scholastic science" in Europe, and the "new sciences" dominant since the 17th century, is complex and not as stark as commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

## Traditional Science (Madrasah/Scholastic)
Traditional science, including Islamic madrasah sciences and European scholasticism, functioned as a comprehensive information system. It provided explanations for the universe's formation, the origin of animals, the shaping of human morality, and historical events, answering fundamental questions about life and existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. This system saw a revival in the Middle Ages, particularly from the 13th century onward, and developed extremely sophisticated and rational discussions based on religious foundations, whether from the Church in the West or Islamic scripture in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

However, common simplistic distinctions, such as old science being dogma-based while new science relies on observation and experimentation, are dismissed as "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. Similarly, stating that one is based on mathematical systems and the other on revelation is only "partially true," as not all modern sciences (e.g., biology, linguistics) are mathematically based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

## Key Differences

The speaker identifies two primary differences:

### 1. Written Infrastructure and Institutional Sclerosis
Traditional science suffered from a strong dependence on written infrastructure, particularly sacred texts like the Holy Book, Old Testament, Church elders' testaments, Quran, and Hadiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. While scientific theories were built upon these, the existing cognitive framework and hypotheses eventually became insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.

The core issue was an "institutional sclerosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>. Knowledge was bound by institutional ties, making it difficult to abandon long-standing assumptions, even when they contradicted new understanding (e.g., the creation of the world in six days or mountains preventing earthquakes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>. To advance, one had to break free from these established frameworks, which required a "courage" to reject the religious institutional framework, a step seen in the West but not in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

### 2. Technological Application as Validation
The second crucial difference lies in the validation of knowledge. Older scientific understanding was weak in this aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. In contrast, the new understanding of science, prevalent since the 17th century, strongly emphasizes testing knowledge through technical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>.

This means that the proof of information's accuracy shifted from conformity with sacred texts and established authorities to its technological applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. This principle, while not universal to all sciences (e.g., biology, linguistics), became a dominant idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>. The question of whether this distinction still holds true for 21st-century science is posed as a subject for reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>.

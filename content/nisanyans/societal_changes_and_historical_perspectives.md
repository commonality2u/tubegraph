## Political and Economic Transformations in Modern History

The contemporary era has witnessed significant [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical and modern societal transformations]], particularly in governance and global economics. The decision by Donald Trump to abandon imposing tariffs on electronic goods, influenced by a phone call from Apple's chairman Tim Cook, is considered by some to be "the most humiliating defeat an American government has suffered in modern history and in the last 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This event occurred despite Trump's stated aim to redesign the world economy and initiate a trade war, which had led to stock market and international relations upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This quick and definitive defeat is a rare occurrence in political life, making it difficult to predict the longevity and credibility of Trump's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Over the past two months, numerous bold initiatives by the US government, such as conquering Greenland, Canada, declaring war on Mexico, Iran, and China, and ending the war in Ukraine, have been announced but have not been followed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. All these initiatives, including attempts to establish a new alliance with Russia, have reportedly ended in defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This suggests that the administration's primary strategy is bluffing to obtain concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. However, constant, failed bluffs erode credibility, rendering future threats ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The rapid collapse of the most radical economic transformation decision in 80-100 years, within days, raises questions about how any political player can sustain their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Bureaucracy and Public Services

### Challenges of Bureaucratic Expansion
Western countries, including the USA, Canada, France, Belgium, and Spain, face significant national debt despite efforts to control public spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This situation points to the ongoing expansion of bureaucracy and the presence of "parasitic bureaucratic structures" in all [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western and modern countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While many individuals in these structures are simply trying to make a living, it is evident that a significant portion are part of a "bloated like cancer" bureaucracy that performs no useful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

To radically purge such a large number of people from the bureaucracy requires immense political power and the ability to seriously implement threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Bureaucrats are not easily dismissed due to their internal collaborations, networks, and legal protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Overcoming these obstacles to fundamentally change the system demands extreme political strength and a willingness to "shed blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The notion that such a purge could be achieved through a change of government within the legitimate order is deemed unrealistic, as the established order has strong internal balances that prevent radical steps by those constrained by laws and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Privatization and Decline of Public Service
The concept of privatization, particularly prominent in the 1980s with pioneers like Thatcher and Reagan, is described as a "robbery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. It involved selling off public service institutions like railways, hospitals, and post offices to private entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. These privatized ventures were largely unsuccessful, leading to a radical decline in public services while enriching a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. This shift eliminated the concept of public service, replacing it with the idea that every business must be profitable, irrespective of societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. This phenomenon, which resulted in universal impoverishment and the decline of [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western societies]] since the 1970s, is equated to "banditry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

## Cultural and Social Dynamics

### Political Polarization and Hatred
In Turkey, a phenomenon described as "political Alevism" has emerged, especially within the CHP (Republican People's Party), where a segment of the Alevi population uses Kemalism as a "swearing machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. This is seen as a reaction, a defense mechanism against insulting rhetoric and hostile government policy, particularly against the perceived dictatorship of Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. This polarization, where all sides resort to "blasphemy," is largely attributed to Tayyip Erdoğan's consistent spread of hatred on television for the last 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. This illustrates the deep divisions in [[cultural_and_societal_influences_in_history_and_modernday_politics | cultural and societal influences in history and modern-day politics]].

### Urban Transformations and Hatred of the Past
The construction of giant highways into cities, exemplified by projects like Vatan Caddesi in Istanbul, has been instrumental in dividing and fragmenting established urban fabrics and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>. This process was observed in Addis Ababa, where makeshift house labyrinths were replaced with skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:43">[01:51:43]</a>. Modernism, particularly in the 20th century's urban planning, art, and other aspects, was founded on a "hatred of the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>. Cities were divided and torn down, old works of art, architecture, customs, and traditions were discarded, reflecting a "rejection of the past, destruction of the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. It was only after the 1980s and 1990s that people realized the new cities were not livable, leading to the creation of theme parks and museum streets that preserve old textures as superficial attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>.

### Civil Unrest and Demographic Shifts
A sense of civil unrest is observed in the West, including Turkey, heading towards an inevitable and chaotic explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:20">[01:55:20]</a>. The primary drivers of this explosion are young people caught in a "vortex of hopelessness," particularly young men, who are sexually dissatisfied, morally ignorant, and introduced to drugs and alcohol at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. They have the power to tear apart society but are unlikely to direct it towards a reasonable political goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:12">[01:56:12]</a>.

Secondly, recent refugees and immigrants, especially in [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western countries]], particularly large African and Muslim segments in America, Latin Americans, and Indians, are seen as potentially powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>. These groups have little sympathy or partnership with [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western culture]] and are constantly humiliated as second-class citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:09">[01:58:09]</a>. Despite lacking institutional power, they possess the "brutal power of people who have nothing to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:29">[01:58:29]</a>.

### Islamic Influence in France
The Islamic religion has historically grown by establishing dominance even while being a minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. Muslims were a minority in lands that are now Turkey, likely until the 16th century or later, and were a minority but dominant in Harun Rashid's Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>. The question for France and Europe is not about Muslims forming a majority, but whether they can achieve dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, which is considered a very serious possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

While institutional, economic, legal, and state power in France are currently in the hands of the "old society," they are rapidly eroding due to demographic changes, lack of reproduction, loss of ideological self-confidence, and consequences of the democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. There is a strong possibility that immigrant minorities, who have not been institutionalized and operate illegally with flexibility and audacity, could quickly seize economic power during a major financial or economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. The novel *Submission* by French writer Michel Houellebecq is recommended for its fictional exploration of Muslims seizing power in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.

### Migration of Non-Muslim Communities in Istanbul
The migration of Istanbul's non-Muslim communities from centuries-old districts like Samatya and Kumkapı to Şişli began in the 1950s and became definitive by 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. This shift occurred as the non-Muslim middle class developed economically after crises and martial law (post-1945, especially during the Democrat Party period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. They migrated to the rapidly developing Şişli side, which saw the rise of apartment buildings following the Condominium Law in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

Additionally, a significant influx of proletarian migrants, particularly from Rumelia (Bulgaria and Yugoslavia), arrived in Istanbul during the Democrat Party period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. These migrants formed a poor working class that settled in the cheap, old neighborhoods of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. When these Rumelian immigrants began to "invade" Samatya and Kumkapı, the Armenian community living there fled to Şişli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. This illustrates the dynamic interplay of [[historical_perspective_on_civilizations_and_womens_roles | historical perspective on civilizations and women's roles]], [[impact_of_social_and_economic_transformations_on_humanity | impact of social and economic transformations on humanity]], and [[traditional_and_modern_societal_challenges | traditional and modern societal challenges]].

## Historical Perspectives and their Modern Relevance

### The Role of Ottoman Empire in Islamic History
The Turkish conquest in 1071 (often referred to as the Battle of Manzikert) is argued to have "brought Islam, which was a political phenomenon, back to its feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. From the 10th century, Islam had entered a period of rapid decline, losing military and political ground on its outer perimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43">[01:45:43]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire, after 300 years of productive chaos and turmoil following the Turkish conquest, brought a centralized and powerful administration to the entire Islamic geography (excluding India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:54">[01:46:54]</a>. This greatly contributed to the survival of Islam and its continued existence as a dominant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>. However, the Ottoman Empire simultaneously "emptied itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>. It led to the overall impoverishment of the Islamic world, causing it to lose dynamism, economic vitality, enthusiasm for production, and intellectual regression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:48:09]</a>. The Ottoman regime is likened to the Soviet Union, being extremely centralized and absorbing the surplus value of an entire region (Eastern Mediterranean) into the center and military, leaving behind a "dreg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire "rotted from within and crashed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

### The Collapse of the Soviet Union
The collapse of the Soviet Union was not solely due to its leaders being old and sick after Brezhnev; the "entire management team" had turned into a "gerontocracy" where "everyone was old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:23">[01:24:23]</a>. The system became completely deadlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Even a tougher military tyranny, as seen in Poland's Yaruzelsky period, would likely not have prevented the collapse, as the system had lost faith in itself, and citizens had no trust or faith in the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. The Soviet Union was in a state of exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. In contrast, China, facing a similar crisis, managed significant reforms without a regime rupture, suggesting that radical economic renewal was necessary for the Soviet Union to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

### Relevance of Roman History
The Western Roman Empire's inability to recover from barbarian invasions lasted for about 600 years (from 390s to 1000s AD), not 1000 years, before it began to recover after the year 1000, particularly towards the 1200s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. It's pointed out that if someone in 250 or 300 AD had suggested the collapse of Roman civilization, they would have been dismissed as an idiot, as it was considered a strong, developed, and civilized culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>. However, it collapsed "with a bang" and "very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>. This historical example is used to suggest that a similar rapid collapse is possible again, although one hopes it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. This reflects the cyclical nature of [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical and modern societal transformations]].

### Ethnicity and Identity
Ethnic affiliation is described as a matter of culture, customs, and self-identification, not biological lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>. The distinction between "us and others" in human communities is cultural and based on belief and self-attributed identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.

The origin of Eurasian Jews, particularly those who emerged as a large population in the Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania quadrangle, has been much debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a>. The probability of their biological lineage being related to ancient Middle Eastern Jews is considered very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>. While some ancient Jewish communities settled there, the people in question adopted Jewish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. The Khazar Turk theory suggests that a Turkish-origin ruling group decided to become Jewish, leading to a mixed society (including natives, Ural-Altay tribes, and some Germans) adopting Jewish culture and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. Despite most speaking a dialect of German in the 18th century, these Jews considered themselves Jerusalemites and part of the same nation as other Jews globally, a fact that cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. This demonstrates the [[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | cultural and historical perspectives on gender roles]] and broader identity formation.

## Overview of the Pınar Gültekin Case

Pınar Gültekin, described as a "beautiful-faced young woman," was the victim of a brutal murder in Muğla about two years prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The case garnered significant public attention and sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, sparking discussions around women's murders and women's rights, including the Istanbul Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

### Details from the Case File

The speaker had the opportunity to read the case file from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, noting that the incident as presented in the file was "completely different" from public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

According to the case file:
*   Pınar Gültekin was a student at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, with an active social life and a love for spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   The perpetrator, Cemal Metin Avcı, worked in the auto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   They met in a small bar in Muğla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> and had an intense, short-lived relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   Pınar requested money, and Cemal covered her rent and other expenses for about a year, totaling 500-1000 liras monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   When Cemal's business faced difficulties, he stated he could no longer provide money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   Pınar then allegedly threatened to expose their relationship to Cemal's family, including his gentle wife, if he didn't pay a specific amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. She reportedly called him 90 times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   Cemal paid around 20,000 liras in blackmail money over three to four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   The murder was planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, with details indicating Cemal thought about it days in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   He took her to a farmhouse and strangled her to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   After the murder, he tried to burn the body, and failing that, attempted to conceal it with concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

## Court Proceedings and Public Reaction

### The Court's Ruling

The court ruled on the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Premeditated murder in Turkish Criminal Law carries a penalty of aggravated life imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. However, if a crime is committed under the influence of "unjust provocation," the penalty can be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The court applied this "provocation discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, sentencing Cemal Metin Avcı to 23 years, which is close to the upper limit of the reduced penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He will serve 14.5 years in a closed prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

The court explicitly stated that burning the body was done *after* the murder, not as a means of torture during the killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Public and Media Response

For the first two years, "incalculable" fuss, propaganda, and false publications surrounded the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Common slogans included "they are killing our women" and "the court is a male court" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The "provocation discount" was heavily criticized, with many misinterpreting it as implying the victim's actions justified the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The speaker describes the "fuss" as a "witches' gang" aimed at deceiving and misleading the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

The speaker notes that people competed to swear at the killer and the judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, spreading the sentiment that "there is no law in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This public outcry occurred despite many people having no information about the case file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### The Court's Official Position

The 130-page court decision was praised by the speaker as "extraordinary," "clear," "consistent," written in proper Turkish, and free of spelling errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The court criticized lawyers for making "baseless and empty statements" that brought the issue to the media level rather than a legal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. It asserted that the court made the "most reasonable decision" based on conscience, law, and humanity, considering public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The speaker argues that people who "defend evil for the purpose of evil" are more immoral than those who commit murder out of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. He criticizes the media's intellectual level, stating that 99% of what is published in the press regarding such cases is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. He advises against judging criminal cases without personally examining the detailed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

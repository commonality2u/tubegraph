The historical and social dynamics of the Ardahan and Kars regions are complex, marked by significant demographic and cultural shifts over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The region's history is intertwined with Ottoman expansion, local Georgian principalities, and later Russian influence, leading to unique identity formations among its inhabitants. This also touches upon the broader topic of [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | ethnic and cultural changes in Eastern Anatolia over time]].

## The Term "Çinçavat"

The word "çinçavat" is a derogatory term used by Karapapakhs (Kemelir) to describe local Turks in the Ardahan and Kars regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This word is derived from Armenian, meaning "atheist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It signifies "corrupted faith" or "corrupted religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Intriguingly, "çinçavat" is also the name of a bridge in ancient Zoroastrian mythology, though an etymological connection between the two meanings is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The word's structure suggests "çinç" (weak or void) and "havad" (faith), implying "lacking faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Ottoman Conquest and Governance (16th-19th Centuries)

In the 16th century, after repeated defeats of the Iranian state, the Ottomans expanded their influence into this geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They encountered two Georgian kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. One prominent Georgian dynasty, the Jakeli, which had separated from the main Georgian kingdom in the 15th or late 14th century, governed a sovereignty area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This dynasty was strongly Christian and used the Georgian language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

After a 20-22 year war, the Jakeli dynasty was defeated by the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Following a policy of allowing local rulers in marginal regions to retain power if they converted to Islam, members of the Jakeli dynasty adopted Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They continued their rule in the Çıldır region, with one brother becoming Mahmut Pasha and another Süleyman Pasha, serving as Beylerbeyi and Sanjak beyimi of Çıldır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The Çıldır region, at that time, encompassed:
*   Today's Ardahan province entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Ahıska (Akhaltsikhe) and possibly Ahılkelek (Akhalkalaki) on the Georgian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The northernmost part of Kars, including a portion of Arpaçay district <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Oltu and Tortum districts northeast of Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Demographics and Cultural Landscape (1595)

An Ottoman census in 1595 provided a detailed record of the population in this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   All villages in Ardahan province, except for two, had a majority Georgian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   There were Armenians in some villages alongside Georgians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is relevant to [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian history and heritage in Turkey]].
*   Almost all names recorded were Georgian, and most villages had a church, indicating a predominantly Christian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Only 20 years after the Ottoman conquest, some villages had one or two Muslim households, but the vast majority remained Christian Orthodox Georgian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   While Oltu's population might have been Armenian but under Georgian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, Ardahan's village names (including hamlets, hills, fields, rivers) were almost entirely Georgian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, confirming it as a Georgian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

When the Georgian rulers converted to Islam, some of the local population also converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, many continued to be Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Churches, though abandoned by the early 1800s, remained largely intact, possibly serving as pilgrimage sites or shrines, suggesting a continued, albeit blended, religious identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Kipchak Turk Claims

There is no historical evidence or source record of Kipchak Turks in the Ardahan and Kars region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. While Georgian history mentions Kipchak warriors imported in the 12th century during wars against Mongols and Turks, there's no information on where they settled or if they remained in this specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Population Decline and Identity Crisis (1700s - 1800s)

Between the 1595 census and the tax records of the early 1700s, the region's population experienced a catastrophic decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This decline is attributed to poor governance and exploitation, rather than massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The Ottoman rule in these regions was an era of cruelty and poverty, leading to population depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

In 1801, Russia conquered the Georgian Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[01:00:00]</a>. Georgians living under Ottoman rule, who had partially converted to Islam, faced an identity dilemma: whether to align with the Georgian Kingdom (now under Russian control) or the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[01:00:00]</a>. This created a significant crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Around 1828, during the Ottoman-Russian War, some Georgians from the region migrated to the Russian side, while others remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[01:00:00]</a>. Those who stayed began to strongly assert a Turkish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[01:00:00]</a>. Even when Russians surveyed Ardahan 50 years later, they recorded the locals as Turks, not Georgians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[01:00:00]</a>.

Contemporary travelers (European, Georgian, Russian) noted that while these locals claimed to be Turks, their parents had Georgian names, and they preserved many Georgian customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[01:00:00]</a>. The speaker speculates that between 1801 and 1828, a psychological division occurred: some embraced Georgian identity and migrated, while others, having been under Turkish rule and partially Muslim for a long time, chose to identify as "Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[01:00:00]</a>. This "Turkish" identity was a political term, not a biological or lineage claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Karapapakhs and Local Turks

In addition to these Georgian-origin Turks, other Muslim Turks speaking a dialect close to Azerbaijani migrated from Russian territory to the emptied villages in Ardahan around 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[01:00:00]</a>. These are the Karapapakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[01:00:00]</a>. Both Karapapakhs and local Turks speak Turkish and are Muslim, but they harbor animosity towards each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[01:00:00]</a>. The Karapapakhs, who are the dominant majority in Çıldır and Arpaçay today, settled in emptied villages and called the local Georgian converts "çinçavat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[01:00:00]</a>.

The term "Ahıska Turks" was coined in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[01:00:00]</a>. The speaker considers it "normal standard nonsense of Turkists," noting that while Ahıska is a province, defining the Turks of that province ethnically is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Purpose of Education

Education's fundamental purpose is to mold, shape, and socialize the human child, enabling them to function within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Schools should focus on teaching three core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>:

1.  **Honor**: This is considered paramount, to the extent that one would rather die than lose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. Honor stands in opposition to self-interest and immediate pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. The education system should prioritize instilling this attitude of prioritizing honor over selfish gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. However, this is largely a forgotten art in contemporary education systems, especially in [[challenges_in_turkish_education_system | Turkey]] over the last 40-60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Instead, the system often glorifies dishonor and trickery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

2.  **Modesty**: While honor can lead to arrogance, modesty balances it by encouraging kindness and a willingness to extend a helping hand to others, even enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. Teaching the maturity to yield one's turn when necessary is a challenging, yet crucial, task for educators and schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.

3.  **Love of Science (Truth)**: This encompasses the desire to worship truth for its own sake, to expand its boundaries and horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. It also includes the love of technique, or practical science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

The speaker posits that if individuals are taught these three core principles, they will swiftly learn everything else necessary in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

## Historical Education Systems

### Ottoman Education System
The [[role_of_universities_and_education | Ottoman education system]] was perceived as weak and fragmented in many aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. However, nearly every town and many villages maintained a school with a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. These teachers, often bearded figures, would instruct children in basic Quranic knowledge, fundamental stories, and the common myths and narratives that formed societal knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

### Role of Madrasahs and Islamic Culture
The concept of "text within text" entered world literature through medieval Islamic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. [[Role of Universities and Education | Western and European universities]] adopted this approach from Islamic madrasahs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This involved accepting a single text and engaging in deep discussion, writing comments, footnotes, and even further footnotes on those notes by subsequent authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The basic texts of old madrasah education focused on problems of reason, mistakes, discussions, and critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Role of Religious Orders (Sects)
While official Sunni Islam, represented by the "Hodja and the Woman" (legal and educational system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>, provided a sophisticated, bookish, and rational system, it often fell short in meeting certain psychological needs of the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. Islam is described as a very geometric, rules-based, and rational religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

Religious orders (sects) emerged to fulfill these unmet needs, particularly the need for "magic" and charismatic religious expression through activities like music, dancing, and emotional excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. These sects complemented the perceived deficiencies of the rational Islamic religion, especially for the poor and ignorant, becoming important sources of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional Ottoman Elite attitude, which often looked down upon meeting the psychological needs of the ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

## Modern Day Challenges in Education
The current education system is largely seen as having collapsed globally, making it difficult to offer guidance to the younger generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. This generation is perceived as directionless, uneducated, ignorant, and helpless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

The desire of young people to become CEOs or wealthy through crypto exchanges immediately after graduation is viewed critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. Aiming to be a boss is seen as a better goal than seeking to be a civil servant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>, as bureaucracy implies a form of "slavery" from which one cannot easily escape after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. The inability to earn sufficient income through traditional employment often pushes people towards speculative ventures like crypto, which are likened to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

Historically, Armenians have adopted various religious traditions, each leaving a distinct mark on their culture and identity. The evolution of these practices, particularly the adoption of Christianity, profoundly shaped what it meant to be Armenian for centuries.

## Pre-Christian Religious Traditions

Before the widespread adoption of Christianity, Armenians adhered to a variety of religious beliefs:
*   **Ancient Gods and Paganism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>: This included ancient Armenian gods and pagan traditions.
*   **Iranian Traditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>: A set of religious traditions imposed around the 6th or 5th centuries BC.
*   **Urartian Pantheon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>: Before the Iranian period, there was a different set of gods and forms of worship.
*   **Greek Gods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>: In the 1st or 2nd century BC, during the time of King Tigranes the Great (Dikran), Armenians imported Greek gods, building new temples and bringing statues from Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. This was considered a serious policy around 80 BC, as part of an anti-Roman alliance with the Pontus King Mithridates to resist Roman expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Temples dedicated to Greek deities like Zeus, Apollo, and Hephaestus were built, particularly in the Erzincan region, the westernmost part of historic Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. Notably, by the time these temples were destroyed 350 years later, the Greek god names had been "Iranianized," with the Temple of Zeus, for example, being referred to as the Temple of Hormuz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Conversion to Christianity and the Armenian Church

The arrival of Christianity in Armenia, around the beginning of the 3rd or 4th century, is described as a "striking process" and a "reaction" against Western cultural imperialism, choosing Eastern cultural influence instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Forcible Conversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>: The conversion to Christianity, under Iranian cultural influence, involved a "very bloody and difficult internal struggle" that forced the king to accept the new religion brought by an "enlightening" figure from Kayseri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.
*   **Destruction and Seizure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>: Christian converts systematically destroyed pagan temples, killed priests, and seized the vast properties belonging to these temples—including lands, villages, and towns—in the name of the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The administrator of the church quickly became the largest property owner in Armenia, for example, controlling almost all of Erzincan province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
*   **Synonymous with Armenian Identity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>: From the 4th century onwards, being Christian became synonymous with being Armenian for centuries. The Armenian Church severed ties with the broader Greek/Universal Orthodox church, adopting a distinct sect unique to Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Until the 19th century, membership in this church, its culture, traditions, and ceremonies, was the essence of being Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

## Impact of Religious Conversions and Cultural Shifts

### Loss of Identity Through Conversion
For centuries, if an Armenian left the Armenian Church, they were no longer considered Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This often meant becoming Turkish. This phenomenon is explained by the education system of the time:
*   **Religious Education** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>: Until the 19th century, the entire education system in the Ottoman Empire was religious. Children attended schools based on their sect (mosque, church, synagogue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **[[language_and_cultural_changes_among_ottoman_armenians | Language and cultural changes among Ottoman Armenians]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>: A child leaving the Armenian community and religion would automatically attend a Muslim school, where they would learn Arabic script and Turkish, the spoken language of the country. Within a generation, these children would grow up without learning Armenian at an official level, adopting Turkish and Arabic as their cultural languages. Their minds would be quickly "erased" of any past connection to the Armenian community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

### Reactions to the Armenian Church
From the mid-18th century, with the influence of European modernity, the Armenian Church faced a serious crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Seeking Alternatives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>: Some Armenians, disturbed by the "bigotry" and "exploitation system" of the Armenian Church, reacted by converting to Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Becoming Catholic was a way to protest the contemporary domination of the Armenian Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Later, Protestantism emerged as an even more radical break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **New "Nations"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>: By converting, these individuals were no longer considered Armenians in the traditional sense; "Armenian Catholic" and "Armenian Protestant" became distinct "nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   **Conversion to Islam** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>: In Eastern Anatolia, particularly among the poorest and most remote Armenian villagers, large numbers converted to Islam, often finding an outlet for their long-developed "hostility" towards the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. This was fueled by the Church's perceived inadequacy in protecting them from Kurdish attacks despite collected taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. This resulted in a "radical decrease" in Armenian populations in regions like Bahçesaray and Gevaş from the 1840s to 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. These conversions were accompanied by deep hostility, leading to later destruction of Armenian churches and killing of priests, often by those who were themselves Armenians just one generation prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

### Redefining Armenian Identity in the 19th Century
In the latter half of the 19th century (post-1860s and 1870s), intellectuals in Istanbul and Tbilisi began efforts to define Armenian identity on a new basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. This involved seeking a common identity that could unite Armenian Orthodox, Catholics, and Protestants on a shared platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. This highlights a shift from a purely religious definition to a more national or cultural one.

## Contemporary Interpretations of Religion

The discussion on religious practices also touches on modern interpretations of Christianity and Islam:
*   **Christianity as Moral Stance/Tradition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>: Western Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism) has successfully adapted by interpreting Christianity as a moral stance, family tradition, and social custom rather than just rules and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. Mediterranean and Eastern European Christians, including Greeks, Serbs, Russians, and Armenians, have adopted a similar approach, turning Christianity into a family tradition and a web of life, with less emphasis on strict rules or theological specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Flexibility of Holy Books** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>: Holy books and religious traditions are seen as "infinitely flexible," capable of adapting to diverse human needs and value systems throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

### The Ur(u)ms: A Case of Evolving Identity
The Ur(u)ms, or Urums, are a group predominantly living in Georgia and Russia (extinct in Armenia) who are members of the Greek Orthodox Church but speak only Turkish, specifically with a heavy Erzurum accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>. Their origins are speculated to involve Turks converting to Christianity and migrating to Russia during the 1828-1829 war, seizing an opportunity for a "better life" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>. The discovery of Turkish family names like "Mahmutoğlu" in their cemeteries suggests a past connection to a Muslim Turkish identity, highlighting the complex [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | impact of historical migrations and cultural changes in Anatolia]] on religious and ethnic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.

## Historical Conflict and Reconciliation

The historical role of religious groups and ethnic identities is also discussed in the context of conflict, especially related to [[historical_context_of_armenian_genocide | Armenian genocide]] and [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | History of Armenian and Turkish relations]]:
*   **Kurdish Role in Armenian Suffering** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>: Prior to 1915, the "real tyrant" of Armenians and the primary cause for their fleeing their homeland was the Kurdish element, specializing in violence, property usurpation, and destruction of churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. Armenians often sought protection from the Ottoman state against Kurdish attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:43">[01:35:43]</a>.
*   **1915 Annihilation Project** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>: The 1915 events are described as a "project of annihilation" consciously executed by the Turkish state bureaucracy, which used Kurdish lords and people as "allies and helpers and subcontractors" due to their existing tradition of violence and extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. This was done by assuring them the state would not prosecute them for their crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>.
*   **Shift in Kurdish Attitudes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>: The attitude of Kurds towards the Armenian issue has "radically changed" in the last 20-30 years, which is seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>. The speaker hopes Turks can also overcome their prejudices and ignorance like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

These historical religious practices, particularly the centuries-long intertwining of Armenian identity with the Armenian Church, continue to shape the cultural and social fabric of Armenian communities, even amidst modern challenges and evolving interpretations of faith.

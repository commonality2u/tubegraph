Yugoslavia's political history is characterized by a complex interplay of internal governance, societal transformation, and intricate geopolitical maneuvering, particularly concerning its relationship with major global powers.

## The Era of Tito (1945-1980)

Josip Broz Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia, is described as a dictator who oversaw a "terrible police regime" [02:37:00]. This period was marked by significant oppression of those who thought differently or attempted to protect their individuality against authority [02:40:07]. People were imprisoned, tortured, and even killed under this regime [02:41:14]. Societal segments, such as those suspicious of the government's stance during World War I, and Macedonians in the south, lived under heavy police pressure [02:42:27].

Upon Tito's death, the people of Yugoslavia reportedly felt a collective sigh of relief, experiencing a sense of liberation [02:48:58]. Discussions with various ethnic groups in Yugoslavia immediately following Tito's death, including Albanians, Muslims, Bosnians, Serbians, and Slovenes, revealed no positive opinions about his rule [02:50:53]. This widespread sentiment was likened to the celebrations across the Ottoman Empire after Sultan Abdulhamid's death, indicating a prevalent feeling of "Enough is enough" [02:54:19].

### Achievements Under Tito

Despite the repressive aspects, Tito's era is credited with two significant achievements when viewed in [[historical_perspectives_on_the_balkans_and_its_impact_on_modern_politics | historical perspective]]:
*   **State Formation**: Tito succeeded in establishing a "great and powerful state" in a challenging geographical region comprised of diverse, dissimilar entities [02:59:16]. This was considered a notable accomplishment [02:59:16].
*   **Creation of a Middle Class**: In a predominantly peasant society with hardly any urban middle class, Tito's regime made substantial efforts to foster one [02:59:50]. Like other communist regimes in Eastern Europe and Russia, Yugoslavia successfully created a literate, educated middle class of at least middle or high school graduates [03:07:08]. This new class was capable of practicing modern professions, living in decent housing, and earning sufficient income [03:27:08]. This development of an urban class based on education and profession, rather than capitalism, is considered the "greatest project and the greatest achievement of the communist regime" [03:28:00].

Prior to the communist era, the social structure of these countries, influenced by long Ottoman rule, largely consisted of a peasant class, a small class of tradesmen (often Turkish or Greek), and a clergy-priest and Bey class, with no significant middle class [02:30:23]. Professions like doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, teachers, and journalists emerged during the communist regime [02:31:00]. The continued existence of the seven republics formed from Yugoslavia's disintegration is attributed to this class [02:31:00].

### Relations with the Soviet Union

The strategic reason behind Yugoslavia's eventual split from the Soviet Union revolved around preventing Russia's access to the Mediterranean Sea [03:09:00]. Historically, Western states had concerns about Serbia becoming a Russian satellite as early as the mid-1800s, implementing measures to prevent Russia from reaching the Mediterranean [03:11:00]. This led to the creation of Montenegro as a separate kingdom, denying Serbia access to crucial ports like Kotor and Tivat [03:12:00].

In 1945, Russian submarines were stationed at the Tivat Naval Base [03:33:40]. However, the first action taken during Yugoslavia's fallout with the Soviet Union was the closure of this naval base [03:42:22]. This decision was likely influenced by Western states, particularly the United States and England, to prevent Stalin from maintaining a naval presence in Tivat [03:44:00]. Yugoslavia, being situated between two major military powers and having suffered heavily in both World Wars, found it necessary to navigate relations with both sides, maintaining its internal communist order while complying with Western demands externally [03:55:24].

## Dissolution of Yugoslavia (1991)

Yugoslavia officially disintegrated in 1991 [03:59:00]. After the [[historical_perspectives_on_the_bosnian_war | Bosnian War]] concluded around 1994 or 1995, Montenegro and Serbia continued as a union until 2006 [03:59:59]. Montenegro's separation from Serbia was largely due to strong pressure from Germany and the European Union, sweetened with promises of EU membership [03:00:30]. This continued the historical pattern of Western and European powers preventing Serbia's access to the sea [03:00:41].

Montenegro, described as a "completely artificial country," was encouraged to declare independence [03:07:08]. Efforts were also made through symbolic events and diplomatic maneuvers to disrupt its relations with Serbia [03:07:08]. Most recently, a large NATO military base was reportedly under construction near Nikšić in Montenegro [03:49:00]. This strategic location is intended to serve as a choke point, preventing Serbia and its allies from descending to the Gulf of Kotor and Tivat in a potential major conflict [03:57:00].

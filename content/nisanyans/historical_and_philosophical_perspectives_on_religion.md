From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Discussions surrounding religion often elicit strong, negative reactions from diametrically opposed viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Some question the connection between reason and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, while others, reflecting a typical enlightenment philosophy, assert that reason and religion are inherently opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, this perspective itself can be problematic, as claiming reason's independence from religion can turn reason into another subject of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Many individuals who have made significant contributions to human history, including those considered highly rational and open-minded, have held deep religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Such beliefs, like in Allah, angels, or the virgin birth, should be accepted as data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is important to acknowledge that people may find religious narratives attractive or normal, especially when other social options are not readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Even when non-belief becomes a social option, people demonstrably continue to believe in religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This persistence is evident in places like the Soviet Union, where compulsory anti-religious propaganda for 80 years inadvertently led many to conclude that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## The Phenomenon of Religion

The persistence of religion, even with advancements in science, is a notable phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Rational individuals must confront this reality by seriously explaining and understanding why and how religion remains a persistent force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Ignoring or belittling religion is not an option for those representing rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Instead, they must understand, embrace, and confront it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

The goal is to understand religion on a rational basis, discuss its boundaries, and determine its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This approach is considered crucial for [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Turkey]]'s current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The speaker envisions a permanent institution, possibly a new kind of "Faculty of Theology," focused on bringing a rational approach to religion, distinct from vocational Islamic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Rational Thought and Its Application to Religion

Rational thought is defined as a specific way of thinking and facing truth, seen as the basic engine of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Humanity constantly faces overwhelming data and incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. To cope, humans put forth assumptions (hypotheses) and test them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

This process involves:
1.  **Formulating Hypotheses:** Proposing explanations for observed phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
2.  **Testing Assumptions:** Confronting hypotheses with contradictory results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
3.  **Refinement or Rejection:** If results contradict, the theory is refined or discarded for a more accurate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

This approach, based on falsifiable assumptions, is the way of learning and the way of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Applying this to religion means discussing it rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This could involve:
*   Attracting religiosity with rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Confining religiosity within rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   Determining mutual boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Accepting religiosity as a principle and systematically analyzing its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

One example is examining Islamic beliefs about its origins through a rational, historical, and ideological lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Religious explanations, such as divine intervention for the Quran's writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, can be accepted as hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> or seriously engaged with and potentially falsified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## The Evolution of Religion

Religion, in its early stages, can be seen as a form of "scientific activity" â€“ proposing hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. For instance, attributing people getting lost in a forest to "Jinn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. These "scientific hypotheses" do not have to be true, but they must be falsifiable and explain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Early sacred texts, like the Torah, contain what could be considered scientific efforts to explain the world's creation, such as the separation of earth and sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

A significant turning point in this evolution is [[historical_narratives_and_philosophical_discussions_on_religious_events | Judaism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Unlike Greek mythology where gods operate in a detached, mythological field, the Jewish God interacts directly with the world, wrestling and directing history with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Questioning this God and His stories becomes politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

This leads to a stage where the idea of God becomes increasingly abstract, incomprehensible, and unfalsifiable by any real-world evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. For the God of the Quran or the Bible, there's an answer for every question, rendering the divine concept immune to falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## Faith vs. Reason

A key distinction between faith and scientific understanding is the emphasis on belief without empirical proof. For instance, the story of Thomas doubting Jesus's resurrection highlights that true belief is valued even *without* tangible evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. The doctrine of [[historical_narratives_and_philosophical_discussions_on_religious_events | Christian]] belief, as articulated by thinkers like Tertullian, asserts "I believe because it is absurd," signifying that faith is distinct from, and even transcends, reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Definition of Faith
> Faith, by definition, is based on a reasoning style that is not dependent on falsifiable hypotheses or things that can be proven otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. The core principle of faith is "if it exists, it is faith; if it doesn't exist, it is not faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

This leads to a point where faith and reason cannot meet on any ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. While rational thought thrives on challenging theses and welcoming counter-arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>, faith operates as a closed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. For example, despite rational arguments about the economic and biological benefits of pork, the religious argument for not eating it ultimately boils down to "because I believe this; I am not obliged to question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Addressing Religion in Modern Contexts

For non-religious people in [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Turkey]] since the 20th century, common approaches to religion have been dismissal or aggressive opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This has left religion largely to the monopoly of religious individuals, leaving rationalists ill-equipped to engage in meaningful discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. When dissenting opinions on religion face threats, and religious approaches influence political and cultural life, it necessitates intelligent engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

The objective is not to destroy a believer's religiosity, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on reinforcing non-religious individuals and those undecided about their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The ultimate aim is to "surround religion with reason" and ensure that reason acts as the referee in the discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Historical Cases and Interpretations

Analyzing the origins of holy books like the Torah, Bible, and Quran through a philological and rational lens is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. An example involves the Quran's mention of Mary, described as the daughter of Imran and sister of Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. In the Torah, Moses's sister is Mary (Miriam), and his brother is Aaron, their father being Amram (Imran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

A rational interpretation suggests that the Quran's writer likely confused Mary, mother of Jesus, with Mary, sister of Moses, given the shared names and familial connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. While alternative hypotheses (e.g., another Imran or Harun) are possible, they require strong evidence to be convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

During Muhammad's time, Jewish and Christian communities were present and familiar with their scriptures in the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. While Muhammad likely did not read these texts himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>, he would have gained knowledge by hearsay from his neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. It is "quite natural for Muhammad to say some things wrong" in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. The fact that later redactors of the Quran did not correct such apparent inconsistencies, despite ample opportunity, is also a point for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The aim is to engage with religion without dismissing it as worthless nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. This means finding ways to "embrace religion through reason" and explaining religious data in a more rational, common-sense manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This includes exploring [[philosophical_discussions_on_morality_and_belief | the position of religion within Human Rights Law]] and the limits of freedom of expression in religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

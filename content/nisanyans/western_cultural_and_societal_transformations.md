Western culture and society have undergone significant transformations over centuries, evolving from periods of perceived superiority to a more hesitant and doubt-ridden modern era. These changes encompass shifts in governance, social structures, educational philosophies, and responses to global events like pandemics.

## Historical Superiority and Modern Hesitation

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Western society manifested a strong sense of superiority and arrogance, believing itself extraordinarily advanced with "no one in history superior to us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This sentiment was evident during the Renaissance and intensified through the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading up to World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Europe positioned itself as the "Superior Club," pioneering and leading humanity in many areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

In contrast, the modern age exhibits a less robust display of Western dominance, characterized by greater hesitancy and self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Post-World War II Societal Shifts

Following World War II, major [[Impact of social and economic transformations on humanity | societal and economic transformations]] reshaped Europe:
*   **Liquidation of Ruling Classes** The traditional aristocracy and wealthy elites were significantly diminished, partly through heavy taxation, including inheritance taxes reaching 90-100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Rise of the Social State** The concept of a "social state" gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Widespread University Education** There was a concerted effort to provide widespread university education to the entire society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This aimed to shift power and authority from property owners to an educated class, leading to the creation of a large middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Regulation and Algorithms** A new mentality emerged, focusing on managing society "better and more perfectly" through algorithms and detailed regulations. Examples include setting precise distances between tables in restaurants, licensing fishermen, and standardizing the weight of forks and knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This approach aimed to regulate society using "statistical or administrative models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

### Consequences of Bureaucracy

This drive for extensive regulation, while intended to improve management, has been criticized for leading to an "exhausted civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Europe, once a continent producing "almost everything" new and striking for 500 years, transformed into a "bureaucratic nightmare" governed by algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The adventurous spirit of earlier centuries, which allowed for endeavors like plundering India without concern for licenses or health services, has been replaced by a system where such actions would directly lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Modern Culture and Social Engineering

The modern Western worldview prioritizes the regulation of society through strict rules and prohibitions, effectively making "police" (in a broad sense) the sole concern of European culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The contemporary education system is seen as contributing to this by raising specialized bureaucrats who prioritize converting orders into algorithms rather than questioning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This results in a society that is "devoid of original ideas" and "lacking leadership ability," a perceived "conscious decision" of "social engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

### Pandemic Response and Constitutional Violations

The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic exemplified this transformation, with many countries, including those in the West, violating their own constitutions by restricting individual rights through government decrees rather than legal procedures or declared states of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This widespread, consistent action across 82 countries suggests a "single center" of command, as similar norms and standards are often adopted globally in various sectors (e.g., health rules, lightbulb wattage, tire manufacturing, Christmas candy standards), frequently originating from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.

The mask mandate, in particular, is viewed not as a scientific health measure, but as a psychological tool to instill fear and enforce obedience to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. The widespread adoption of masks, even when their effectiveness against viruses is questioned, highlights a societal tendency to conform to authority, with individuals gaining satisfaction from enforcing rules on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

The private sector's role in vaccine development, funded by public taxes and heavily advertised by states, is described as a "big fraud" and a "robbery operation" to transfer public money to pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. The dismissal of Russia's early vaccine announcement by Western media further indicates that the true objective of the pandemic response was not public health but rather a different agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.

## Systemic Racism in Western Societies

The existence of systemic racism is debated, particularly in the United States. While elite and middle-class black individuals may experience equality or even privilege, lower classes often face significant discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. The disproportionately high number of black individuals in American prisons (50-72% of the prison population) points to a complex issue, raising questions about whether it's due to higher crime rates or systemic oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.

In contrast, Portugal offers a different model, with a history of encouraging mixed marriages and integrating people from former colonies into society and the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>. This has led to a lower perception of discrimination against its African population compared to the Anglo-Saxon experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

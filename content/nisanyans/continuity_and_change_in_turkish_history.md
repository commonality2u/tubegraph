The 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic was anticipated to be marked by grand ceremonies and enthusiastic celebrations, with expectations of significant political events, such as the declaration of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. However, these expectations were largely unmet, and the government seemingly aimed to make the centennial an "ordinary and unimportant event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. While a small group attempted to generate excitement through demonstrations and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, it was evident that the 100th anniversary did not hold much significance for the country as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Historical Perspective: Continuity as an Overarching Theme

From a broad historical perspective, the Republic of Turkey is viewed as an "episode" within a continuous historical process that began at least by 1453, if not earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Comparative Historical Examples
Despite significant political transformations, historical continuities often outweigh differences in other nations:
*   **France**: Transitioned from a monarchy to a republic through major struggles, yet it remains France, with continuities outweighing differences between monarchical and republican periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   [[Cultural and political transformations in Turkey and its periphery | Russia]]: Experienced centuries of monarchy, then revolutions leading to different regimes, yet Russia's fundamental identity persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **China**: Maintained its state identity for 2000 years, transforming into a republic in the 20th century in line with contemporary trends, but remaining China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Continuity in Turkey
Similar to these examples, the Turkish Republic is seen as a period within [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | Turkey's general history]], akin to the Abdulhamid period or periods of rise, stagnation, and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

Key aspects of continuity include:
*   **National Identity**: The country's name among foreigners has consistently been Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. While the Ottoman Empire didn't have a specific name, often referred to as the "World Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:12]</a>, "Türkiye" was the common external designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **State Narrative**: The state's self-perception and historical narrative show a clear continuity, linking figures like Fatih, Yavuz, Abdulhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **Institutions**: Institutions like the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police Organization, land registry, mapping directorate, and population administration demonstrate an obvious continuity, with their foundational anniversaries celebrated for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. The state's institutional ideology and self-perception also show continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Revision of the Ottoman State**: The Republic of Turkey can be seen as a revised version of the Ottoman State, adapted to new age conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **The People**: The collective identity of the people has not fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
    *   Previously identified as "Muslims," this largely overlapped with those later termed "Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
    *   Ottoman Muslims (excluding Arabs) were consistently referred to as "Turks" by their neighbors and foreign observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
    *   The "Turk" in this context refers to the people defining the Ottoman state's infrastructure, not Central Asian Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
*   **Ruling Cadres**: The Republic largely comprised the continuation of the ruling cadres of the old state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Elite school graduates and military commanders of the old regime established the new one, maintaining state continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Laws**: Ottoman laws, which began radical reform and rewriting based on European models in the 1840s (e.g., Commercial, Criminal, Civil Procedure, Penal Codes), showed obvious continuity into the Republican era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **Debts and Traditions**: The Republic of Turkey assumed the debts of the Ottoman State, and many Ottoman traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Language**: Turkish remained the dominant language, with significant reforms in usage style from the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## Significant Changes with the Republic

Despite the continuities, there were notable changes:

1.  **Transformation of the Sovereign Nation Concept**: The most significant change, impacting society radically, was the shift of the [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_Turkey | Muslim or Turkish segment]] from being a "Sovereign Nation" in a multi-ethnic Ottoman order to aiming for a single nation-state model during the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
    *   This process, which began in the 19th century with the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, aimed at eliminating non-Muslim elements from the Anatolian and Rumelian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
    *   It reached radical solutions just before the Republic and continued through the Republican period until the 1980s, fundamentally altering the country's sociological structure and state ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

2.  **Expansion of the Bureaucratic Cadres**: A second major change was the significant increase in the size and diversification of the bureaucratic staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.
    *   This was a global trend in the 20th century, not unique to Turkey or republics, as seen in monarchies like Iran and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
    *   After a period of stagnation under Abdulhamid and subsequent wars (1908-1923), the number of literate individuals included in state cadres grew from approximately 10,000 to 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
    *   This led to a quantitative increase in education, though with a serious decrease in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.
    *   These new cadres, drawn from various societal segments, became strong supporters of the Republic, viewing it as their "savior" for providing them opportunities in state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. This phenomenon is independent of the specific regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>.

3.  **Revolutionary Excitement and Idealism**: In the 1920s and 30s, [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkey]]'s administrative cadres were swept up in a "great revolutionary excitement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
    *   This stemmed from the collapse of the old regime, instilling a desire to "open a clean page" and succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.
    *   This global sentiment after World War I advocated for dismantling old institutions and rebuilding on rational foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.
    *   A "tremendous idealism" and revolutionary enthusiasm characterized circles close to the regime until the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.
    *   However, the end result was largely "disappointment" and "much talk and little action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>. The reforms were superficial, and the administrative cadres were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. Many founders acquired wealth through the elimination of non-Muslims and focused on protecting their gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.
    *   The dynamism imported from the West and Soviet Union by Mustafa Kemal Pasha and a small core group was not fully embraced by the wider founding generation, who reverted to traditional thinking after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.

4.  **Change in Head of State Election Method**: The specific and different aspect of the Republic is the change in the method of electing the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>.
    *   Historically, a strong, hereditary leader was seen as essential for governing large states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>.
    *   However, this model collapsed globally after World War I, with monarchies in [[Cultural and political transformations in Turkey and its periphery | Russia]], Germany, Austria-Hungary, and China falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
    *   The "fashion of the age" or necessity led to the principle that elites, with some public approval, could elect the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>.
    *   While republics ideally tie administration changes to a system (e.g., term limits), this didn't consistently happen in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>.
    *   Ultimately, the real-world results of this change in management technique are not seen as significantly different in terms of societal development (e.g., child mortality, life span, literacy, urbanization, economic growth), as similar advancements occurred in monarchies like Iran, Jordan, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. These developments are attributed to the "era" itself, including new state understandings, increased state influence, and advancements in transportation, communication, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The establishment of the Turkish Republic was an important historical event, opening a new chapter in the [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | history of the Turkish state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. The most significant changes were the transformation of the Turks from a "Sovereign Nation" to a single nation and the expansion of educated public cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. However, the speaker argues that the existence of a republican regime itself did not fundamentally alter these processes, as they would have occurred regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the 1920s and 30s, though significant for a narrow segment, ultimately failed to bring about the intended radical societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:00">[49:24:00]</a>. Therefore, attempts to present the Republic's centennial as a "very important turning point" or a matter of "existence and non-existence" are not considered serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>.

## Ankara as Capital: Not from Scratch

Ankara, chosen as the capital, was not built "from nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>. In the early 20th century, it was one of Central Anatolia's largest and most developed cities, comparable to Kayseri and Konya, with a population around 40,000-50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. It is an ancient city, significant since the Roman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>. Ankara was economically prosperous, especially due to its near-monopoly on mohair exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:04:00">[53:04:00]</a>, and its development was boosted by the arrival of the Anatolian railway in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>.

Examples of cities founded from scratch include Saint Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>, and historically, many Chinese capitals, Istanbul (founded by Constantine in 325 AD), and Elazığ (founded as a military garrison in 1860) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:44:00">[54:44:00]</a>.

## The Turkish War of Independence (1919-1922)

The defeat of Greece in the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1922) is not considered an exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:33:00">[57:33:00]</a>. Given Turkey's population (four times that of Greece) and economy (three to four times larger) at the time, and its centuries-old military tradition compared to Greece's nascent one, Turkey was expected to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:30:00">[58:30:00]</a>.

The real "trick" in the war was the involvement of Britain, which drove the Greeks into the field, despite allied support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>. The Turkish side's concern was how far British support would go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>. The situation is compared to the current Ukraine War, where Ukraine's ability to resist Russia depends on Western support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Britain abandoned Greece when success seemed unlikely, refusing further military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

Mustafa Kemal Pasha's political calculations were key in transforming the war into a national epic of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. He presented the Battle of the Commander-in-Chief as a personal success, laying the foundation for his political future and eventual dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. Thus, August 30, 1922, was strongly emphasized as a great national epic for political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

### Gallipoli Campaign
The British and French allied navy's attempt to cross the Dardanelles in March 1915 failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Their subsequent land forces landing on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915 was a "crazy project" born of arrogance, Winston Churchill's idea, and it ended in failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Their aim was to capture Istanbul quickly to remove the Ottoman Empire from the war, and also to prevent Russia from potentially taking Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. Landing in Izmir was not a viable alternative as it would require a massive army for a long march to Istanbul, which they did not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.

## Historical and Cultural Context

### Cyrillic Alphabet
The Cyrillic alphabet, used by Russians, Serbs, Bulgarians, and other former Soviet communities, was created by two Byzantine Greek brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, from Thessaloniki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. In the 9th century, they developed an alphabet for the Slavic language, primarily based on the Greek alphabet, with some letters borrowed from Hebrew to represent sounds not found in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. Initially used in the Great Moravian Kingdom, it spread to Bulgaria when the Moravians were absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. This development of new alphabets and writing systems was a global trend in the 8th and 9th centuries, seen in Anglo-Saxons, Scandinavians, and Turks (Orkhon Inscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

### Public Discourse and Social Media
The rise of social media and the internet has led to increased rudeness in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. Without the immediate consequences of face-to-face interaction, people feel free to insult and dismiss others, reducing the general quality of public discourse and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>.

### Freedom of Expression in Turkey
Freedom of expression in [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkey]] is very restricted, not just concerning insulting the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. There are absurdly narrow and bigoted restrictions regarding religion, leading to easy trouble for spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. Additionally, strong political control exists in the media, and legal standards are lower than in the West, limiting critical expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

## Turkey in the 1990s

The 1990s in [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkey]] were a complex period. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the Özal movement fostered a sense of liberalism (though loosely defined), encouraging a focus on wealth accumulation, enjoyment, and less adherence to traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This period saw rapid global integration, easier international travel, and an optimistic outlook about Turkey's integration with the West and joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. There was a sense that freedom of press and expression were expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

However, this optimism gradually gave way to pessimism by the mid-90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>. The Kurdish issue escalated significantly around 1993, leading to a terror campaign, deportation policies, destruction of thousands of villages, and forced migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. Kurdish writers and thinkers were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. The military, which had been withdrawing from politics, re-entered with tyranny and oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. This dark period continued to worsen, culminating in the explosion of the existing political party system around 2000, from which the Justice and Development Party emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>. The 1990s are summarized as "not a good period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

## Interest in Niche Historical Areas

Public interest in seemingly niche historical topics, such as 19th-century migrations, stems from a deeper societal need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>. The standard official discourses about Turkey's past and identity are perceived as "stupid lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. People feel a gap between what they learn in school and what they hear from their elders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>. There is a desire to reconcile these contradictions and understand the true, complex historical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

The official ideology imposed on Turkey denies the rich tapestry of ethnic and cultural divisions, clashes, and envies across its regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. The education curriculum and national ideology try to force a "stupid narrative" or myth that denies these realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. Discovering the real, local histories, even at a tiny level, and exposing the inadequacies of the official narrative is seen as a "revolutionary service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

## Outlook on Geopolitics

There is a serious danger of war in the current global climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>. Iran, for example, is seen as potentially being forced into war and likely to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>. [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | Turkey]] is aware of this threat and likely wishes to avoid involvement, sending mixed signals to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>. Turkey's approach is to maintain a friendly facade towards all parties, aiming to stay out of conflicts and perhaps play a role as a guarantor or supporter in any future Palestinian order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. However, this is seen as difficult to achieve due to potential rejection from the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

## The Challenge of Truth in Contemporary Narratives

The speaker begins by noting the difficulty of analyzing events like the Moscow incident, stating that the widely accepted viewpoint of hostility is not entirely convincing for an operation of that magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. Instead, the incident is seen as a link in a chain of provocations, designed to force Russia into an aggressive reaction and escalate the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>. This deliberate escalation aims to make Russia react disproportionately, potentially destroying Kyiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:18">[03:08:18]</a>. Past provocations, such as civilian bombings in Belgorod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>, attempts to demolish the Crimean Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:19">[03:48:19]</a>, and apartment bombings in Moscow by drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:57">[03:53:57]</a>, are cited as examples of actions without military purpose, aimed at provoking an emotional Russian response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:24">[04:22:24]</a>.

The speaker questions who truly desires this escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:08">[04:27:08]</a>. The official stance of Western countries, including the American and Western European alliance, is seen as not aligning with this goal, as they reportedly understand the Ukraine War is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:07">[04:48:07]</a>. The war, according to the speaker, has been over for over a year, with no way for Ukraine to win, and Western involvement has not yielded desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>. The West's primary fear is a sudden and massive Russian attack on the Ukrainian front, occupying Kyiv, which would be a disaster for the Western alliance due to their significant financial, monetary, and diplomatic investments in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:29">[05:43:29]</a>. Such an outcome would severely damage NATO's credibility and functionality, leading allied nations to question America's power and review their foreign policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:03">[06:54:03]</a>.

The West's strategy for over a year has been to intimidate Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:16">[08:17:16]</a>. The widely announced Ukrainian counter-attack in the summer of 2023 was a bluff to deter a major Russian offensive and encourage Russia to strengthen its defensive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:04">[08:37:04]</a>. Similarly, recent statements from Western spokespeople about preparing for a "Great World War" are not real planning but bluffs to deter a major Russian attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:04">[09:55:04]</a>. The speaker argues that the Western world does not want war because it knows it will lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:14">[10:14:14]</a>.

The concept of the collapse of the Western alliance, akin to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, is discussed as a potential risk for all countries, including Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:03">[11:44:03]</a>. Therefore, the Western alliance's expectation is for the war to drag on without serious incidents, allowing public interest to wane so that Ukraine's eventual defeat goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:13">[12:05:13]</a>. Russia, understanding this logic, does not want to launch a sudden, major attack that would collapse Ukraine, despite its military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:14">[12:53:14]</a>.

The speaker highlights a contradiction: while Western leaders publicly try to deter Russia from a major attack by claiming they are "crazy and angry" enough to start a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:08">[14:05:08]</a>, other actors or "powers that even they cannot manage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:43">[14:29:43]</a> are actively encouraging Russia into aggressive policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:08">[14:43:08]</a>. These instigators could be state institutions, adventurous elements within them, or even one or more Western alliance states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:05">[14:54:05]</a>. Armed and military forces within Ukraine with differing views on policy, including "massacre tourism" by Western militia forces, could also be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:15">[16:05:15]</a>. These groups, sometimes described as "volunteer Akıncıs" rather than mercenaries, operate with varying degrees of independence from Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:23">[16:53:23]</a>.

## The Manufacturing of "Truth" and Public Deception

The speaker dismisses the blaming of ISIS for the Moscow attack as ridiculous and absurd, noting that Western governments quickly and unanimously pushed this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:04">[19:10:04]</a>. This behavior is linked to a pattern of "nonsense theories" and propaganda used to confuse the public and prevent rational thought, especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Gaza War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:36">[20:04:36]</a>.

> "The effect of these is not to be convincing, but to destroy the public's ability to think rationally, that is, they hit from the right, then from the left, and tell another lie. Without covering up that lie, they throw another lie out there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:29">[20:48:29]</a>

This tactic of continuously disseminating unbelievable and absurd lies is not meant for belief but to confuse the mind and prevent rational discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:03">[22:05:03]</a>.

## Loyalty to Truth: A Difficult Pursuit

The speaker discusses the concept of "loyalty to the truth" as observed in a book about Ottoman Grand Viziers, describing it as an "extraordinary work" due to its adherence to truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:27">[54:00:27]</a>.

**Attributes of Loyalty to Truth:**
*   **Intelligence:** The ability to see and perceive the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:44">[55:02:44]</a>.
*   **Diligence and Effort:** Truth does not surrender easily; it requires questioning, criticism, and thorough research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:19:18">[55:19:18]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Defined as "dominance over precedents," meaning understanding historical and contextual similarities to analyze current situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:42:54">[55:42:54]</a>. This includes knowledge of literature and art, as art often reveals truths seen by intelligent and sensitive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:40">[56:21:40]</a>.
*   **Courage:** Required to see and tell the truth, often meaning standing apart from one's community or valued people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:21">[57:01:21]</a>.
*   **Dignity and Sober-mindedness:** Essential for maintaining integrity in the pursuit of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:39">[57:15:39]</a>.
*   **Seriousness:** Loyalty to truth is a difficult and serious endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:33:04">[57:33:04]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that achieving this level of truth-seeking is rare and not for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:41:40">[57:41:40]</a>. Great works in prose, literature, or art share this common denominator: "passion for truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:11">[58:16:11]</a>.

## Case Studies in Historical and Cultural Narratives

### The Gaza Conflict and Israeli Society

The speaker expresses understanding and sorrow for the tragic events in Gaza, acknowledging the genocide taking place there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24:45">[01:00:24]</a>. However, the true horror for the speaker lies in the "state that the Israeli society has fallen into" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06:40">[01:01:06]</a>. He views this as a greater tragedy than the suffering of the Palestinians because Israel was established with idealism and hope for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34:00">[01:01:34]</a>. Over the last 20 years, he has witnessed Israeli society gradually transform into "Nazi savagery," losing basic human characteristics and becoming a "dangerous monster for humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19:07">[01:02:19]</a>. This is attributed to a social pathology stemming from years of living with the fear of being erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45:00">[01:02:45]</a>. The speaker believes that a society gone so out of control has condemned itself to death, which is a sad observation given his past sympathy and visits to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03:00">[01:04:03]</a>. He previously considered the Israeli Jewish community to be culturally superior, but recent events have shattered this optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08:00">[01:05:08]</a>.

### Ottoman Wars and Loyalty to Truth

The speaker references the Armenian Geography of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, a book he recently published, and notes that it has faced criticism from certain "socialite ladies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. He defends his work, emphasizing its role in filling an important gap in the [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye|cultural geography and history of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

When discussing the [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups|Turks' conquest of Anatolia]] after 1071, the speaker corrects the common narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. He states that the Seljuk State did not conquer Anatolia in 1071 but rather caused the collapse of the Byzantine State by forcing them into a military adventure at Malazgirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. The decade after 1071 was a period of tremendous anarchy across Anatolia, with various groups and Armenian lords pursuing their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. Turkish sovereignty was established in Anatolia and Syria only from 1080, starting with Melik Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. The subsequent 70-80 years (from 1080 to around 1150) were a "period of cultural collapse" dominated by "bandit chiefs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. A significant cultural renaissance and revival in Anatolia and Syria only began from 1170-1180, after these principalities achieved economic power and political stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.

### The Disintegration of Yugoslavia

The bombing of Belgrade 25 years ago, in 1999, initiated by President Clinton, is described as a "criminal event" and "an act of barbarism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. For 80 days, cities, industrial facilities, and political institutions were destroyed without reasonable justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Kosovo, a province of Serbia with a predominantly Albanian population, was used as an excuse for independence, leading to the killing of thousands of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. The speaker asserts that Kosovo was transformed into a NATO base, not a truly independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. The actual purpose of the intervention was to destroy Yugoslavia, which was a large and potentially powerful country in Europe, capable of playing an effective role in the post-Soviet world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. This act crushed a state built with "great idealism," dividing it into "7 tiny districts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

Montenegro's potential entry into the European Union is seen as unlikely without Serbia's inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. More than half of Montenegro's population feels strongly Serbian and loyal to Serbia, and Serbia cannot join the EU without recognizing Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### [[Historical narratives on Turkish and regional identities including the origins of certain ethnic groups|The History of Doğu Beyazıt]]

The speaker provides [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups|historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups|historical context for Doğu Beyazıt and the Ishak Pasha Palace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. The palace is described as an "incredible palace" built to challenge major royal residences, but unreliable information exists about its builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. The information on the Ministry of Culture's plaque and online is deemed "fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>. A Kurdish dynasty ruled Doğu Beyazıt from the 14th or early 15th century until 1830, essentially an independent Khanate despite nominal Ottoman tribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. The name "Beyazıt" itself means "Beyzade" (noble person) in Persian, Armenian, or Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:32">[01:36:32]</a>.

The old city of Beyazıt was an important support point during the Kurdish uprising in 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. The Turkish Armed Forces bombed and evacuated the city, burning and destroying it after suppressing the rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. A new city, Doğu Beyazıt, was established 6-7 kilometers away on the plain below in 1930 or 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>. The administrative center of the Ağrı province was moved to Karaköse (Karakilise) a few years before this, and Karakilise was renamed Ağrı to align with the province's name under the Republic of Turkey's efforts to establish modern central authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>.

### The "Will of the People" and the Intellectual Class

The speaker dismisses the concept of "the will of the people" as non-existent, arguing that will resides in individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Since Jean Jacques Rousseau in the 1760s, a claim emerged that intellectuals, due to their education, broad vision, and rational thinking, could understand and represent the will of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. This view formed the basis of modern political thought and democracy for over 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. However, this has "gone bankrupt" today, as the leading class and the concept of "intellectuals" no longer exist in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

### [[Understanding art and cultures role in society|Art and Culture: Baroque vs. Rococo]]

A discussion arises regarding [[understanding_art_and_cultures_role_in_society|art and culture]], specifically the differences between Baroque and Rococo art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

**Baroque Art:**
*   **Period:** 17th century to mid-18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **Nature:** A period of "tremendous creativity explosion" in architecture, painting, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **Subject:** Primarily religion, especially the artistic expression of the Catholic Counter-Reformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.
*   **Style:** Daring, with great imagination and strong emotionality, doing "magnificent works with tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

**Rococo Art:**
*   **Period:** Tail end of Baroque, from 1700s to 1750s/1780s, covering the period of Louis XV and Louis XVI up to the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Nature:** A transitional period, not a school of creative explosion but the "last breath of Baroque" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   **Application:** Known especially as a painting and architecture style; Rococo music is not typically mentioned, with the equivalent being perhaps the "Galant style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.
*   **Subject:** Religious themes disappear from around 1740-1750 onwards, replaced by secular themes, reflecting the Age of Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Instead of religious suffering, it depicts "entertainments of today's elite classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Style:** Combines the ornamented and bold Baroque style with the content of rationalism, but in a reduced or softened manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. It is often underestimated despite producing beautiful works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.

Classicism, appearing after 1780, is presented as the "real language of secularism" and rationalism, returning to simple, serious styles of Ancient Greece and Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

### [[Cultural reflections and historical narratives in Turkey|Continuity of Culture in Architecture]]

The speaker discusses the importance of [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey|cultural continuity]] in architecture, drawing from his experience building houses in Şirince village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. While not advocating for art and culture to be closed to innovation, he observes that in the current era, attempts to create something new often result in "garbage" that lacks permanent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

The main reason for this degeneration is attributed to the "lack of a cultural model, a common cultural vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The idea of creating something new and beautiful, unlike previous styles, has become "almost impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This realization led him to conclude that imitation of existing tradition is the only viable choice, as anything beyond the aesthetic capabilities of 100 years ago often turns out ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This situation reflects living in a "degenerate age," where innovation is often synonymous with ugliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. In this context, the speaker found no solution other than returning to the past for aesthetic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

### Religious Narratives: Catholic vs. Orthodox

The discussion turns to the difference between Catholic and Orthodox churches, particularly concerning their relationship with modernity and traditional beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. The question frames "reactionism" as bigotry, obsession, and an exclusionary attitude towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

**Catholic Church:**
*   **Historical Role:** Has had an intellectual claim, with clergy representing the educated segment of society, receiving secular education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.
*   **Modern Decline:** Entered a "terrible decline" since the 1960s, losing strongholds like Ireland and Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>. Sociologically, it was closer to secular liberal educated Western societies, making it more easily influenced by modern thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>.
*   **Vatican II Mistake:** The speaker believes the decision in the 1960s to modernize and abandon traditional structures was a "big mistake" that led people to drift away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.
*   **Recent Surrender:** The current Pope's "surrender" to secular liberal perspectives, seen in his stance on gay marriage and Covid vaccines, is considered the "nails that are being hammered into the coffin of the Catholic religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. This has led to an uprising and rebellion against the current hierarchy within the Catholic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. The Catholic Church, in its current organization, is deemed "terminally ill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

**Orthodox Church (Eastern Europe):**
*   **Tradition:** Has "never made any concessions to modernity" and remained closed to Western trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>.
*   **Sociological Standing:** Unlike the elite Catholic clergy, Orthodox priests are "one of the people," poor, and integrated into village life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. This has allowed it to maintain prestige among common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>.
*   **Ritual Continuity:** Basic customs like baptism, marriage, and funerals continue with full force in Orthodox countries, unlike in Western countries where baptism and marriage have declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. These ceremonies are still seen as important turning points in people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.

[[turkish_and_greek_historical_relations | Turkey and Greece]] face a "very difficult problem" in their relations, marked by years of [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] developing diplomatic and military infrastructure for a potential war with Greece, often with partially justified reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

## Aegean Sea Disputes
The Aegean Sea situation involves [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey's]] long-term interests, where it has been treated unfairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. For instance, a significant portion of [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey's]] 272-kilometer coastline in the Aegean is effectively ceded to Greece by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This allocation of territory, including islands, occurred without specific reasons during events like those of 1912-13, the Lausanne period of 1918-23, and after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Decisions were made without long-term consideration, as if it was simply "Okay, let Greece take it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Later regrets about these concessions have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Failed Hopes for Amity
Despite both [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] and Greece joining NATO in 1946 and 1951, the hope that being "comrades in arms" would lead to improved relations, mutual understanding, and respect for interests did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The ingrained hostility towards Turks in Greece frequently escalates to significant dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## Geopolitical Alignments
Greece has aligned itself militarily with [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Western countries]] and America, and economically with Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This alignment promotes an understanding that Europe's border ends at islands like Samos, beyond which lies a "wild Asia," which damages trust-based relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

[[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]], particularly since the Ukraine War, faces a new reality of being excluded by Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Subjected to "unacceptable" hostile treatment within NATO, [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | Turkey's role]] has distanced itself from the alliance and seeks to create a new sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. In contrast, Greece has adopted a more radical stance, forming what appears to be a hostile alliance against [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] with the United States in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Risk of Conflict
This course of action is considered dangerous and serious, with potential for war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. While there is a general consensus that [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] would win a direct conflict with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>, the concern is that allies might cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | global balance of power]] is shifting, and the possibility of a NATO-Russia war makes [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey's]] actions critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

The [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkish government]] maintains a "cloud of uncertainty" regarding its role in such a war, a policy considered "very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

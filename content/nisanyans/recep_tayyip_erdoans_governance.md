From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance has been characterized by a significant concentration of power in the hands of the government, a trend observed in Türkiye for many decades, reportedly since the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This concentrated power is not easily relinquished, and the current opposition lacks a comparable force to challenge it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Perceptions of Governance

The government under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] is not widely considered "very unsuccessful" by some observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Doubts exist as to whether any alternative could perform better given Türkiye's current circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. However, it is also deemed an "inadequate government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

### Abandoned Promises and Mistakes

Since 2015, the government is perceived to have abandoned its core promises, such as:
*   Correcting the justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>
*   Solving the Kurdish problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>
*   Solving the Cyprus problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>
*   Establishing peace with Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>

Instead, it has engaged in "ridiculous things" and made significant errors, including the "terrible fiasco" of entering Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Perceived Decline

There is a belief that [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s political "expiration date" has passed, based on several key reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>:

### Arbitrary Justice System
An arbitrary administration has become dominant, profoundly unsettling the society's conscience regarding justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Imprisonment of prominent figures like Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtaş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
*   Thousands of lawsuits filed for insulting the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.
*   Failure to implement court decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.
*   Arbitrary use of violent discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

These practices are considered "extremely harmful and dangerous" for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

### Excessive Power Accumulation
The twenty-year duration of [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s rule has led to an excessive accumulation of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Granting such "unlimited and uncontrolled and unbalanced authority" to one person inevitably leads to:
*   A profound "poisoning of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   Uncontrolled administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
*   Arrogance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

State power is seen as a "very dangerous weapon," and history shows that humanity tends to misuse great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. Effective systems require complex structures and layers of balance to prevent one person from holding unchecked power for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. Twenty years with a "single man" at the helm is considered "very harmful" for any society, regardless of the individual's caliber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

### Promotion of Hate Speech
[[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] has adopted hate speech as a fundamental aspect of his politics and existence, continuously injecting "hatred and anger into society" for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. This has resulted in various segments of society becoming "mad with hatred," which is considered "a shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

## Future of Governance and Leadership

There is a strong belief that [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] "must go now" after twenty years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. However, the speaker expressed doubt that this change can occur through elections, hoping for a "serious and good opponent" to emerge who could offer hope and mobilize the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. The current system appears to have mechanisms in place to prevent such a leader from rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.

Overthrowing [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] by ideologically and politically hostile forces would have "terrible consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. Due to alleged constitutional violations, economic corruption, drug trafficking, and numerous injustices committed over two decades (e.g., "money stuffed into shoeboxes," victimization under statutory decrees, actions in Kurdish provinces, and trusteeships), a "terrible revenge table" is being prepared if the current regime is defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

### Possible Scenarios for Change
It is suggested that either [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] will eventually leave on his own (which is uncertain), or he "must be removed from power in a controlled manner" by someone within his own staff, blocked within an "apparently legal environment and in a decent manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. This internal controlled transition is seen as the "second strongest possibility" after the current regime's continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. The first strongest possibility, at 75%, is that the "old bathhouse, the old stone will continue" for the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.

## Post-Election Observations

### Earthquake's Non-Impact on Political Preferences
Contrary to some predictions, the devastating earthquake did not shift [[political_changes_in_turkey | political preferences]] in affected cities. For instance, in Maraş, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] secured a 75% victory, and the AKP won substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:23:00">[43:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>. The idea that the government was solely responsible for the earthquake's impact, leading to public hatred, was dismissed as flawed reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:00">[44:45:00]</a>. The speaker emphasized that such a large-scale disaster is beyond human control, regardless of the government in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:33:00">[47:33:00]</a>.

### Political Polarization
The [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkish political landscape]] is visually represented as a three-color map: a yellow central part, a thin western strip of another color (Izmir to Istanbul, Thrace, Çanakkale, Muğla), and a large bloc in the southeast (Tunceli and "Kurdistan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>. These regions lack consistency or connection, even their political alliances are superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.

The speaker doubts that Türkiye's political unity can be maintained long-term given a "strictly oppositionist" geography (around 80% with an ethnic-cultural alien texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>, especially after the last election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. A region with a homogeneously Kurdish population (over 80%) that identifies as Kurdish and proud, with a separate history, culture, and music, exists within Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a>. While this co-existence has been possible under a conciliatory regime, the current state of polarization, with society pulled between two repulsive magnetic ends, makes preserving Türkiye's political unity challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

### Political Alliances and Failures
The HDP (Kurdish nationalism) aligning with the US and EU is viewed as a political mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>. The party and its successor performed poorly in the election, suggesting a need for radical change for future viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>. The Kurdish political movement, though, is expected to re-establish under a new formation focused on Kurdish national interests and the struggle for democracy and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>. A strategic mistake was made by the HDP in taking the Turkish Workers' Party as a backup within an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>.

The MHP (Nationalist Movement Party) had a "very successful performance" in the election, achieving its highest vote in recent [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:45:00">[40:45:00]</a>. This occurred despite [[Devlet Bahçeli's | Devlet Bahçeli]]'s recent "absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:00">[41:04:00]</a>. In contrast, the Good Party, formed by opposing MHP, was deemed a "fiasco" and failed, getting less votes than Devlet Bahçeli's "dead self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. The parties led by former AKP members, Deva and Davutoğlu's party, showed support below 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

### Election Results Manipulation
There is a lack of confidence in election results in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:00">[53:36:00]</a>. The Supreme Election Council's announcement of [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s victory on election night, despite high opposition expectations, could have caused unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:02:00">[54:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:10:00">[54:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>. However, by delaying the final announcement for 15 days, allowing the public to adapt to the reality, potential widespread reaction was defused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:34:00">[54:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:37:00">[54:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:53:00">[54:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:06:00">[55:06:00]</a>. This is seen as a "very skillful move" by "smart people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:13:00">[55:13:00]</a>.

### International Relations
Türkiye's most rational option for the future is to align with Russia, seen as the undisputed winner of the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:19:00">[58:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>. Developments in Syria necessitate Türkiye's withdrawal, which should be done through agreement and cooperation with Russia and Saudi Arabia to avoid a defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:59:00">[57:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:11:00">[58:11:00]</a>. The deepening cooperation between Ankara and Moscow, as stated by the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, is considered appropriate and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:00">[57:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:00">[57:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:36:00">[58:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>.

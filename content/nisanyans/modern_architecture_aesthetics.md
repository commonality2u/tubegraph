Modern architecture, particularly from the 20th century onwards, is characterized by a widespread uniformity and a perceived aesthetic decline across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. This phenomenon is observed in countries as diverse as [[impact_of_architecture_in_anatolia | Greece]] and [[impact_of_architecture_in_anatolia | Turkey]], where school buildings and other structures are deemed "equally ugly" despite historical isolation between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. This shared aesthetic applies globally, extending to Russia, China, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>.

## A Global Aesthetic Blindness

The widespread adoption of this aesthetic has led to a state of "aesthetic blindness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. The speaker expresses bewilderment at how all countries seemingly became aesthetically displeasing simultaneously, as if a "ray came and disrupted the DNA of such a people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. This is part of a broader [[critique_of_modern_western_art_and_culture | critique of modern Western art and culture]] and [[postmodern_architecture_and_cultural_reflection | postmodern architecture and cultural reflection]].

## Contrast with Historical Architecture

This modern trend stands in stark contrast to the historical architectural traditions observed globally:
*   **Europe** Europe, having preserved much of its older architecture, acutely highlights the painful differences and contrasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. For hundreds of years, Europeans constructed "incredibly beautiful places," including buildings and comprehensive city and town architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Tremendous effort was invested in beautifying living spaces and creating unique beauties across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. Masterpieces were created in periods such as the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the [[cultural_analysis_of_baroque_vs_rococo_art | Baroque period]], continuing until the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. These included both grand royal works and the designs of small villages and towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.
*   **India** India, despite its current architectural state, possesses a beautiful architectural tradition spanning thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

## The 20th Century Shift

The period of aesthetically pleasing architecture "all of a sudden... ended with a hiss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. In the 20th century, the focus shifted to constructing "parking lots" and "Boxes and Boxes of ugliness that darken the soul of man," a trend that continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

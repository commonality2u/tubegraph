The speaker shared personal anecdotes regarding the wearing of cultural attire and the societal reactions they evoked. These experiences highlight individual preferences and the unspoken norms associated with dress in different environments.

## The Diyarbakır Cap
The speaker received a Diyarbakır cap as a gift from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. However, the cap was a bit small due to the speaker's large head size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. An attempt was made to enlarge it by opening its stitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, with the master in Diyarbakır providing a polite response on how to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. The cap was eventually removed during the chat because it made the speaker's head sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Cultural Garments and Public Appearance
The speaker expressed a fondness for wearing traditional garments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır Shalwar**: At one time, the speaker owned a black Diyarbakır shalwar in Şirince and enjoyed wearing it, walking around a lot in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Egyptian Cellabiye**: In Egypt, the speaker purchased a cellabiye, a full robe, and wore it extensively while traveling across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. A notable instance involved wearing the cellabiye to breakfast at a resort hotel by the sea, an activity not typically undertaken by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This choice of attire led to astonished looks from other guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The speaker noted that wearing a cellabiye makes one appear to belong to the "working class," contrasting with the setting of a "stylish hotel in Hurghada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

The speaker also touches upon the broader societal issues of "moral anchor" and "cultural depth," regretting that those lacking these qualities have "occupied all the critical points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This phenomenon is viewed as a symptom of a deep-rooted "social disease" dating back to the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

While the 1915 Deportation did not generally target Istanbul's Armenian population, a significant migration wave occurred from the city to France in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Reasons for Migration

The primary catalyst for this mass departure was the panic that spread throughout Istanbul following the fall of Izmir to Turkish forces in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The speaker's family, who had resided in Istanbul for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, joined this exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## The Mass Migration to France

For the first time, France permitted the mass migration of Armenians from Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This opportunity had not been available in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. In the months immediately following Izmir's capture by the Turks in September 1922, many Armenians "packed into ships and went in great panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The speaker's family, including their grandmother and siblings, departed for France together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Return to Istanbul

After residing in Paris for two to three years, the speaker's grandfather decided to return to Turkey, as he found life there unfulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Upon his return, he endeavored to revive his publishing house, which had previously specialized in publishing French literature translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, but found no one to help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Instead, he opened bookstores and second-hand bookseller shops near BeyazÄ±t Square, becoming one of Istanbul's most prominent booksellers until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Educational Impact

The closure of all [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools in Istanbul]] in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> significantly impacted individuals like the speaker's grandmother. As a fifteen-year-old middle school student, her education was interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. She subsequently attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years, which contributed to her knowledge of French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools]] were eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

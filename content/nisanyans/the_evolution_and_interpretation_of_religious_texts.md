## Early Religion as "Scientific" Hypothesis

Religion, in its early stages, appears to be a part of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. For instance, people might explain someone getting lost in a forest by attributing it to "Jinn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Similarly, the victory of the Achaeans over Troy in ancient Greek narratives could be attributed to a god like Akon taking their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. These serve as scientific hypotheses that, while not necessarily true, were falsifiable and aimed to explain phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

[[exploration_of_cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_religion_and_sacredness | Humanity]] has always faced a bombardment of data and phenomena it cannot comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. From infancy, individuals cope by forming assumptions and testing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This method, where one tests hypotheses and revises them upon encountering contradictory results, is the basis of rational thought and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Even ancient texts like the Torah show scientific effort in their initial lines, for example, by describing the separation of earth and sky as a "Big Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. In polytheistic contexts, divine actions are often presented as falsifiable claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## The Turning Point: Judaism and Unfalsifiable Faith

[[monotheism_and_religious_evolution_in_ancient_civilizations | Judaism]] marks a significant turning point in the evolution of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Unlike Greek religion, which often operated in a mythological field, the God of the Jews actively participates in and directs the course of history with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. Questioning this God or the stories about Him increasingly carries politically risky consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

This evolution led to the emergence of a God concept that is increasingly abstract, incomprehensible, and, crucially, cannot be falsified by any evidence in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Whether it is the God of the Quran or the God of the Bible, there is an answer for every question, making it impossible to refute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. For example, questions about why God created the devil, why there is injustice, or why Adam sinned all have ready answers within theological frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Faith vs. Reason in Religious Texts

A key distinction arises between belief as a scientific fact and belief as an act of faith. In [[historical_religious_texts_and_interpretations | Christian doctrine]], the ascension of Jesus to heaven is an event no one witnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. To believe in something with "no rational possibility" is presented as the essence of being a true Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. If one attempts to explain it with scientific hypotheses, they are considered not a true Christian but rather a normal person who approaches the world with doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

This idea is encapsulated by early Western Christian thinkers like Tertullian, who believed "to the point of absurdity because it is impossible to believe," or "I believe because it is illogical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This means faith, by definition, is a reasoning style not based on falsifiable evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

Modern discussions with Muslims often reach this point regarding unprovable claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. For example, regarding the prohibition of pork, despite arguments for its economic, biological, and sociological usefulness, the ultimate answer from a believer is often simply "because I believe this" and "I am not obliged to question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This suggests that faith and reason, at a certain point, cannot meet on common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## The Quranic Narrative of Mary: A Case Study

The Quran mentions Mary, identifying her as the daughter of Imran, the mother of Jesus, and the sister of Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. In contrast, the Torah mentions Mary, the sister of Moses, whose brother was Aaron and father was Imran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

A rational approach suggests that the writer of the Quran likely confused these two historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. While it's possible to hypothesize other explanations (e.g., another Imran, another Harun, or two Marys with identical family names), the most straightforward and likely conclusion based on available data is a mixing of narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Muhammad's Knowledge of Texts

During the time of Muhammad, both the Torah and the Bible were known at least by hearsay in the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. There were significant Jewish communities in and around Mecca and Medina, and Christians were also widely present, with several episcopal sees existing before Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Many major Arab poets before Muhammad were Christian or semi-Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

While Muhammad likely did not read these books himself and may not have even seen a physical book, he would have gained knowledge of their contents through interaction with his neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. This indirect knowledge could naturally lead to inaccuracies or merging of distinct stories, such as the two Marys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. The speaker argues that it is natural for Muhammad to have made some errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. However, the current fixed nature of the Quranic text, where "you can't change the comma," suggests that later opportunities for intervention to correct these points were not taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Future Discussions

Future discussions on this topic will delve into the origins and formation of [[historical_religious_texts_and_interpretations | holy books]] such as the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran through a philological lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The aim is to understand how [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | religion]] can be engaged with through reason, and how religious narratives can be explained using more rational, common-sense thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. This includes exploring the position of religion within Human Rights Law and the limits of freedom of expression in religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.

Turkey's political and social landscape is deeply influenced by its complex tapestry of cultural dynamics and diverse ethnic identities. Discussions around national identity, historical narratives, and societal attitudes reflect these underlying complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

## Defining "Turkishness"

The term "Turk" in Turkey has been monopolized and imposed as an element of tyranny by the administrative staff of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. This contrasts with countries like Germany, where the majority population is ethnically German, and they proudly established their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. The word "Turkish" expresses a specific segment of society with clear boundaries, defined by politics, ideology, and to some extent, language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. It represents a social group united by shared language, state belonging, similar cultural traditions, memories, and religion/sect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

### The Kurdish Identity

A significant minority of Turkey's population refuses to call themselves Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. For two millennia, Kurds have maintained a distinct identity, speaking a different language, possessing a different culture, and having a unique social memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. In their historical memory, Turks have sometimes been allies but often enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

Similar to how Tatars and Chechens under Russian rule identify as Tatars and Chechens rather than Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>, Kurds do not wish to be called Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. They are a separate nation with different social organization, habits, traditions, and epic tales, and they can exist under a common political identity without abandoning their distinct national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. The only obstacle to this coexistence is the "narrow-minded, bigoted, and stupid policies" of the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. Attempts by the Turkish state to humiliate Kurds and ban their language and identity have led to internal troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. The state's discourse of imposing its will on citizens is "clearly not working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.

### Non-Muslim Identities

Historically, non-Muslim groups in Turkey, particularly Greeks and Armenians, have never considered themselves Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>. Being called a Turk was often considered a "great insult," a "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. This did not prevent them from coexisting with Turks within the same state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. However, after 1923, the significant Greek population was largely "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. The state has not been able to "destroy the Kurds," and they need to face this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.

## Historical Migrations and Settlements

Anatolia, defined as the peninsula of Asia Minor west of the Euphrates, has distinct historical and demographic characteristics compared to the regions east of the Euphrates, which include Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

### Armenian Migrations

There have been two major waves of Armenian migration towards western Turkey:
*   **Early 17th Century:** Around 1602-1603, a massive migration wave occurred from Sivas, Eğin, and Erzincan due to the Celali rebellions, insecurity, and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. This migration is the origin of the Armenian community in Istanbul, and also impacted the Marmara Region (İzmit, Tekirdağ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Mid-17th Century:** A second significant Armenian migration came from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. Communities in Bilecik, Geyve, and north of İzmit have Iranian Armenian origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. The Ottoman Empire welcomed these migrations because they needed people who would "work" and "do business," unlike some Turks who "sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

Continuous Armenian migration also occurred from places like Kayseri to Konya and İzmir, following commercial opportunities and tradesmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. For instance, if a town like Sivrihisar (which had a notable Armenian community and a church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>) needed tradesmen (shoemakers, tailors, jewelers, weavers) or merchants, Armenians from Kayseri, Sivas, or Bayburt would settle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

### Turkic Settlement Dynamics

Turkmen tribes migrated simultaneously to all regions, including Muğla, Diyarbakır, Mardin, Ardahan, Van, Tabriz, Mosul, Damascus, Aleppo, and Kirkuk, establishing principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. Over the subsequent 200-300 years, an interesting phenomenon occurred: Turks did not assimilate in the east of the Euphrates, but established "absolute dominance" in the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. Within 100-200 years of the Turkish conquest, areas like Muğla, Denizli, Aydın, Manisa, Kütahya, and Eskişehir became entirely Turkish, while Turks in places like Mosul, Mardin, and Ahlat assimilated or "melted away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>. This difference in demographic outcomes merits further historical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. This historical context is vital for the [[examination_of_ethnic_and_cultural_identity_in_turkey | examination of ethnic and cultural identity in Turkey]] and [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics of ethnic groups in Turkey]].

## Societal Attitudes and Political Implications

The current state leadership's policies foster a "diluted fascist dictatorship" built on hostility towards its own citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This approach makes it difficult to understand the future of policies, including foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. The nation's experience with [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | political dynamics and social issues in Turkey]] and [[societal_attitudes_and_discrimination_in_turkey | societal attitudes and discrimination in Turkey]] demonstrates the ongoing challenge of achieving a harmonious multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society. The need for a comprehensive history of Turkey is highlighted, especially concerning the regions east and west of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>. These dynamics greatly impact the [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | political and social implications of ethnic shifts in Turkey]] and [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | social dynamics and politics in Turkey]].

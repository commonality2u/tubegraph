Monastic institutions, particularly monasteries, have played a significant role in the historical and cultural [[Development and Influence of Religious Institutions|development and influence of religious institutions]] of the Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Middle East geographies [01:15:34].

## Monasteries as Centers of Culture and Education

Historically, these institutions were foundational to the existence of a writing culture [01:12:05] in regions like Eastern Anatolia, Armenia, and Kurdistan [01:11:56]. Six hundred years ago, it was common for people to write extensive texts [01:11:50]. This was not a vacuum-formed culture; it relied on established institutions [01:12:10].

Monasteries served as centers where individuals were educated and trained [01:12:26]. For instance, a talented child might be given to a monastery at a young age to learn writing and produce "huge volumes" within its disciplinary structure [01:12:37]. Writing was considered a profession, a mastery, and an art, akin to carpentry, requiring an organized institution for its teaching [01:12:57].

These institutions were particularly effective during the Islamic rule period, specifically the 15th and 16th centuries [01:13:23]. Monasteries, though not necessarily large or wealthy [01:13:35], were foundations often found slightly outside villages [01:13:42]. They housed communities ranging from five to ten people, or even 100 to 150 in larger ones [01:13:50], living simply, detached from worldly pleasures [01:14:06].

Crucially, monasteries possessed the economic infrastructure—such as land, fields, and livestock—to sustain their communities [01:14:10]. This stable economic base allowed them to maintain a "certain tradition, certain goals and ideals" across generations, enabling them to raise literate individuals [01:14:43].

## Decline and Modern Challenges

The speaker contends that the disappearance of these monastic institutions and the failure to establish equivalent structures in their place signify a "very serious sign of collapse" [01:15:34]. Following the Islamic conquest, monastic structures gradually became obsolete, losing their function, wealth, and economic infrastructure, including their lands [01:15:49]. Nothing of comparable strength was established to replace them [01:16:15].

In the Islamic world, the equivalent institution was the lodge (*tekke* or *dergah*), which was effective in the 13th and 14th centuries [01:16:22]. However, the lodge "never reached the vitality and power of the monastery and degenerated over time" [01:16:35]. The speaker suggests that the institutions of Christians, having lost their cultural function, are now "dead," and Muslims have not been able to replace them with "anything honest and new structures specific to the modern age" [01:16:51].

## Attempts at Revival: The Mor Gabriel Monastery and Şirince

The **Mor Gabriel Monastery** in Turabdin serves as a compelling example of an institution that defied this decline [01:17:49]. Described as a "lonely island in the middle of Kurdish and Arab villages," it was nearly abandoned by the 1960s and 1970s [01:18:08]. However, through the "stubbornness of a brave leader," it was revived and "rose again as an educational institution, a focus of civilization, a place where people can go and stay" [01:18:30]. The success of Mor Gabriel, which managed to overcome significant financial, economic, practical, social, and bureaucratic difficulties [02:21:20], has been a source of inspiration, demonstrating that a "cultural oasis can be created in the middle of the desert" [02:00:08].

The speaker draws inspiration from Mor Gabriel for the initiatives undertaken in Şirince [01:52:00]. The goal in Şirince has been to create structures that can meet the needs of modern Turkey in a secular world, outside of traditional Christian theology, yet still foster a similar cultural environment [01:52:10]. This endeavor highlights the "great deficiency of the foundation tradition that has been largely killed in modern society" [02:22:01]. The speaker notes the practical and theoretical difficulties in establishing and sustaining institutions dedicated to purposes beyond financial profit in contemporary society [02:22:52].

## Impact on Society and Modernity

The abandonment of religious institutions is linked to a societal crisis [01:48:16]. The speaker suggests that modern Western society has entered a "period of suicide" due to a culture that has gone astray from its roots [01:48:39]. This is viewed as a consequence of religion losing its credibility, especially as alternative "information theories" (science) explained the world in a "much better, much more logical way" [01:51:32].

Religions, particularly those with strong written traditions like Christianity and Islam, struggled to adapt and evolved [01:52:08]. This led to a rejection of the knowledge world offered by religion by "cultured and educated people" [01:52:32], resulting in the collapse of religious authority [01:52:51]. Eastern religions, with more flexible theology and less "bookish" structures, were more successful in adapting to the modern world [01:53:26].

In addition to knowledge, religion provided a "tradition discipline" related to concepts of family, morality, and principles of right living [01:54:22]. The decline of the church as a moral counter-authority to the state, particularly evident during the Covid crisis when churches largely aligned with state measures, further signifies a "bankruptcy" of these institutions [01:55:22]. This situation is seen as a symptom of a society becoming increasingly "crazy" [01:57:31]. The speaker states that the collapse of the Western world is a reality that will become more apparent to people in Turkey in the coming years [01:57:58].

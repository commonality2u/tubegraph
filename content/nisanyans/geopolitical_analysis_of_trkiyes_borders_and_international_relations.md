## Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Foreign Policy and Leadership

The speaker notes a frequent criticism or question regarding their position on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, specifically the perceived shift from praise to critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. They outline four core themes consistently expressed over the past three to five years regarding Erdoğan's political standing:

1.  **Political Acumen**: Erdoğan is regarded as a "very smart person" and a "political genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. He consistently wins by doing the "exact opposite" of what people considered smart suggest in crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, consolidating his power further each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The political maneuver he executed around the December 17 incidents (2013-2014) is described as a "masterpiece of political science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, though potentially immoral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The speaker suggests that the "expert, educated, intellectual, civilized" group in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Türkiye]] cannot perceive this truth due to political or class hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This group has "become more and more stupid" and unable to understand over 21 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Credible Opposition**: Erdoğan's 21-year tenure is attributed not to the "stupidity of the Turkish people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, but to the absence of a "credible alternative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The opposition is depicted as a "scarecrow" with "no vision, no excitement, no hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, merely repeating "stale words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, and raising suspicion of "playing a double game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Their partner party is labeled "the real representative of the darkest and most rotten elements of 1990s [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
3.  **Foreign Policy and State Consensus**: On foreign policy, it is debated whether Erdoğan dictates it or represents a state consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The speaker believes the current policy is "the right policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> despite "ridiculous mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Given the world's rapid axis shift and the "sinking Western world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> (likened to the collapse of the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>), [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s primary goal should be to establish and maintain "relative independence and distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The speaker has no idea what rivals offer in foreign policy and doubts their "will, determination and skill" to continue even the current state consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
4.  **Personal Antipathy**: The speaker's personal antipathy towards Erdoğan has grown for 21 years since his mayoral election in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, reaching an "unbearable point" after the recent earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Erdoğan's discourse is characterized by spewing "hatred and threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, which is compared to Adolf Hitler's tactic of foundation on hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This "hate feast" is seen as making people sick, driving them to despair, and making "constructive thought, devotion and solidarity impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

The speaker concludes that these four views (Erdoğan is smart, his opponents are terrible, his foreign policy is sound, and he is a sociopath) are not contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Political Choice and Election Outlook

Prior to the earthquake, the speaker's political inclination was "50-50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, with a natural tendency to vote for the HDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. If forced to choose between Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, they would likely not vote, or their vote would lean 51% for Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. However, after the earthquake, the needle turned the other way, towards 51% Kılıçdaroğlu, feeling "Enough is enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This shift has since become unstable due to the opposition's perceived inability to move beyond "same old clichés and empty words" in response to the earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The speaker believes that the election has been "shelved" and will likely be postponed against the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. They question who would resist such a move if Erdoğan declared a postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. The closing of schools is seen as a "very serious pregnancy" and a "move to go into war mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>, potentially driven by concerns about a "political coup, internal coup, regime coup, a turmoil in universities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## Türkiye's Borders: Historical Context and Geopolitical Implications

The question of how [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Türkiye]]'s borders with Syria and Iraq were drawn is addressed.

### Syrian Border

The Syrian border was primarily drawn by England and France, but it appears to have been finalized through negotiations with the Ottoman Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This border, established surprisingly easily after the Armistice of Mondros in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>, was later adopted as the target in the National Pact by the Turkish national struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. The only uncertainty was the Hatay issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

The border has two main features:
1.  It largely follows the Baghdad railway line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>, with the railway itself remaining in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a> and the border drawn 200 meters ahead of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. This was because Türkiye wanted to retain the railway line it had invested heavily in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
2.  Especially on the Kilis side, it approximates the Arab-Turkish ethnic border, ensuring Turkish villages remained in Türkiye and Arab villages in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. However, due to the railway factor, a "considerable Arab population" remained on the Turkish side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

### Iraqi Border

The speaker is less certain about the exact determination of the Iraqi border, suggesting it might have been more random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. There is no clear logical or natural border like a railway line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. The border was not stabilized until 1926-1927 after the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, with Türkiye insistently seeking control over areas like Mosul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.

## Global Power Dynamics and Türkiye's Position

The speaker analyzes [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | global geopolitical changes]] and investment patterns, noting a shift away from traditional Western dominance:

*   **China**: Leads large infrastructure projects globally with "very generous loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>, including in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a> and Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. This presence is observed across the world, including South America and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.
*   **Arab Capital (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE)**: Behind large administrative and real estate speculation projects, exemplified by "mind-boggling construction projects" recently launched from Saudi Arabia to show power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Russian Oligarchs**: Responsible for "more modest" projects worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Europe**: Described as "bankrupt since 2008" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>, with nothing to offer other countries beyond chain markets and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Their culture is seen as "stingy" and based on "short-term profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   **America**: Only sells weapons and offers "no other benefit to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

The speaker criticizes a journalist's suggestion to "marry" Türkiye's earthquake-affected provinces to "friendly countries" like USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This list is seen as ignorant for omitting countries that actually provide significant investment and cooperation in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

### Ukraine War and German Geopolitics

The Ukraine war is presented as primarily being "about Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>, similar to the First and Second World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. Russia's victory in Ukraine is considered inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. The core issue is the potential natural partnership between Western Europe (especially Germany) and Russia, where Germany would sell high-tech products to Russia and buy cheap natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

After the Cold War, the "natural evolution" was for Europe and Russia to integrate, with Russia becoming an "essential member of the European community of nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. Russia and Germany were ready for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>, but the United States perceived such a "marriage" as the "biggest threat to its world domination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a> and sabotaged it, leading to the Ukrainian War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.

A year into the war, the speaker observes:
*   The Ukrainian army has been destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>, with estimated losses of 150,000-250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.
*   Ukrainian infrastructure is destroyed, with cities becoming uninhabitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.
*   Russia's goals of "denazification and demilitarization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a> (removing the Ukrainian army as a dangerous organ and eliminating NATO-trained fascist militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>) appear to have been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.
*   American goals of disintegrating Russia, changing its regime, and destroying its economy have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
*   The Russian economy has performed better than Western European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.
*   Russia's international diplomatic position has strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>, achieving a serious rapprochement with Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>.
*   Europe is seen as "going downhill like a truck whose brakes have failed, towards collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.

The speaker believes Russia will not end the war with a "general offensive" like August 26, 1922, because NATO "cannot tolerate a defeat of this magnitude" and would strike elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:23">[01:29:23]</a> (e.g., Poland, Moldova, Baltic countries, Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>). A smart approach is to "leave an escape route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a> for NATO, perhaps by allowing Ukrainians to overthrow their regime and inviting Russia and Germany to establish order in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>, potentially leading to a Polish-Russian partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>.

Haiti is historically significant, though its contemporary global contribution is largely limited to New York City taxi drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. The island of Santo Domingo and Haiti is home to two states: Haiti itself and the Dominican Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

## Colonial Exploitation and the Spark of Revolution
Historically, the island was a "concentration camp" and "production camp" deeply seized by French and Spanish colonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. It operated outside the control of central states, seemingly free from legal, traditional, religious, and moral constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of African slaves were brought to the island and forced to work "like animals" to produce sugarcane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. It was essentially a "terrible prison camp" established to send sugar to Europe, where white colonists were outnumbered by African slaves by 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

## The Haitian Slave Uprising
Inspired by the [[French Revolution and Related Movies | French Revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>, the French half of the island revolted around 1791 or 1792 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. The rebels "slaughtered all the whites" and their owners before declaring a republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

The revolutionary regime in France, despite its proclaimed principles of equality, freedom, and fraternity, sent an army to Haiti to suppress the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. They committed "incredible massacres," including hanging, cutting, and burning people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. However, they ultimately failed, and France was compelled to grant Haiti independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. The actions of the [[French Revolution and Related Movies | French Revolution]] and Napoleon in Haiti are considered "among the greatest crimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

## Post-Revolutionary State and Broader Implications
Despite establishing a republic, Haiti was perceived as a "garbage country" then and has remained so to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. After massacring and destroying the white ruling class, a "tyrannical dictator team" emerged from the native and black populations, governing the country until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.

Currently, Haiti is described as "not governed" and has devolved into a "disaster dump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. It is considered the poorest country in the Americas and one of the poorest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. The country lacks proper production and is afflicted by terror and internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

### Impact on Colonialism
The slave rebellion in Haiti, alongside similar uprisings under British rule, significantly influenced England and the United States to reconsider and eventually halt their colonial endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

> The speaker notes that the ruling classes of colonial countries were not initially pleased with the "adventurous looters" who established colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. These colonists were often individuals who could not maintain a reputable life in their homelands, engaging in robbery and banditry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. However, once "good money" began flowing from the colonies, the British State and its elite started to benefit and grow wealthy, leading to a shift in attitude where they embraced the idea of "bringing some civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. This illustrates how money can act as "an acid that melts moral principles and political principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

This article explores the complex ethnic and demographic shifts in Eastern Türkiye, drawing insights from a book that delves into the region's history and current state. The book, titled "Türkiye: East of Ankara" in its Turkish version, was published in 2006 and written over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. It aims to present a sensitive topic without causing undue alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The English and Turkish versions of the book differ due to addressing different audiences and their pre-existing prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The author conducted extensive field research, visiting numerous cities and villages across the region, including Van, Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, and Dersim, and engaging with diverse people, from villagers to gendarmerie commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Historical Demographics of Eastern Anatolia

Before the 20th century, particularly until the early 1900s, major cities in Eastern Anatolia, such as Van and Diyarbakır, had a predominantly Turkish population, especially among the youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. In 1910, the center of Van showed no trace of a Kurdish presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. In Diyarbakır, Turkish was widely spoken, and the dominant families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This pattern, where Turks formed the ruling class, was common across the Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

The "Turkish" identity of the ruling class was often a result of assimilation. Individuals from various origins—Albanian, Circassian, Georgian, or Dagestani—would become Turkish upon migrating to cities, gaining education, and entering state mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. The Ottoman ruling class was a cosmopolitan mix of many origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Alongside the Turkish population, non-Muslim communities, particularly Armenians and Assyrians, were crucial to the urban infrastructure. At the beginning of the 20th century, approximately half of Van's population was Turkish, with a significant Armenian population (20-30%) and Assyrians also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. In Mardin, the ruling class was Christian, and the city's primary language was Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Many of the Turkish families in these cities had Armenian ancestors, indicating deep historical intertwining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Their Consequences

### Elimination of Armenian Population and Urban Decay
The [[ethnic_cleansing_and_historical_contradictions | elimination of the Armenian population]] from the region had an unforeseen and negative consequence for the Turks. It rendered cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin uninhabitable, as essential urban services like dentists, tailors, or insurance companies disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. The cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure provided by these groups vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Decline of Turkish Elite and Urban Collapse
During the Republican period, the Turkish-speaking elite in these eastern cities dwindled as their children migrated to Ankara and Istanbul for education, with no intention of returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Consequently, these cities experienced a gradual collapse and decay until the 1960s, described as regressing to the "Stone Age" or "Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Rural-to-Urban Migration and Kurdishization
The 1960s marked a significant shift with economic development leading to massive rural-to-urban migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This migration resulted in the gradual "Kurdification" of the region's cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

In Mardin, which had no significant Kurdish presence in its city center in the 1970s and 1980s, the surrounding rural areas were predominantly Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. An implicit policy in Mardin to prevent Turks from migrating to the city led to the nearby city of Kızıltepe, a Kurdish city, experiencing immense growth and becoming larger than Mardin itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. However, this "wall" eventually collapsed, and today Kurds constitute the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

Currently, Diyarbakır is almost entirely Kurdish, with 80-90% of its population being Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Van also has an overwhelming Kurdish majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### The "Kurdification" of the East
The speaker states that the greatest success of the Republican regime in Eastern Türkiye has been the complete "Kurdification" of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. While Kurds were a significant element before, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. Today, they are an almost homogeneous population in their own region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

## Social and Linguistic Implications

The "Kurdification" has created undeniable social demands. The speaker asserts that it is impossible to prevent the recognition of Kurdish as an official language in the region, perhaps as a second official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Kurdish is spoken by the overwhelming majority of a population of nearly 20 million, with pride, and its use in schools, streets, government offices, and broadcasting is becoming dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. Delaying this recognition will only exacerbate problems and could lead to an "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. It is argued that everyone, including Turks, living in the region must learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

The region now has a homogeneous Kurdish population of 20 million, with 87-90% dominance in their own area, possessing their own language and a class of "organic intellectuals" dedicated to expressing a national ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

## Political and Military Implications

### Challenges to an Independent Kurdish State
Despite the demographic and social shifts, the speaker believes that establishing an independent Kurdish state in the region is difficult due to the [[impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_global_powers | international conjuncture]] and the significant military power imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. The military power of the Republic of Turkey vastly outweighs the total military power of various Kurdish factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

The United States, a vital partner and ally of Turkey, would not support the disintegration of Turkey or impose a policy that forces Turkey to step aside for the creation of [[the_future_of_kurdistan_and_its_geopolitical_implications | Kurdistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

### Geopolitical Interests in a Fragmented Türkiye
The speaker identifies specific powers that would benefit from a weakening of Türkiye's control in the region and its long-term loss of control:
*   **Russia**: Türkiye is viewed as a state established to pose a threat to Russia, especially as it was included in NATO with this aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. From Russia's long-term perspective, Türkiye, along with Germany, is seen as a potential threat in a future war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Therefore, the division and rupture of Türkiye, particularly in the regions closer to Russia, would suit Russia's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>.
*   **Syria and Iraq**: These neighboring states would also benefit from the creation of [[the_future_of_kurdistan_and_its_geopolitical_implications | Kurdistan]] or multiple Kurdish entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.
*   **Saudi Arabia and Egypt**: The speaker implies these countries might also benefit, but explicitly states America would not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

This analysis highlights how regional ethnic changes intertwine with broader geopolitical strategies and have profound implications for state stability and international relations.

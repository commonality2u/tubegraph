This article examines the **political and social implications of ethnic shifts in [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]]**, particularly focusing on Eastern Anatolia. It draws insights from a bilingual book, "[[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] East of Ankara," published in 2006, which approaches its Turkish and English versions with different perspectives to address varying preconceptions of its readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The book's aim was to discuss a sensitive subject like Eastern [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] without causing undue alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The research for the book involved extensive travel and interviews across various provinces and villages in Eastern Anatolia, including Arda, Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Historical Ethnic Composition of Eastern Anatolia

In the past, until the early 20th century, the major cities of Eastern Anatolia were primarily inhabited by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For instance, in the 1910s, there was "no trace of Kurds" in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Diyarbakır's center saw both Kurdish and Turkish spoken, but its major families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This pattern, where the ruling class was Turkish, was common throughout the Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Ottoman Era Dynamics
The Ottoman ruling class was cosmopolitan, with diverse origins; individuals who migrated to cities, gained education, and held positions in the state mechanism would "automatically become Turks" and speak Turkish, integrating into Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Their origins could be Albanian, Dagestani, Georgian, or Circassian, but the outcome of this mixture was identified as Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### The Role of Non-Muslims
Non-Muslim communities, particularly Armenians, played a significant role in providing urban services in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. At the turn of the 20th century, about half of Van's population was Turkish, and more than half of Diyarbakır was governed by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. There were also Armenian and Assyrian populations, making up 20-30% in some areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In Mardin, the ruling class was Christian, and Arabic was the city's language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Many Turkish families in the region had Armenian lineage, indicating deep intermingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Mardin's Specifics
Even historically Kurdish families, like the sons of Şeref Han, became part of the empire's ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. When the speaker first visited Mardin in the 1970s and 80s, the city itself showed no trace of Kurds, while the surrounding rural areas were predominantly Kurdish and Arab-speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Impact of Armenian Elimination
The elimination of the Armenian population had unforeseen negative consequences for Turks, as it effectively left cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin uninhabitable in terms of essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The group that provided the cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Republican Era Shifts
During the Republican period, the Turkish-speaking elite in these cities diminished, sending their children to study in Ankara and Istanbul, who then chose not to return to their hometowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This led to a gradual collapse and decay of these cities until the 1960s, with the region described as being in the "Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Rural-to-Urban Migration and Kurdishization
From the 1960s onward, economic development spurred significant rural-to-urban migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This led to the gradual "Turkification" of all cities in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. However, paradoxically, the "greatest success" of the Republican regime in Eastern [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] has been the "complete Kurdishization of this region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. While Kurds were a significant but primarily rural element before, they are now almost homogeneously dominant in their own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Case Studies: Mardin, Kızıltepe, Diyarbakır, Van
In Mardin, initial resistance to Kurdish migration into the city center led to the growth of nearby Kızıltepe, which became a larger, predominantly Kurdish settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Eventually, this resistance collapsed, and Kurds are now the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Diyarbakır is now close to 100% Kurdish, or at least 80-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Van also has a significant Kurdish majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Political and Social Implications of Kurdishization]]
The demographic shift has created social demands that are considered impossible to prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Language Demands
While Turkish is the official language, there's a strong demand for Kurdish to be recognized and taught, especially in schools and public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[0:10:56]</a>. With a population of nearly 20 million, predominantly Kurdish speakers, it's argued that suppressing the language, spoken with pride, is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. It's believed that anyone living in or wishing to live in the region, including Turks, will eventually have to learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Delaying this recognition will only lead to further problems and potential instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Challenges to Central Authority
The region now has a homogeneous population of 20 million, with 87-90% Kurdish dominance and its own language and "organic intellectuals" who seek to express national ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Efforts to suppress this reality by arresting leaders or bombing cities are deemed futile and temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While establishing a separate state seems difficult due to international conjuncture and military power disparities with the Republic of [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, the current situation is unsustainable.

## International Perspectives on [[political_and_social_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye's]] Eastern Region
Different international powers have varying interests in the stability or destabilization of Eastern [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye]].

### US Stance
It is argued that the United States would not abandon a vital partner and ally like [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]] or seek its disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The idea of the US pushing for an independent Kurdistan against [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]]'s wishes is dismissed as implausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Russian and Regional Interests
However, powers that would benefit from [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s control weakening in the region in the long term include Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is historically seen by some as a state established to pose a threat to Russia, particularly as a NATO member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. In a long-term strategic view, [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is considered one of three potential threats to Russia in a future conflict, along with Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Therefore, the division or rupture of [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], especially the part closer to Russia, would suit Russian interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. States that would benefit from the creation of a Kurdistan or multiple Kurdistans in the region are identified as Russia, Syria, Iraq, and potentially Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but not America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

Cemalettin Taşçı, a guest on the program, discusses several significant changes observed within human society, particularly noting shifts in [[Biological functions and evolutionary roles | reproductive behavior]] and [[Social roles and dynamics in various regions | social roles]]. He emphasizes that these developments represent a "flood" that has passed over humanity, occurring very recently within the lifetime of the speakers [00:04:02].

## Fundamental Shifts in Human Behavior and Society

### Reproductive Behavior
Historically, the basic behavior of almost all mammals is to reproduce as much as possible, with very few exceptions [00:02:10]. However, the human species has become an exception to this rule [00:02:25]. Globally, reproduction rates have dropped extraordinarily, with Niger being the only exception [00:05:22]. While the African continent and Asian continent continue to reproduce, their rates have also decreased compared to 10 and 20 years ago and are still declining [00:05:28]. One speaker views the rapid decline in the Western world as indicative of the "collapse, weakening and defeat of a cultural area" [00:06:16].

### Women's Status
When the speakers were born, the status of women was very similar to its condition 10,000 years ago, but it has since undergone an "extraordinary change" [00:02:51]. The advent of television, for instance, played a role in liberating women from the direct political influence of their fathers, granting them exposure to diverse political preferences [00:30:09].

### Economic Transformation and Consumption
The global economy has transitioned from a demand-pull model, where supply was insufficient, to a state where supply exceeds demand [00:03:07]. This shift led to the creation of entire sectors dedicated to generating demand [00:03:28]. Today, the production capacity exists to produce everything needed for all of humanity, but the capacity for organization is lacking [00:03:32]. While production capacity is sufficient to meet human needs, the necessity for humans to consume excessively is doubted, as much demand is a product of established [[power_dynamics_and_social_organization | social organization]] [00:09:00]. It is suggested that if a more reasonable social organization were established, humans would not need to consume as much [00:09:17].

## Societal Dynamics and Global Perspectives

### The "Flood" of Change
These fundamental changes, including the decrease in fertility and increase in production capacity, are attributed to the "ordinary decisions of ordinary people" over a long period, rather than a planned, top-down direction [00:23:01]. This perspective suggests that humanity has experienced a "great flood" that has invalidated previous concepts [00:08:15].

### Critique of Homogenization and Global Power
One speaker argues that [[Social and cultural dynamics in Trkiye | Türkiye]] would be a richer and more livable country if it respected regional differences instead of aiming for homogenization [01:16:42]. On a global scale, the idea of a single collective entity ruling the world is seen as a "terrible dictatorship" that must be prevented at all costs [01:33:19]. The speaker also views the Western world's efforts to homogenize global perspectives as a "risky thing" and a "danger" [01:17:27].

### Evolution and Spontaneous Order
A belief in "spontaneous organization and spontaneous order" is articulated, drawing parallels to how language and the human brain function [02:08:51]. These systems, though appearing chaotic, exhibit fascinating orders that are "more resistant and adaptable to changes than all the orders that we, as humans, have established with designs from above" [02:22:11]. This perspective trusts in human intelligence and the power of "the small and the ordinary" [00:54:07].

### Generational Differences in Worldview
Younger generations are perceived as less influenced by Cold War dynamics (e.g., US vs. Soviet Union) than older generations, who grew up with such narratives [01:11:11]. This difference in perception suggests that younger people may not interpret global tensions in the same "antique" terms [01:11:19].

## The Future of Society and Challenges

### The Employment Obsession
A significant societal problem highlighted is the "obsession with employment" [01:30:35]. While production capacity is immense, wealth creation is no longer directly tied to employment in the way it once was [01:31:00]. Many jobs, particularly those requiring a university degree, are considered "unnecessary" or "Kadan jobs"—meaning they could be automated or eliminated without significant loss [01:31:46]. This situation "castrates the human being" by forcing them into unproductive labor [01:31:11].

The proposed solution to this is to provide everyone with basic income and allow individuals to pursue their own desires, rather than forcing them into meaningless employment [01:34:16]. This contrasts with the idea of grand, purposeful projects (like building cathedrals or pyramids) being necessary for human endeavor, as spontaneous human action could lead to such achievements if people are liberated from unnecessary labor [01:34:45].

### [[Population control and Demographic challenges | Societal Aging]]
Europe, in particular, is noted for its aging population, which is seen as contributing to a society that prioritizes protecting the existing status quo over effort, vision, or new horizons [02:26:26].

### Hope for the Future
Despite challenges, there is hope that society is moving towards a more empowered individual [01:44:02]. It is believed that individuals can make more of their own decisions today compared to the past, and that the world is improving in this regard [01:44:06]. The speaker expresses optimism that society will find ways to overcome crises without resorting to war, potentially through the subtle shifts observed in response to events like the Covid-19 pandemic, which is viewed as having weakened central powers [01:27:13].

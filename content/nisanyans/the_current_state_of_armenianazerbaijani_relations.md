The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh is described as a great tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:43">[02:22:43]</a>. Approximately 120,000 people, almost 100% of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh, have left, concluding they cannot live under Azeri rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>. This departure signifies the end of the Armenian national existence in Nagorno-Karabakh, potentially for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:17">[02:23:17]</a>.

## Recent Diplomatic and Political Context

Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan had previously sought an alliance with America, a move initially criticized as "astonishing, shocking, stupid, incredibly stupid" and even "treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. However, upon calmer reflection, these judgments were deemed "hasty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>. Armenia's call for American help, while still considered "a masterpiece of stupidity" in some contexts, is primarily seen as perception management for the media, involving symbolic gestures like inviting Americans and attempting joint military exercises with the Texas National Guard, who are described as part-time soldiers like firefighters and police officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:39">[02:24:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:04">[02:25:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:16">[02:25:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:34">[02:25:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:48">[02:25:48]</a>.

Other symbolic actions include Armenia's discussion of recognizing the court that issued an arrest warrant for Putin, and Pashinyan's wife visiting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:58">[02:25:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:18">[02:26:18]</a>. These actions appear to be deliberate shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:34">[02:26:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:42">[02:26:42]</a>.

## The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War and Its Aftermath

Armenia suffered a heavy military defeat in 2020, where Azeri forces were close to occupying all of Nagorno-Karabakh within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:12">[02:27:12]</a>. The Azeris successfully captured surrounding regions, cutting off Nagorno-Karabakh's connection and communication lines with Armenia, and surrounded the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:40">[02:27:40]</a>. The capture of Shusha, a strategic city on a hill overlooking the region, was decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>.

Russia intervened at this point, providing a "decent interval" for the situation to cool down before Azerbaijan would eventually take full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>. It is understood that the Armenian, Turkish, Russian, and Azerbaijani governments were aware this outcome was inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:20">[02:28:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:29">[02:28:29]</a>. After 2020, there was no way for Armenia to retain Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:33">[02:28:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>.

The international community, including Russia, America, the European Union, and Iran, has recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory since 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:51">[02:28:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>. Therefore, Azerbaijan's actions, while described as "inhumane" and "sauced with rhetoric," are considered a "domestic security operation" under International Law, similar to Turkey's actions in Dersim (1938) or the Ağrı rebellion (1930) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:14">[02:29:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:27">[02:29:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:47">[02:29:47]</a>.

## Historical and Political Dynamics within [[Armenian history and geopolitical struggles | Armenia]]

Before the collapse of the Soviet Union around 1990, Armenia failed to gain international acceptance for its historical and demographic claims in Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:54">[02:29:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>. A rational policy at that point would have been to negotiate with the Azerbaijani government on the rights, security, and education of Armenians within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:39">[02:30:39]</a>. This did not happen, partly due to a lack of trust in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:42">[02:30:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.

In 1991, Armenia deported approximately 20% of its population, who were Azeri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:55">[02:30:55]</a>. This action "blocked the future" for the larger number of Armenians within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:11">[02:31:11]</a>. There was a mutual population exchange between the two regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:20">[02:31:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>.

Since 1991, militant cadres from Upper Karabakh have largely controlled Armenian politics, forming a team that significantly influenced domestic politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:33">[02:31:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:55">[02:31:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:10">[02:32:10]</a>. Their source of power is not fully known but includes connections to Russia and various income streams, allowing them to hold Armenia "captive" and "handcuff" it to their cause for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:18">[02:32:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:26">[02:32:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:53">[02:32:53]</a>. Pashinyan has faced challenges in taking necessary diplomatic steps due to the continued influence of these cadres, including figures like Kocharyan, who remains powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:59">[02:32:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:12">[02:33:12]</a>.

It is suggested that a "small positive result" or "consolation gift" from the recent tragedy could be the removal or marginalization of these "old Karabakh militant cadres" from [[Political and social issues in Turkey and Armenia | Armenian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:20">[02:33:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:27">[02:33:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:36">[02:33:36]</a>.

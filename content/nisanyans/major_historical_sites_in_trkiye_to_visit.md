For those interested in exploring historical sites in Trkiye, two locations are highlighted as particularly significant and surprising, offering unique insights into the nation's past and architectural traditions.

## Gallipoli (Çanakkale) War Monuments

The **Çanakkale War monuments** on the Gallipoli peninsula are described as "very surprising places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These are not merely a set, but rather a collection of cemeteries, including those of the British and Allied forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Historical Context and Appearance
These monuments were constructed between 1918 and 1923, during the Allied occupation of the Marmara Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. As per a treaty, Trkiye accepted the responsibility to protect and maintain them, even appointing a foreign manager and director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. They resemble 19th-century parks and cemeteries found globally, rather than typical parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The site contains 15-20 specific soldier graves, alongside a few Turkish monuments built at a later date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The speaker was "very impressed and surprised" upon their first visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne

The second significant place is the **Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This large Ottoman complex was built during the reign of Beyazıt II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> and includes a mosque, madrasah, and hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Architectural Significance
The complex's "geometry is very striking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, showcasing a "rational and completely totalitarian understanding of art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This aligns with the general characteristics of [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Ottoman architecture]] and high-period Islamic architecture, which is "extremely abstract, extremely rational, extremely geometric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. It is founded on creating complex structures from simple geometric forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The speaker suggests that it is one of the most interesting Ottoman works outside the capital, alongside the [[City histories in Turkey such as Tarsus and Merzifon | Sokullu complex in Payas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The Beyazidiye Complex makes visitors "feel the imperial power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> due to its scale and modern architectural understanding that avoids excessive ornamentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It represents a mathematical understanding of art as a display of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, showcasing a culture "very different from the culture that is sometimes defined among the public as backwards, ignorant, etc." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Viewing it can lead one to exclaim, "is it really like this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The complex is described as having a "bare naked" skeleton of Ottoman art, surprisingly rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. The speaker also mentioned that they had last visited 22-23 years prior, where it was surrounded by meadows and gardens, somewhat distant from the city center, and appeared to have been largely unvisited, with overgrown grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Russia's position and influence in international relations, particularly concerning ongoing and potential conflicts, have significantly evolved.

## The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Geopolitical Standing

The notion that the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics|Russia-Ukraine War]] was initiated to weaken or distract Russia before a larger conflict in the Middle East is dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. On the contrary, the aim of the conflict was not to wear down Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Currently, Russia is considered much stronger both militarily and diplomatically than it was two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

In the event of a significant war in the Middle East, the outcome would be largely determined by the stance of Russia and/or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. A decision by these two major powers to form an anti-American coalition would radically alter the global course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The possibility of Russia joining such a coalition is far stronger today than it was two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Russian Resilience and Military Development
Russia has demonstrated its economic and industrial viability, proving its ability to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Its army has gained considerable experience, overcoming initial mistakes and immaturity, as war serves as a training ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### International Relations and Alliances
Russia has significantly improved its international relations, strengthening ties with China, Arab countries, Africa, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. If any calculation was made to weaken Russia for a potential Middle East conflict, it appears to have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Historical Context and Geopolitical Influence

### Jewish Migration and Anti-Russian Sentiment
Anti-Russian sentiment among some Jewish communities in the USA is largely attributed to the effects of education and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. Historically, Jewish populations migrating from the old Russian Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries faced pogroms, oppression, and massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. However, the regions where most Jews lived and experienced such atrocities in Tsarist Russia are now largely within modern-day Ukraine and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. During World War I, Ukrainians, particularly Western Ukrainians, significantly participated in the massacre of Jews, despite Russians ultimately being seen as saviors of Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. Despite this, there is generally no hostility among Jews who migrated from the Soviet Union to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

### Influence over Turkic Republics
The Turkic Republics (Azerbaijan and Central Asian states) have long-standing, close ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. It is unlikely they will fully exit Russia's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Turkey cannot establish close relationships with these countries without considering the Russian factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Some Russian perspectives believe that Turkey's engagement with these countries is beneficial as it brings Turkey into Russia's sphere of influence and necessitates cooperation with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This perspective aligns with a Eurasianist thought system, which posits that the Eurasian continent blends Russian and Turkish elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

### Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia
Azerbaijan's claims on the Zangezur region in Southern Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, a mountainous area historically inhabited by Mountain Armenians and later Azeri Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>, highlight a complex geopolitical game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. If Azerbaijan were to attempt annexation with Turkey's cooperation, Iran would likely consider it an act of war and intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This creates a challenging three-sided dynamic between Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

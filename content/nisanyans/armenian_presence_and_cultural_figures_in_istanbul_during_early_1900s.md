The Deportation period, particularly the events of April 24, 1915, significantly impacted the Armenian community in Istanbul, although the deportation was not generally implemented there on a mass scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite the challenges, many Armenian families, like the one described, had lived in Istanbul for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and managed to continue their existence in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Impact of the Deportation (1915)

On April 24, 1915, as a first move of the Deportation in Istanbul, 150-200, 30-40 people were arrested and sent to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The vast majority of these individuals, except for a few, were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

One individual from the speaker's father's side was a writer and [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house]] owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This individual was a member of the cultural and intellectual life of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He was among 24 people arrested during that period, held for a while, and then released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Additionally, one of those exiled at the time hid in the grandfather's house for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Armenian Schools and Education

The Deportation had a significant [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | impact on education]] for Armenians in Istanbul. In 1915, all Armenian schools in Istanbul were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. As a result, the speaker's grandmother, who was fifteen years old and in middle school at the time, had to attend a different institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. She attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years, which led to her knowing French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Armenian schools were later reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Armenian Migration from Istanbul (1922)

In 1922, after the fall of Izmir, panic spread in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This led to France allowing the [[armenian_migration_from_istanbul_to_france_post1922 | mass migration of Armenians from Istanbul to France]] for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This mass migration, where Istanbul Armenians met with France en masse, did not occur in 1915 but rather in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Many Armenians, including the speaker's family, packed into ships and left in great panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Return and Cultural Contributions

The speaker's grandfather, along with other family members, went to France, but after staying in Paris for two to three years, he returned to Türkiye because there was no one to revive the old [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Before the migration, the grandfather had a [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house]] especially active in publishing security translations of famous modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Upon his return, the [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house]] was revived as a bookstore near Beyazıt Square, which is now home to the Faculty of Letters and Faculty of Chemistry of the current university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For years, until the 1950s, these bookstores and second-hand bookshops became some of Istanbul's most well-known, beloved, and key book establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

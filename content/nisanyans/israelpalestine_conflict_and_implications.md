The [[middle_east_conflicts_and_ceasefire_in_israel | Middle East]] is currently experiencing "very grave events," with the possibility of keeping the recent incident (October 7th) under control being weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. These events are perceived as "conscious," not merely random acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Root Causes and Geopolitical Shifts

A significant triggering event underlying the current situation was the reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which occurred approximately 5-6 months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This reconciliation is considered a "deadly danger" and an "arrow directed at the heart of [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. For years, the meaningless hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran was fostered by the United States and [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] to prevent any Muslim state from effectively challenging [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The destruction of Syria and Iraq, which were once seen as threats to [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]], increased Iran's influence in the region, including Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The coming together of Iran and Saudi Arabia represents a fundamental threat to Israel's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Israeli Strategy and the Gaza Operation

The current right-wing coalition government in [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]], led by Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to have planned the destruction of Gaza as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This strategy aims to prevent a diplomatic peace treaty that would be forced upon [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]], which is seen as an existential danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. The policy's goal is to destroy Gaza, deport its population to Egypt, and disperse its people, including to Europe and TÃ¼rkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### The October 7th Incident
The terrorist attack on October 7th is believed to have been a planned incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. It is argued that the Israeli army and its electronic surveillance systems would have been able to detect such an attempt from the border, implying that [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] knew about and was waiting for this attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

Claims of mass casualties, such as 260 people killed at a concert, are questioned due to a lack of visual evidence or reporting from journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Allegations of widespread rape lack evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, and reports of 40 children's heads being cut off originated from a fanatical Zionist propagandist and are not based on verifiable sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes and Regional Reactions

A ground operation in Gaza is anticipated to be very difficult, leading to serious bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. If Hezbollah intervenes militarily, the Israeli army would face significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Should Iran become involved in the war, a "great apocalypse" could ensue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. There are reports of serious resistance within the Israeli army regarding a ground operation in Gaza, which could impact internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Iran has stated to the United Nations that it will intervene if [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] does not stop its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. The possibility of a war between Iran and [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] is considered "very strong" if [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] does not soon halt its Gaza operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

### International Involvement
*   **United States:** The question remains whether the U.S. will be directly involved in such a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Russia:** [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia]] is not considered ready to enter another war due to its ongoing commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. While there is sympathy for [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] in [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia]] (being a sponsor of [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] since 1948 and having many dual citizens living there), [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia]] is unlikely to take an immediate stance. However, if Iran appears unable to manage the conflict alone, [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia]] will not allow Iran to be defeated by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **China:** China is also unlikely to allow Iran to be defeated by America, though this is a less certain prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## Israel's Existential Struggle
The existence of the State of [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] has been a struggle since its establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] lacks the luxury of defeat, as its very existence as a state would be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. This perception of having "nothing to lose" influences many of its seemingly incomprehensible domestic and foreign policy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. It is argued that [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] has never been closer to an existential crisis since 1948 than it is now, with Benjamin Netanyahu being held responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. The current Israeli leadership, characterized by "incomprehensible rage," "blinded aggression," and a "war ideology," promotes deep racism and disregards world public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

### Historical Context of Land Claims
The claim that [[palestine_and_israel_conflict | Palestinians]] sold their land to Jews is "terribly exaggerated and presented in a wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. While some Arabs did sell land, often large landowners in Lebanon or Syria, this was a small portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. In 1948, a large portion of land ownership in what is now [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] was in Arab hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. During the 1948 war, Israelis systematically attacked villages to force [[palestine_and_israel_conflict | Palestinians]] to flee, and these refugees were not allowed to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. A significant portion of Israel's lands was thus seized through "terror and pogroms," not purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.

The claim to land based on a 3,000-year-old presence is illogical for any national cause, but societies live by such myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. The perplexing aspect is that Western states, which claim to represent reason and law, accept this "absurd claim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. This acceptance is attributed to three factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>:
1.  Western guilt over the persecution of Jews in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.
2.  European anti-Semitism, an "Oh, let the Jews go away" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
3.  Interdependence and obligation relations between Jewish financial movements and Western states and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Demonstrations
Protests in London and Canada supporting [[palestine_and_israel_conflict | Palestine]] are notable, raising questions about potential uprisings of Arab citizens in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Anti-war demonstrations are generally ineffective today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. Demonstrations can work by influencing public opinion and, subsequently, election results. However, it is argued that modern democracies do not allow for election results to have significant political consequences, as policies are largely unaffected by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. The second possibility for a demonstration to be effective, overthrowing a government or regime (as seen in Iran in 1978), is now nearly impossible due to the capabilities and ideological formations of security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. Therefore, street demonstrations are considered symbolic acts with "no consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

## Global Conflict Risk
The possibility of a third World War has "increased dangerously in the last week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
An Arab League-versus-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]] conflict is unlikely, as the Arab world currently lacks the inclination, power, or military readiness for such a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.
A potential invasion of Taiwan by China is not indicated; China's approach focuses on preventing Taiwan from becoming a hostile military base and integrating it more closely economically, rather than invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. The war will not start over Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. A more serious possibility for conflict is over the Philippines or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

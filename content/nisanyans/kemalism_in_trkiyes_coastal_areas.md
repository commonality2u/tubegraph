Kemalism is widely prevalent in the coastal regions of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its spread, including in these areas, is attributed to three primary social groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Social Bases of Kemalism's Spread

### [[role_of_greek_immigrants_in_spreading_kemalism | Greek Immigrants]]
One significant social base for Kemalism's strength in coastal areas is the wave of [[role_of_greek_immigrants_in_spreading_kemalism | Greek immigrants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Over one million immigrants from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye and its neighbors | Greece]] arrived in Anatolia between 1878 and 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These populations were predominantly settled in the [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | Western parts of Türkiye]], forming an arc across the Marmara and [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Aegean Region]] (especially its coastal areas), and the Western and Central [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | Black Sea]] regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The Republican People's Party and Kemalist ideals hold strong appeal among these communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Educated Civil Servants
Another major segment contributing to Kemalism's presence in coastal areas consists of educated civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These individuals are considered educated by Türkiye's averages and often hold civil service positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Kemalism is particularly strong among them, serving as a class indicator that distinguishes them from the general populace, or "ignorant people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The career trajectory of civil servants in Türkiye often involves postings across the country, from Çorum to Diyarbakır or Denizli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, upon retirement, many choose to settle in coastal provinces like Izmir, Antalya, or Bursa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, these provinces have a high concentration of retired civil servants and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For this group, Kemalism provides a sense of elevated status, affirming their self-perception as more valuable than the average population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### [[migration_and_kemalist_ideology_among_alevis | Alevis]]
A third significant group supporting Kemalism, particularly in its modern interpretations, are [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Historically, the heartland of [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Alevis]] was in inner Eastern Anatolia, specifically in regions like Sivas, Malatya, and Tokat, where their population was dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

For [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis]], Kemalism has become a status symbol, especially today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. They see it as a means to assert their rightful place within the country and state, despite historical and ongoing marginalization by ideologies that ignore or exclude them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Since the 1980s, due to systemic oppression, many [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis]] have been compelled to leave their traditional homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. While some migrated to Europe, a substantial portion moved to large cities like Istanbul and Ankara, as well as the [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Aegean region]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In these new locations, often coastal or near-coastal, they continue to embrace Kemalist thought as a last resort against oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This perspective is considered understandable and humane given their circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Understanding why people align with Kemalism, or any other ideology, requires empathy and distance from internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, finding solutions for Türkiye to overcome its internal conflicts and ideological impasses requires a different perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

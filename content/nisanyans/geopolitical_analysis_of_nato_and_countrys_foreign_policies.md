## Finland, Sweden, and NATO Expansion

The desire of Finland and Sweden to join [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] is considered a "rare act of stupidity and madness" in the history of these two countries and the contemporary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Their prosperity and reputation over the last 80 years were attributed to their neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. It is argued that there is no indication of a security threat to these countries from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, and joining [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] would provide no serious military benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

These countries were reportedly forced to join [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] through blackmail and threats, by installing young, politically inexperienced individuals in their administrative cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] is characterized as a "backward alliance with a collapsing military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

### Turkey's Stance

[[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]], along with Hungary, initially resisted this expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] is seen as having "volunteered" to delay and prevent this "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. While [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] appears to have been "defeated regarding Finland," it continues its resistance concerning Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. The resistance shown by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's regime in this matter is considered commendable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

### Russia's Geopolitical Interests

The Baltic Sea is described as a vital region for Russia, serving as the sole exit for its significant industrial and population centers, including Petersburg and Northern Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. For 300 years, Russia's basic policy has been to control this route or ensure it is managed by friendly and neutral countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. The act of tightening control over this strait by arming the Baltic States with "irresponsible, nonsensical people" and bringing Finland into a hostile alliance is seen as "asking for trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Such actions "must be prevented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

## [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | The Ukraine War]]

Regarding [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | the Ukraine War]], there is significant "information pollution," with almost every statement from the Western press described as a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Russia generally does not provide information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Based on serious Western press, the Ukrainian army has been "destroyed," with over 200,000 casualties and significant desertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Russia's strategy appears to be focused on destroying the Ukrainian army rather than acquiring large areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Two trends are observed:
1.  The Ukrainian administration is increasingly pleading for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
2.  Western world enthusiasm for Ukraine has "collapsed like a balloon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, evolving into a sentiment of "Ugh, this annoying guys again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

It is predicted that if [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] forces intervene in Ukraine, it will lead to a "great disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Israeli Foreign Policy

Recent events indicate a potential shift in Israeli foreign policy. Historically, since 1956, Israel and America have seemed to diverge in foreign policy for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. In the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine-Russia conflict]], Israel surprisingly adopted a middle-of-the-road approach instead of aligning with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This stance, not following the path of its long-standing ally, the United States, has raised questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

Additionally, Israel's long-standing game plan of viewing Iran as an enemy, with American appeasement, has been challenged by the recent reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This reconciliation is considered one of the "most striking developments of recent years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, indicating a "radical change in the diplomatic balances of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. These shifts suggest that Israel may need "new horizons, new discourses and a new perspective in the outside world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

## [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey's Foreign Policy]]

The success of a country's foreign policy is ultimately determined "at the end of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>, which can be a long process. The attitude [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] has adopted in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] expansion debate is seen as a successful path, leading to [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]]'s voice being heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. However, the long-term benefits for the economy and military capacity remain to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

In [[geopolitical_shifts_in_the_21st_century_postsyria_conflict | Syria]], [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] is described as having "stepped on the wet plank in a very terrible way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. This situation was influenced by American allies and the foreign policy expert Ahmet Davutoğlu, who "dragged Tayyip Erdoğan and the entire government after ridiculous dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] has been "dragged into a swamp that it cannot win and save itself from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a> in [[geopolitical_shifts_in_the_21st_century_postsyria_conflict | Syria]] and will "sooner or later" have to leave "with its tail between its legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

## Historical Context: Armenian-Turkish Relations

During the early periods of the Committee of Union and Progress, there was "great sincerity, closeness, [and] cooperation" between exiled Turkish and Armenian intellectuals and activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. They formed a common group in parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>, and personal friendship and trust continued until 1915 in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

However, from 1909 onwards, the paths of the two groups began to diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. The Adana incidents in 1909, where a "terrible Armenian program organized by the state" resulted in tens of thousands killed, destroyed trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>. Armenians claimed the Progress administration made no effort to prevent these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>, while the Turkish government believed Armenians were secretly preparing for revolution and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. This mutual distrust led to a clash of ideologies: those who advocated for reform within the Ottoman Empire, and those who believed their only ally was Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. The latter group, the "Russianists," gained dominance in the party congress in November 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

Many Ottoman Armenians had Turkish as their mother tongue until the late 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. The revival of Armenian as a cultural language occurred through a "great educational campaign of the 19th century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. Until the end of the 18th century, Armenians rarely had surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>, but by the 1820s, most acquired Turkish surnames, often related to professions or personal characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>.

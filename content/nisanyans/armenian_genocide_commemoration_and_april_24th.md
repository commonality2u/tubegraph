From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

April 24th is commemorated globally, especially in Armenia, as the day of the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is a deeply emotional event in Armenia, with the entire population of the city walking to the monument on a hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While the speaker notes a change in their general attitude towards nationalist expressions, they emphasize that it is fundamentally a humanitarian event that affects people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Significance of April 24, 1915

April 24th is not directly related to the mass killings of the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] itself, but rather to a critical [[political_operations_and_impact_on_armenian_community | political operation]] that preceded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Understanding this political step is crucial to fully grasp the events that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Arrests of Armenian Intellectuals

On the night of April 24, 1915, approximately 235 to 250 prominent figures of the Armenian community in the Ottoman Empire were arrested in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These individuals included writers, intellectuals, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters—anyone known and influential in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants in a massive operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A few days later, some groups were sent to two places in Anatolia: Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While some managed to escape, many were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This [[political_operations_and_impact_on_armenian_community | operation]] was a "political collapse operation," a tactic often seen in the history of the Republic of Turkey and during the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The state would collect information, then suddenly sweep in to gather and remove people, regardless of their guilt or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly opposed to extremist nationalist Armenian movements, and many who had no connection to any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The prominent figures and leaders of society were gathered in the same manner, likened to the saying "dry and wet, dry and wet, day burns," meaning all are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Similar [[political_operations_and_impact_on_armenian_community | operations]] occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. In Sivas, prominent individuals were reportedly called to the governor's office, killed in a room, and thrown into waiting cars outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The clear intent of this "cleansing" was to eliminate political leaders and those who could raise their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## From Arrests to Massacres

Following the arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This incident gradually escalated into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Denial and Its Consequences

The speaker asserts that discussions about whether there was a [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] or not are a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. To deny the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is characterized as complete ignorance and immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This denial is likened to denying a clear historical fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The speaker states that there is no doubt in their mind about the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Everyone in the world, including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, acknowledges this obvious fact, with the exception of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The Turkish state, for various reasons, began designing a [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] project as early as 1895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. From 1913, it consciously and systematically prepared the infrastructure, implementing it in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the Armenian population, the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Denying this is seen as either ignorance or immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Turkey's Historical Stance on the Genocide

The [[turkeys_historical_and_political_stance_on_the_armenian_genocide | Turkish state]] had a different policy on the subject of [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] until 1975, primarily one of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Especially until 1965, Turkey did not feel the need to engage in discussions about the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Spokespeople and representatives of the Republic of Turkey acknowledged the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] but believed it was unnecessary to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The issue resurfaced globally in 1965, marking its 50th anniversary, primarily initiated by the Soviet Union and Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Despite some murmurs in Turkey under Demirel's governments, Turkey maintained its policy of silence, likely due to its high reputation and protection in the Western world at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

However, after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974 or 1975, the issue suddenly erupted in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. An organization named ASALA emerged, launching attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Subsequently, the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] was suddenly "remembered" across the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

At this point, Turkey adopted a policy of denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This systematic denial, articulated by figures like Coşkun Kırca and Aktan, has trapped Turkey in a position from which it has been unable to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. The speaker considers this policy a "fiasco" that became clear in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Turkey's loss of international standing after 1974, particularly with the Cyprus incident, led to a strong anti-Turkey sentiment in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Turkey's "impudence" and "rudeness" in denying a widely known historical crime provided an excuse for the world to provoke and hurt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Turkey has suffered from this "stupid policy" for decades, unable to show the foresight to step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## A Window of Hope (2005-2011)

Between 2005 and 2011, a brief "window of hope" emerged for Turkey to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. A great hope was born within Turkey, across both right and left-wing factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Mainstream media outlets like Radikal, Milliyet, Hürriyet, and even Yeni Şafak (an Islamic publication that was balanced at the time) began advocating for confronting the incident and moving past it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. For the first time, the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] incident was genuinely discussed in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Many opinion leaders and sane individuals from both sides acknowledged the terrible events, regardless of whether they explicitly used the term "genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. They recognized that millions of Armenians, "the real children of this country," suffered, and Turkey too was harmed by this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Even if not harmed, it was a shameful incident that Turkey could have acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

Had Turkey shown the courage to take this step, it would have shed a heavy burden of hypocrisy and taken a step towards overcoming the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] incident that has been an obsession and mental illness for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The speaker himself struggled for Turkey to confront this issue until around 2014, believing it was essential for Turkey's health as a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## The Armenian Genocide's Impact on Turkey

The [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] is considered the most important social and political event of the 20th century in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. It fundamentally changed the color and composition of Turkish society and serves as the psychological and economic basis for its political transformation and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Beyond Armenians, the cleansing of Greek and Assyrian populations in different dimensions constitutes Turkey's greatest trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Historical Context and Union and Progress Policies

The idea of cleansing non-Muslim populations was advocated since the 1890s during Abdulhamid's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. While the [[union_and_progress_administration_and_the_armenian_genocide | Union and Progress administration]], upon coming to power in 1908, initially had an optimistic approach to overcoming these problems, they gradually returned to Abdulhamid's mentality and program by 1909-1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. The [[union_and_progress_administration_and_the_armenian_genocide | Union and Progress Party]], which initially worked with Armenian parties, shifted its stance after the Adana events of 1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. By 1910-1911, the belief emerged that a "new Turkey" could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

After the Balkan War and a period of chaos in 1912-1913, the [[union_and_progress_administration_and_the_armenian_genocide | Union and Progress cadres]] regained power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. By 1915, all plans for the conscious and resolute project of cleansing Anatolia of its non-Muslim population were ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

### The Problem of Armenian Deportation and "No Place to Go"

While the expulsion of Turks from Rumelia and Circassians from the Caucasus involved mutual population exchanges, making resettlement relatively easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, there was no place for Armenians to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Deporting Armenians to a neighboring country like Russia during World War I would have been disastrous for the Ottoman Empire, effectively giving material to the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Given the high probability of defeat in World War I and the potential loss of territories like Erzurum and Van, there was no safe place to deport them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Initially, the idea arose to deport Armenians to Syria, assuming Russia would leave the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. However, the situation quickly got out of hand, and it became clear this was not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. The only perceived solution became "cleansing" and massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. The underlying concern was that after the war, regardless of the outcome, Armenians would return seeking compensation, their lands, houses, and possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. To prevent this, the mass killings occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes the need to face the facts of the thousands killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. A healthier and calmer historical discussion is only possible when all sides, including Balkan countries, Western countries, and Germany, are considered rational players with their own concerns and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. However, as long as denial persists, productive discussion is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. While the world has moved on, using the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] as a "stick to poke Türkiye," Turkey missed an opportunity to open new paths and horizons by not confronting its past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

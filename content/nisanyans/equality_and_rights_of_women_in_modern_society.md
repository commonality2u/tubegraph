The discussion around the [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | rights]] and [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | equality]] of [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] in modern society often raises questions about historical patterns and underlying biological factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Representation in Various Fields

Historically, and in various cultures including ancient, Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean, American Native, and [[role_and_perception_of_islam_in_modern_society | Islamic]] cultures, there has been a notable scarcity of [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] in fields such as arts, visual arts, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While there are some exceptions, such as "good writers" or "a class of geniuses" from [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] in certain fields, these are presented as few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The speaker states that this phenomenon is generally consistent even when opportunities are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The idea that this lack of representation is solely due to oppression or male domination is explicitly dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Biological and Psychological Differences

A core argument presented is that [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] and men possess different biological functions and genetic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This difference is said to lead to varying psychological advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The fundamental [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | biological function of women]] is identified as giving birth and ensuring the child's safety and well-being, including looking after and feeding the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Conversely, men are suggested to have compensated for their biological dysfunctions or weaknesses in the biological field by developing skills and ambitions in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This perspective draws parallels to the animal kingdom, particularly mammals, where the functions of males and females are described as "very obvious and very logical" due to biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Humans are characterized as not being "very different creatures from monkeys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, with social organization being likened to "decorations" added to an animalistic base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The primary function of a human being is posited as sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, where the capabilities of [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] and men are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Debating [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | Equality]] in Modern Society

In contemporary society, where functions have become complex and "unnatural," the extent to which [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] should be granted certain [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | rights]] and the "degree of [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | equality]]" they should have are presented as matters that require discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that these are "things that need to be discussed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that the current age often prioritizes "ideological lies" over "objective truths," implying that these biological facts may be overlooked or dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

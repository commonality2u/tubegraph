A notable bilingual publication about Eastern Anatolia was released in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The author described it as one of their favorite books and among their top 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The book was written with great pleasure, requiring six years of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Book Structure and Purpose

The book is bilingual, with one side in Turkish and the other in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, the Turkish and English versions are not identical; they are approached as "two different books with two different approaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Turkish title translates to "Turkey East of Ankara: A Trip for Eastern Turkey is Rejected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The differing approaches for the Turkish and English versions stem from addressing two different groups of people, acknowledging their distinct prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The author aimed to present the "extraordinarily troublesome subject" of Eastern Turkey without overly disturbing or scaring anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Content and Research

The book contains information about the [[historical_ethnic_structure_of_eastern_anatolia | ethnic structure]] and [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | cultural structure]] of the region in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The research for the book involved extensive travel to Eastern Anatolia over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The author visited numerous places, including villages in Kars and Arda, and scrutinized districts, villages, and governorships in Hakkari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They also traveled to Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and the northern parts of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

During these trips, the author engaged in conversations with many people, including villagers, cultured individuals from the region, and officials like gendarmerie and police station commanders, listening intently to understand and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Historical Observations

From this extensive research, the author clearly perceived several historical patterns in Eastern Anatolia:
*   Until the early 20th century, major cities primarily had a [[historical_ethnic_structure_of_eastern_anatolia | Turkish]]-speaking population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For example, in the 1910s, there was "no trace of Kurds" in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   In Diyarbakır's center, both Kurdish and Turkish were spoken, but the major families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   The Ottoman ruling class was cosmopolitan, with diverse origins (e.g., Albanian, Georgian, Circassian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Individuals who migrated to cities, received an education, and entered the state mechanism automatically became "Turks" and adopted Turkish language and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Non-Muslims, particularly Armenians, undertook most urban services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. In early 20th-century Van, about half the population was Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In Diyarbakır, over half the population was Turkish-governed, with 20-30% Armenian and some Assyrian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Mardin's ruling class was Christian, and the city's language was Arabic, though ruling families considered themselves Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Many Turkish families in these cities had Armenian grandmothers or great-aunts, indicating close intermarriage and intertwining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   The elimination of the Armenian population had "unexpected results" for Turks, making cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin "uninhabitable" in terms of services like dentists, tailors, or insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The groups that provided cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Post-Republic Changes

During the Republic period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities dwindled as their children were sent to Ankara and Istanbul for education and often did not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This led to the gradual collapse and decay of these cities until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

From the 1960s onwards, as the economy developed, a significant [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration]] from villages to cities occurred, gradually leading to the [[turkish_and_kurdish_relations_in_modern_eastern_anatolia | Turkification]] of cities in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. However, this trend eventually shifted. By the 1970s and 80s, when the author first visited Mardin, there was no trace of Kurds in the city center, which was largely Arab and Arabic-speaking, while the rural areas were Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The city's inhabitants resisted Kurdish migration, leading to the growth of Kızıltepe, a Kurdish city 20 kilometers away, which became larger than Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Eventually, this resistance collapsed, and Kurds became the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Today, Diyarbakır is 80-90% Kurdish, and Van is overwhelmingly Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The author states that the "greatest success" of the Republican regime in Eastern Turkey has been the complete [[turkish_and_kurdish_relations_in_modern_eastern_anatolia | Kurdishization]] of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While Kurds were a numerous element previously, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Now, they are almost homogeneously dominant in their own region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This demographic shift has created social demands that the author believes are "impossible to prevent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Language and Identity

The author argues that while Turkish is currently the official language, Kurdish should also be recognized and taught in schools, spoken on the streets, and used in government offices and broadcasting, as it is the dominant language of a nearly 20 million population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. They believe it is impossible to suppress a language spoken with pride by such an overwhelming majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. It is an "indisputable fact" that everyone living in the region, including Turks, must learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Delaying this recognition would only lead to trouble and an "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

The region now has a homogeneous Kurdish population of approximately 20 million, with 87-90% dominance in their own area, possessing their own language and "organic intellectuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The author contends that it is no longer feasible to deny their identity or confine them to a "home element" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Geopolitical Considerations

The author also touches upon geopolitical aspects related to the region, noting that while establishing an independent Kurdish state appears difficult due to international conjuncture and the significant military power disparity with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, certain powers might benefit from Turkey losing control in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Russia, historically viewing Turkey as a threat due to its NATO inclusion, would benefit from Turkey's division, especially in areas closer to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Syria and Iraq could also benefit from the creation of a "Kurdistan and several Kurdistans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. However, the United States is unlikely to abandon or disintegrate Turkey, a vital partner and ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

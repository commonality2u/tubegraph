The situation in [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] is considered a turning point in the [[middle_east_geopolitical_tensions_involving_israel_and_trkiye | Middle East War]] and a key factor in broader global instability with a high probability of evolving into war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] holds a critical position, acting as a key to the Middle East, Israel, and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Current Developments in Syria

At this stage, there is insufficient information regarding the full scope of recent incidents in [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Reports suggest the capture of Aleppo and its airports, with an attack launched towards Hama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It will take several days for the situation to clarify due to widespread propaganda and fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Syria's Geopolitical Importance

[[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]]'s strategic location makes it vital for several regional and global powers:

*   **For Iran:** [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] serves as Iran's gateway to the Mediterranean for both trade and military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The fall of [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] would mean Iran's condemnation to the Asian steppes, leading to its encirclement and potential defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **For Russia:** The loss of [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] would severely damage [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]]'s claim to be a global power and would end its only base and support in the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It would also mean [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] loses the opportunity to "stab [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] in the back" in a potential future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **For China:** The potential fall of Iran, which is heavily reliant on [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] for access, poses a vital and fatal danger to China, as approximately 80% of its oil production comes directly from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It would mean China's hands are tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Israel's Strategy in the Region

The Israeli War, which began with the aim of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, has expanded to include resistance movements in the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> and major operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Eliminating or controlling the [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syrian]] factor is seen as crucial for neutralizing Hezbollah, as it would severely restrict military aid to the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

The United States, NATO, and Israel are systematically working to neutralize imminent dangers and destroy [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]], which is perceived as the source of these dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Israel's goal is not to establish a "Greater Israel" by invading neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Instead, it aims to reduce the Arab population within its borders and create a circle of "drugged states" that are militarily weak and non-threatening to Israel's diplomatic, military, commercial, and financial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This strategy involves breaking the backs of forces supporting Palestinian resistance, such as Iran, the [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syrian]] regime, and Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s Unexpected Alignment

A shocking development is [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s open and radical entry into the war as an ally of Israel and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This comes despite President Erdoğan's previous anti-Israeli rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Turkey]] has taken an active role on the [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syrian]] front, which is vital for Israel, utilizing elements it has trained and managed for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

This alignment raises questions about the control of [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s armed forces and [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Syria]] policy, suggesting that forces beyond Erdoğan's control might be at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

One analysis suggests [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s move in [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] is to pressure Bashar al-Assad to negotiate, as he has consistently rejected talks while [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] maintains an illegal presence in [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, this analysis is deemed incorrect, as it ignores the overarching strategies of Israel and the US in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] is not an independent player but has intervened in "someone else's war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Another theory, that [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] is being prepared for a US withdrawal from [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]], is dismissed as unrealistic. The US is not expected to withdraw from the Middle East without suffering a heavy defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

The price offered to [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] for its participation might be control over Northern [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]], potentially forming a self-governing entity similar to the TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Implications for Russia and China

The fall of [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] would signify a defeat for [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]], eliminating its military and diplomatic presence in the Middle East and Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. If [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] allows this, it would mark the end of Putin and [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] as a global power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The Western alliance is seemingly pushing [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] to make a countermove, believing its military power is a "paper tiger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

For China, the fall of [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syria]] and then Iran would be a disaster, jeopardizing its energy supply, as most of its oil comes from the Middle East, especially Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. It is argued that [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] and China will have to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## Deteriorating Russia-Turkey Relations

[[geopolitical_developments_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s alignment with the US and Israel has caused a significant backlash in [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]], with a storm of hostility against [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]] observed in [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russian]] social media and news sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This marks a shift from [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s previous "slippery and uncertain" policy of maintaining good relations with both [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. The long-term implications of [[trkiyes_foreign_policy_and_syria | Turkey]] joining forces with Americans and Israelis to overthrow the [[syrias_political_situation_and_international_interventions | Syrian]] regime are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

The situation is further complicated by [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_Trkiye | Turkey]]'s relationship with the Kurdish formation in Rojava, which is described as a "puppet of the Americans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This entire geopolitical equation has become "incredibly complicated and inextricably complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

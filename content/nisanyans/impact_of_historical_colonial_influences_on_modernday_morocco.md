Morocco exhibits a blend of traditional and modern elements, with significant [[colonialism_and_its_longterm_effects | historical colonial influences]] evident in its contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The impact of French rule, lasting 40-50 years, is particularly notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Linguistic and Administrative Legacy

French is widely spoken throughout Morocco, and official signs and offices predominantly use French, often not even Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This linguistic dominance is a direct trace of the [[colonialism_and_its_longterm_effects | colonial period]], manifesting as a "European polish" on the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Modernity and Urban Development

Morocco's modern urban areas, particularly cities like Rabat, exhibit a striking resemblance to Europe, being clean, orderly, and contemporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The presence of all conveniences and commercial services typical of modern life is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The efficiency of the municipality in maintaining cleanliness is evident, even in intricate old neighborhoods, making it a cleaner country than [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Türkiye]], Egypt, or Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This aspect of [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | modern]] development can be partly attributed to its [[colonialism_and_its_longterm_effects | colonial history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Preservation of Traditional Social Order

Despite the colonial influence, many dimensions of Morocco's traditional social order have been preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Unlike [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Türkiye]], Morocco's old cities, such as Marrakech and Fez, are remarkably large and have maintained their historical character without significant modern architectural interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. In rural areas, particularly in the south, lifestyles from centuries ago continue to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This suggests that while there is a modern facade, traditional life persists, creating a social spectrum that has "set foot in the 21st century less than Türkiye" in some aspects, yet is "a few steps ahead" in others regarding [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | modernity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Craftsmanship in Fez Bazaar
The Fez Bazaar stands out as a unique historical market where traditional craftsmanship remains actively practiced, unlike in [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Türkiye]] where crafts are largely defunct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Artisans in Fez produce high-quality handmade goods, including carpentry, tiles, lamps, and leather items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This vibrant artisan tradition reflects a continued link to historical practices, though the average age of craftsmen is over 50, indicating a potential decline in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Political and Social Dynamics

The [[political_and_social_dynamics_in_morocco_and_similar_regions | political and social dynamics in Morocco]] also reflect a unique post-colonial state. Slogans like "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (God, the Homeland, the King) are ubiquitous, and there is widespread public affection for the King, whose photographs adorn businesses, government offices, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Older, more conservative generations express only positive sentiments about the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

An interesting [[political_and_social_dynamics_in_morocco_and_similar_regions | social equivalence]] is observed between "fanatic Kemalists" in [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Türkiye]] and "fanatic kings" in Morocco, particularly among middle-class, modern, secular-leaning women aged 30-40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This parallel suggests that the fervor directed towards the state's founding ideology in [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Turkey]] is directed towards the monarchy in Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This phenomenon highlights how different post-colonial state structures can shape public loyalty.

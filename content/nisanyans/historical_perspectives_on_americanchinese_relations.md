## Introduction
The relationship between [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | America]] and [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] is a "very concerning issue" that involves serious negotiations and political meetings regarding the "fate of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Recent discussions between the two nations are largely undisclosed in the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: Henry Kissinger's Role
Within the [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] administration, there are "one or two very rare people" whom the [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | Chinese]] trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. One such figure is Henry Kissinger, who was the architect of peace between [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] and the United States in 1972-73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. He served as the national security advisor at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Kissinger played a foundational role in the transformation of the United States, which led to the separation of [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] from its alliance with the Soviets and fostered close cooperation with the United States for the following 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

More recently, Kissinger has been arguing "very strongly" since the last year and a half that [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | America]]'s Russia policy is wrong and that the war in Ukraine was a "major diplomatic blunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. He continues to highlight the dangers of a radical deterioration in relations with [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Despite being 100 years old, Kissinger traveled to [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] to potentially resolve or soften the current crisis, or to convey veiled threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Economic Tensions
The main battlefield between the United States and [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] appears to be the dumping of dollar bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] is a significant holder of [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] debt, estimated at trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Historically, [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] has purchased [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] bonds and held them as reserves and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. However, in recent months, [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] has systematically begun to divest itself of these bonds, a process also adopted by many other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This action is expected to lead to a "huge Financial crisis" and the collapse of the dollar if it reaches a "burdensome point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Alignments and Risks
An alliance consisting of Russia, [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]], Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Iran is systematically working towards this target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This is seen as an act that the United States would never accept or "digest," making it a "real cause for war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. If [[geopolitical_tensions_involving_taiwan_and_china | China]] were to collapse the dollar, the direct response would be war, as "there is no other way out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This indicates a "very serious crisis" in relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Critique of Post-1991 [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] Foreign Policy
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a faction within the United States government developed a vision of establishing a "Universal administration" and a "galactic Confederation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This included the belief in the "end of history" and the arrival of an era of "eternal administration of [[historical_perspectives_on_freedom_and_democracy | liberal democracy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The idea was that [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | America]] would integrate people from "every tribe, every race and everything from every country" into its system, working for a "common humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

However, the cadres who embraced this vision came to power from the late 1990s and "ruthlessly destroyed the obstacles in front of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. They consolidated their power through various means, leading to a situation where "the world is facing a disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The pursuit of such absolute power transforms individuals into "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The United States and its allies have fallen into this "terrible trap," and there is a pressing need for humanity to be saved from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## The West's Current Trajectory
The path taken by the [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | West]], particularly in the last three years, is seen as "madness" and a culture that has "gone astray from its roots" and entered a "period of suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:25">[01:48:25]</a>. This trajectory is not believed to be influenced or encouraged by external enemies like Russia, as they lack the power or benefit from such a human tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.

A question is raised regarding the connection between this situation and the [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western]] world's abandonment of [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | religion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>. It is suggested that there is a "serious connection" between abandoning [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | religion]] and these current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>. The decline of [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | religious]] institutions, particularly the Church's failure to act as a "moral objection to the state" during crises like the Covid pandemic, is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:22">[01:55:22]</a>. The "collapse" of the [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western]] world is seen as information that will reach [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Turkey]] with a delay of three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.

## Kurdish Presence in Anatolia

The ancestors of modern Kurds are likely related to two tribes: the Medes and the Kardu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. These groups spoke similar or Western Iranian languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

### The Medes
Around 500 BC, the Medes established an empire, briefly dominating large parts of modern-day Iran, Iraq, and Eastern Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. After their defeat, the Medes continued as a kingdom in western Iran and the historical Azerbaijani region for centuries, even under Persian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. Within present-day Turkey, their presence is evidenced in areas like Gürpınar, Başkale, southern Van, and the Hoşap region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. There are also indications of Medes settling in Ardahan and Göle, forming a principality subject to the Armenian Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

### The Kardu
Ancient Greek sources repeatedly mention a tribe called "Kardi" or "Kardu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. This tribe inhabited regions in southeastern Turkey, specifically north of today's Cilo Mountain, in the Şırnak town area, and around Hakkari, Beytüşşebab, Uludere, and Şemdinli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. The Kardu tribe has been present in these regions since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. They generally did not submit to external powers but also did not engage in empire-building or expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

### Emergence of "Kurds" in the Islamic Period
Towards the end of the 9th century, and more significantly at the beginning of the 10th century, a political formation referred to as "Kurd" by Arabs, Armenians, and Greeks emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This new formation appeared outside the traditional Mede and Kardu areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>.

The Mervanis, defined as "Kurds" and "Kurdistan" in both Armenian and Byzantine sources, established a principality in Silvan, Diyarbakır (west of the Tigris) around 900-950 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Simultaneously, some groups from the Deylem region (south of the Caspian Sea in Iran) engaged in raids, establishing local sovereignties in areas like Eğil District of Diyarbakır and possibly Bingöl, where the Zaza language is prevalent today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>.

The "Kurd" name emerged with the Mervani Principality and its founder, Baz, approximately 100 years before the arrival of the Turks in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. This implies that there were "Kurds" in Anatolia before the Turks, refuting the claim that there were none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. The Turks arrived later, as "guests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.

## Historical Narratives and the Karamanids

The question of historical origins, especially concerning groups like the Karamanids, is often fraught with what is perceived as fabricated nationalistic narratives in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

### The Karamanid Principality
The founder of the Karamanid Principality, Nure Sufi, was claimed by some to be of Armenian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This claim, though potentially a smear campaign by enemies like the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>, is supported by several historical sources:
*   **Hammer's history**: Explicitly states Nure Sufi was of Armenian origin and became a fanatic member of the Baba Ishak uprising, taking part in an Islamic rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Hammer cites Mustafa Efendi's history (written in 1588) as a source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.
*   **Gelibolulu Mustafa Ali's history**: Similarly states Nure Sufi was of Armenian origin and a convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **Karamani Mehmet Efendi's history**: Karamani Mehmet Efendi, Grand Vizier to Fatih Sultan Mehmet in 1479-80, also writes that Nur Sufi was of Armenian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Ebü Fida el-Hamavi's *Concise History of Humanity***: A 13th-century descendant of the Ayyubids and governor of Hama, Ebul Fida also records Nure Sufi as of Armenian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. He further states that Nure Sufi's son, Karaman, worked as a coal miner in Ermenek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

However, sources like Sempad Constable's detailed history (written around 1270 CE), which chronicles battles against Karaman, do not mention an Armenian origin, which might be expected if it were true and meant to defame him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

### Official Turkish Historical Narratives
Modern Turkish history often presents a "cliché story" about Nure Sufi, claiming he descended from the Avshar Turks and came from Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. This narrative suggests he was a brave man who initially served the Seljuks but declared independence when they became subject to the Mongols, stating "I, as a Turk, will never tolerate such a thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. This story is considered fabricated, lacking historical sources from the period of Nure Sufi's life (1230s-1250s) or later Ottoman eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. It is viewed as an example of how history in Turkey is written to fit nationalistic, racial, and Central Asian discourses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

The concept of a "lie-finding" approach is recommended when researching history in Turkey, especially given the "propaganda of idealist writers and the lies of the republican period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. This involves:
*   Assuming the author is lying and testing every claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   Checking multiple sources, including those with opposing viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   Knowing multiple foreign languages to access diverse sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   Always questioning the source of information: "where do we know these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

## Other Relevant Historical Events

### Musa Dagh Resistance and Armenians in Iskenderun
The novel "40 Days on Musa Dagh" by Franz Werfel (written around 1920) is highly recommended for its account of Armenian resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>. In 1915, seven Armenian villages on the slopes of Musa Dagh (in Samandağ district, Hatay) resisted deportation orders for 40 days against the Ottoman army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>. Survivors were eventually rescued by a French warship and transported to a refugee camp in Alexandria, Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. Some later returned. As of the early 1980s, only Vakıflı Village, an Armenian village, remained in Musa Dagh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>. The Armenians of Samandağ speak a unique dialect of Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>.

In the broader Iskenderun district, particularly Dörtyol and Payas, there was a significant Armenian population, many of whom were 19th-century immigrants from eastern provinces to Cilicia and the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:39">[02:01:39]</a>. In 1909, social tensions led to a major pogrom and massacre against Armenians in the Adana and Iskenderun districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>. Dörtyol, where two-thirds of the population was Armenian before 1909, was largely ruined, with survivors scattering or migrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:35">[02:02:35]</a>. These events occurred six years before the 1915 deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:10">[02:03:10]</a>.

### Ottoman History and Coups
The history of the Ottoman Empire, especially in its later years, is marked by numerous coups. Six out of the last nine Ottoman sultans were overthrown by coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>:
*   Selim III: Dethroned by a coup and executed a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.
*   Mustafa IV: Dethroned by a coup and executed immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:27">[01:41:27]</a>.
*   Abdülaziz: Dethroned by a coup and died suspiciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>.
*   Murad V: Dethroned by a coup and imprisoned for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>.
*   Abdülhamid II: Dethroned by a coup and imprisoned for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.
*   Vahdettin: Forced to flee the country in a manner akin to a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.

This pattern suggests a high probability (around 66-67%) of a new sultan being overthrown by a coup based on past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:13">[01:42:13]</a>.

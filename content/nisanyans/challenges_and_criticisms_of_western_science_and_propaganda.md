## Evolution of Scientific Trust: From Enlightenment to Modernity

The speaker critiques the long-held belief, prevalent from the early 1700s to the late 1900s, that reason and science are the sole guides to truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This perspective, common among the enlightened and educated, stemmed from humanity's perceived incredible advancements once freed from superstitions and dogmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The scientific outlook was seen as indisputably superior to rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

However, the speaker argues that this view is no longer viable today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. The concept of "leadership of science" has evolved to mean trusting certain individuals and their argumentation styles, rather than independent verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The assumption of high morality and inherent truthfulness of scientists, once taken for granted for 200 years, is now questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

### The Turning Point: Science as a Tool of the State

A significant shift occurred in the latter half of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. During the last months of World War II, the United States initiated an unprecedented project: the establishment of the Institute of Advanced Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. This institution gathered top scientists with unlimited funding to research various subjects for the benefit of the state, including armament, the atomic bomb, ballistic missiles, and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

This marked a breaking point in the history of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. While some scientists like Einstein critically compromised their principles, others faced deep moral conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Since the late 20th century, science has increasingly become a tool of state propaganda and a servant of the state's power game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The lines between science and propaganda have blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

Furthermore, scientific research has become extraordinarily expensive, shifting from individual scientists like Newton or Galileo to "science officers" requiring billions of dollars in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This leads to a world where the institutions funding the research have rights over the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Consequently, "trust in science" is now seen as no different from "trust in priests or teachers" of a previous era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

This shift has created a climate where people "groping in the dark trying to find the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. Many sense that information from media and institutions is not genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This leads some to embrace [[conspiracy_theories_and_authority | conspiracy theories]], some to despair, and others to esoteric beliefs or new religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

> "As we have seen in many cases such as the imposition and pumping of various health fashions in the global warming incident and the like, a reliable guide has now emerged. A true guide has emerged. It is a very sad thing today. Those responsible for this should be punished before history. They should be held accountable for this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>

### Distinguishing Propaganda from Information

To distinguish propaganda from real information, several approaches are suggested:
*   **Employ reason, logic, and rationality:** These are crucial tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Question contradictions:** Ask if what is being said holds together or contradicts known facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Be skeptical of dominant media:** Assume that "nothing said in the dominant media is honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.
*   **Read and discuss widely:** This helps understand different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.
*   **Understand the "players":** Recognize the mindsets, strategies, goals, and weaknesses of those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This requires time and reading, and ideally, interacting with people in decision-making positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

## Western Foreign Policy and Power Dynamics

The speaker heavily criticizes the "Western world that is sinking before our eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, comparing its decline to the collapse of the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In this context, Turkey's policy of maintaining relative independence and distance is deemed the most important goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

A prominent example of Western power dynamics is seen in the global infrastructure development landscape. The speaker notes that massive infrastructure projects worldwide are typically led by China, funded by generous loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. Large administrative investments and real estate speculation often involve Saudi, Qatari, or UAE capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>, or Russian oligarchs for more modest projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

Conversely, Europeans are described as "bankrupt since 2008," with "nothing to offer to other countries" beyond chain markets and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. They are portrayed as stingy and focused on short-term profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. The United States, according to the speaker, primarily "sells weapons" and offers "no other benefit to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

This perspective leads to a strong criticism of those who, when considering international aid or cooperation for Turkey, only list Western countries such as the USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. The speaker highlights the ignorance of such a list, which fails to include any non-Western countries as potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### The Ukraine War and German-Russian Relations

The Ukraine war is presented as a central arena for understanding [[perspectives_on_western_alliances_and_propaganda | Western Alliances and Propaganda]]. The speaker claims that the war is "not about Ukraine" but fundamentally "about Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. The core issue is Germany's potential natural partnership with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Germany desires to sell its high-tech products to the Russian market and purchase Russia's abundant natural resources (oil, natural gas, water, metals) at a cheap price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>, as Germany lacks these resources itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.

After the Cold War, the natural evolution was for Europe, especially Germany, and Russia to integrate, with Russia becoming "a natural and essential member of the European community of nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Both Russia and Germany were ready for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.

However, the United States perceived this potential alliance as "the biggest threat to its world domination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. The US explicitly stated it would "not allow this under any circumstances" and acted to sabotage it, which ultimately led to the Ukrainian War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. The destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline is implicitly cited as part of this sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.

The speaker assesses the war's outcome after a year:
*   The Ukrainian army has been destroyed, and its infrastructure devastated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>. Ukrainian cities are uninhabitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>.
*   Ukraine has suffered massive losses, estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.
*   Russia's stated goals of "denazification and demilitarization" (removing Ukraine's dangerous military capacity and NATO-trained fascist militia groups) appear to have been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.
*   The declared American goals of disintegrating Russia, changing its regime, and destroying its economy have not seen "the slightest success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>. The Russian economy performed better than Western European countries, with higher growth rates, and its international diplomatic position has strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

The speaker concludes that Europe is "going downhill like a truck whose brakes have failed, towards collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Russia's strategy in this war is to save its future, not just to win battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. They are fighting "a life and death struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. The speaker also suggests that cornering a cat is dangerous; it is crucial to leave an escape route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. This means giving Ukrainians a chance to solve their problems, rather than a full military occupation, to avoid further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>.

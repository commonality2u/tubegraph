The discussion explores the [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | concept and evolution of freedom]], examining both its theoretical definitions and practical manifestations across different historical periods and societies, along with [[the_evolution_and_future_of_democracy_and_capitalism | perspectives on democracy]].

## Definitions of Freedom

A "moral freedom" is described as the ability of a person to form their own value judgments by their own will and live accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. "Political freedom" is defined as the ability to change or at least limit the political power one is affiliated with by one's own choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

However, it is argued that the concept of an individual freely choosing value judgments is largely a Hollywood movie construct, with no such person existing in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. Value judgments are seen as a vectorial result of upbringing, accidents, fate, coincidences, and societal currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. People often convince themselves of free choice to justify their pre-existing attitudes, which are influenced by instincts, conditions, and social obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

Similarly, the idea of an individual's choice directly altering or limiting political power is seen as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. While societies might change power through collective action, this does not equate to individual choice at an individual level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

Despite these criticisms, it is acknowledged that political and moral freedoms exist in the modern Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. The Western world, for the past 250 years, has built a claim on freedom and seriously underlined it, making it attractive globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

## The Evolution of Western Freedom (Modern Age)

Modern Western freedom is seen as emerging from three distinct revolutions:

### 1. French Revolution (circa 1720s-1789)
This period marked the independence of individuals in Western society from the coercive dominance of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. After 200 years of devastating religious civil wars in Europe, it was understood that religious factions could not defeat each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Consequently, individuals gained the freedom to disregard religious obligations, with society even praising such independence as modern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. This revolution, unprecedented in history, led to significant advancements in science, knowledge, and political ideas by freeing thought from religious moral constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### 2. Post-World War I (1918)
The second revolution was driven by the massive migration from villages to gigantic cities like London, Paris, Berlin, New York, and Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This urbanization granted people the freedom of anonymity, allowing them to escape the responsibilities, restrictions, and moral concerns of a local identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. It led to radical changes in social customs, such as clothing (especially women's fashion), and the normalization of extramarital affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. This era also saw the rise of art movements, like Cubism and Surrealism, whose primary purpose was to shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### 3. The 1968 Revolution
This revolution was founded on the rapid increase in university populations, which diluted the traditional social responsibility of university life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. As a result, large segments of society embraced tremendous freedom in sexual morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. The development of birth control methods significantly reduced the risks associated with sexual intercourse, opening new horizons of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

These three steps – the pushing of religion into the background, the elimination of traditional local identity pressures, and the liberation of sexual life – contributed to Western societies gaining immense global attraction over 250 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. However, the sustainability of this "freedom climb" and whether it has produced universally good results for humanity is now a serious question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. The continuous stretching of societal frameworks that provide unity and common goals can lead to collapse and dispersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. There is a strong idea that the current point of freedom in the West is a "bankruptcy" or "collapse point" necessitating a re-establishment of certain structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

## Older Western Concepts of Freedom

The concept of freedom in the Western world existed before modernity, with roots in the Middle Ages (12th-13th centuries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This earlier understanding primarily concerned the relative freedom of powerful individuals or "race owners" (e.g., feudal lords) in relation to the King, based on mutual respect and boundary recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The concept of a "citizen" was not yet present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. Another key dimension was the independence of religious authority (the Church) from the state or ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

This fragmented European political structure meant that rulers attempting to centralize power and taxation faced fierce resistance for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. From the 16th century onwards, this fostered an abstract model where European countries saw themselves as civilized and free, contrasting with the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. European ruling classes were dynastic property owners whose power was not easily removed, unlike Ottoman ruling classes, who were civil servants whose fate and wealth were at the whim of the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

## Freedom in the Islamic World

Recent studies reveal that the pre-Ottoman [[impact_of_political_and_historical_contexts_on_middle_eastern_societies | Islamic world]], particularly during its "Bright Age" (e.g., Seljuks, principalities period), had structures not dissimilar to European feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. Power was fragmented among many layers and armed feudal lords, offering a relative freedom that was comparable to, and in some aspects superior to, Old Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. There was a theoretically and legally defined area of religious freedom that rulers could not violate, supported by a largely independent clergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

## Modern Democracy and its Criticisms

The contemporary use of the word "democracy" in propaganda discourse is often synonymous with supporting the USA or Western-liked allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. Regimes like Hungary, China, or Russia, despite having strong societal support and improving living conditions, are often not labeled as democracies but as "massacres" by this discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Conversely, countries where a "handful of degenerate oligarchs" govern, such as Ukraine, are presented as democracies because they are supported by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. This highlights a disconnect between the popular understanding of democracy and its political application in Western foreign policy.

### Modernization of Islamic Societies

The discussion touches on the modernization of Islamic societies, comparing figures like Ali Babacan (seen as moderate and trusted by Western financial circles) with more "strict regimes" such as Kemal or even Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. Prince Salman, despite being presented as "moderate" in some Western circles, is noted for extreme acts of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

A significant revolution is occurring in the Arab world, demonstrating a bold vision for modernity. Examples include ambitious architectural projects like a "new Kaaba" (a gigantic cube-shaped building) and "NEM" (a desert city designed like a space base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. This represents a claim to be the pioneers of modernity, asserting that the West is "finished" and cannot even manage basic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. These developments also include radical breaks from traditional patrons like England and America, forming alliances with Iran, accepting Syria back into the Arab League, and conducting trade in non-dollar currencies (e.g., Chinese Yuan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>. This marks a push for independence and leadership in a new global age, without abandoning the Islamic label and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. This suggests a redefinition of secularization, tailored to unique regional conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.

## Comparative Modernization: Russia vs. Ottoman Empire

A [[influence_of_historical_events_on_modern_politics | fundamental historical question]] is why leaders like Atatürk or Mahmud II could not achieve the same lasting reforms in Turkey as Peter the Great did in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire were similarly sized, faced similar ideological problems, and had comparable development levels at the beginning of the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. Russia made a significant leap in reforms, transforming into a major modern power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, despite attempts at reform, experienced a delay of about 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

The key difference lies in the leadership of modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. In Russia, the main engine of change and modernization was carried by the politically dominant Russian ethnic group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. New artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen were predominantly Russian or adopted a Russian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.

In the Ottoman Empire, however, the leadership of change and modernization was largely undertaken by non-Turkish, non-Muslim groups, specifically Christian elements like Greeks and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. These groups, while representing modernity and adopting Western-style practices, were distinct from the politically dominant Muslim Turkish population and often viewed as enemies of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>. This growing conflict eventually led to mutual massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>. This internal division, where the modernizing force was also considered an adversary, prevented the Ottoman Empire from achieving reforms comparable to Russia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

The demographic situation of Crimean Tatars is also touched upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>. Their population was historically spread across the northern Black Sea coast, including significant parts of modern Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, and the plains north of the Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. However, their political power was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>. Russia gradually absorbed these territories and cleared the Tatar population, leading to large-scale migrations, primarily to Dobruja (northern Bulgaria and eastern Romania) and then to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. The Crimean peninsula remained the longest region of significant Tatar political sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>. By the 20th century, the Tatar population in Crimea was greatly reduced, currently estimated at five to ten percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.

The concept of [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]] and its role in [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is a complex topic, influenced by historical events, ethnic diversity, and political ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. The term "Turk" itself has evolved, with its meaning being shaped by political and ideological definitions over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

## Defining "Turk"

The word "Turkish" refers to a specific segment of society with clearly defined boundaries for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. This identity is primarily shaped by politics, ideology, and, to some extent, language and shared traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. Elements that unite individuals under this identity include speaking the same language, belonging to the same state, having similar cultural traditions and memories, and often sharing the same religion and sect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

Historically, the administrative staff of the Turkish Republic has monopolized the concept of "Turk" and imposed it as an element of tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. This has led to the state "defiling" the term, turning it into a slogan of hostility and a war cry against its own citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

### Comparison with other National Identities

In contrast to countries like Germany, where the majority population is ethnically German and proud of their identity, the situation in [[historical_context_and_analysis_of_turkish_literature_and_culture | Turkey]] is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. For instance, Americans are simply called "Americans," not an "American ethnic group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

## Non-Turkish Identities within Turkey

### Kurds

A significant minority within [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Turkey]]'s population sees no reason to identify as Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] have existed for 2000 years with a distinct language, culture, and social memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. In their [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | social memory]], Turks have sometimes been allies but often enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. They refuse the "Turk" designation, similar to how Tatars or Chechens under Russian rule identify as Tatars or Chechens, not Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

> [!WARNING] State policies
> When the Turkish state attempts to humiliate them or ban their language and identity, it creates significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. A state built on hostility towards its own citizens is destined to face challenges and eventually lead to a "diluted fascist dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.

[[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] have their own distinct national identity, with different languages, social organization, habits, traditions, and even their own common cultural tales and epics, and different figures they consider heroes or villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. They have historically not been part of the "Turkish" collective for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. Their inability to exist under a separate common political identity is attributed to the "narrow-minded, bigoted, and stupid policies" of those governing the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The state's discourse of imposing Turkishness on everyone is "clearly not working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.

### Non-Muslim Communities

Historically, non-Muslims in [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Turkey]], such as Greeks (Rums) and Armenians, have never considered themselves Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>. Being called "Turk" was considered a "great insult," akin to "insulting his mother and father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. Despite this, they could and did coexist with Turks within the same state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. The significant Greek population, however, was "destroyed" after 1923, leaving no substantial groups to raise this identity question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>.

## Anatolian Geography and Turkic Settlement

"Anatolia" is defined as the peninsula known as Asia Minor, spanning west of the Euphrates from Adana to Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. The region east of the Euphrates, historically called Mesopotamia, Armenia, or part of Syria, is distinct from Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

During the Seljuk conquests around 1071, Alp Arslan conquered Anatolia, Syria, Iraq, and Armenia simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. At this time, regions east of the Euphrates had been under Muslim rule for centuries, though some areas had recently gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>. West of the Euphrates, Anatolia was a Christian country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.

Turkmen tribes settled across all these conquered areas, from Muğla to Diyarbakır, Mardin, Ardahan, Van, Tabriz, Mosul, Damascus, Aleppo, and Kirkuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. They established principalities in various locations, including Ahlat, Mardin, Hasankeyf, Mosul, Antakya, Konya, and Niksar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>.

Over the next 200-300 years, a notable difference emerged:
*   Turks did not assimilate in the east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
*   In the west of the Euphrates, Turks established "absolute dominance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>. Within 100-200 years of the conquest, regions like Muğla, Denizli, Aydın, Manisa, Kütahya, and Eskişehir became "completely Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. Meanwhile, in places like Mosul, Mardin, and Ahlat, where Turks had conquered much earlier, the Turks "melted away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>. This historical phenomenon of Turkic assimilation in some areas and dominance in others requires further historical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

## Armenian Communities and Migrations

The Armenian community in Sivrihisar, Eskişehir, was significant, with a history that parallels broader Armenian migrations in [[historical_context_and_analysis_of_turkish_literature_and_culture | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

Two major waves of Armenian migration occurred in [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Turkey]] to the west:
1.  **Early 17th Century:** Around 1602-1603, a massive migration wave occurred from Sivas to Eğin and Erzincan due to the Celali rebellions and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. The origin of Istanbul's Armenian community dates to this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. Most Armenians in the Marmara Region, including İzmit and Tekirdağ, migrated from Eastern Anatolia during the first decade of the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Mid-17th Century:** A second major wave of Armenian migration came from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. Communities in Bilecik, Geyve, and northern İzmit are noted to be of Iranian Armenian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. The Ottoman Empire actively encouraged these migrations, valuing Armenians for their commercial and trade skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

Beyond these major waves, there was a continuous migration of Armenians within Anatolia from areas like Kayseri to Konya, and Konya to Izmir, moving to towns and cities with commercial opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. Armenians often filled roles as shoemakers, tailors, jewelers, weavers, cotton and tobacco merchants, and coffee house owners where economic vitality was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. This indicates the significant [[cuisine_and_cultural_identity_in_istanbul | cultural and economic role]] played by Armenian communities in different regions.

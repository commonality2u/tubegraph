Becoming an effective tourist guide, especially when presenting culturally diverse regions, requires specific skills beyond mere factual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The approach should be tailored to the audience, focusing on their interests and understanding the historical context of a place's diverse heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Qualities of an Ideal Tourist Guide

An ideal tourist guide possesses a crucial ability to gauge the interests and needs of their group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This "sensitivity" is fundamental in distinguishing a good guide from a bad one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Tailoring Information Delivery

To engage an audience effectively:
*   **Target the "one inch above" rule**: Information conveyed should be slightly above the group's current level of knowledge and interest, not significantly higher or entirely familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid self-indulgence**: Do not discuss topics that solely concern the guide or are already known by the audience, as this can lead to disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain connection**: A guide must be alert to whether they are "increasing the gap" or "walking too far ahead" from their group. If so, they should step back and adjust to speak on the same wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Cultural Sensitivity and Historical Context

When guiding, especially in regions with diverse ethnic and national histories, cultural sensitivity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. For example, when visiting places like Diyarbakır's Eğil district, it's important to convey that the land has been home to many different nations, not solely one dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Understanding National Narratives

*   **Universal Similarities**: Across the world, national stories, emotional architectures, and mythologies are strikingly similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, such as those of the Kurdish, Estonian, or Scottish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Assumptions**: A guide must never assume that their personal emotional connection to a national story will have the same impact on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Broader Perspectives**: To genuinely interest an audience, a guide should rise above emotional biases and present narratives in a way that connects them to universal human experiences or broader historical patterns. For instance, connecting the Kurdish story to the Breton or Scottish narratives can offer a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### Historical Example: Eğil, Diyarbakır

Eğil, originally named Agl, is a Syriac (Aramaic) word, indicating its historical roots in Aramaic-speaking cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Its strategic location at a key pass in the Taurus Mountains, connecting Mesopotamia to the north (old Armen country), made it historically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

*   **Ancient Origins**: The city's founders from a few centuries before Christ spoke Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. A dynasty ruling in Pertek Castle conquered the region in the 1st century BC, establishing a local dominance in Eğil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Rule**: Later, Kurdish Mirs established a principality in Eğil, ruling independently until the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Nationalism and its Impact

The concept of "nation" and "nationalism" is a modern phenomenon, primarily emerging in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, notably after the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

### Pre-Nationalist State Forms

Before the modern nation-state, common state types included:
*   **City-States**: Characterized by strong solidarity within a city and its controlled provincial area, where citizens would sacrifice for the city's honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Dynastic States**: Loyalty was primarily to a sovereign dynasty, which was seen as the source of well-being and worthy of sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **Religious States**: Loyalty was often tied to religious identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Compulsory Military Service and the Nation-State

The mentality of a state based on nationality emerged in 1792 with the revolutionary regime in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Faced with a coalition of European states, France introduced compulsory military service for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, a radical innovation at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

*   **Shift from Professional Armies**: Previously, military service was a profession, either for career soldiers or ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   **"Our State is Ours"**: For ordinary citizens (farmers, bakers, shoemakers) to become soldiers, they needed to feel the state was "theirs" and that they were equal to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. This required the state to portray itself as representing the people, even if it was a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **The Three Legs**: The nation-state concept rests on three pillars: military service, the idea of the Republic, and the feeling of belonging to a nation that governs itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   **Spread of the Idea**: This new state theory, synonymous with the nation, spread rapidly across Europe from the early 1800s, influencing countries like Spain and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. Even the Ottoman Empire, facing Napoleon, considered establishing a similar army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### Impact on Multi-Ethnic Empires

The introduction of compulsory military service had an "inevitable result" in multi-ethnic societies: minority groups began to question their loyalty to a "dominant nation's" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. This led to calls for establishing their own states, a "typical disease of the 19th and 20th centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. This phenomenon contributed to the disintegration of empires like the Ottoman Empire, with Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Arabs, and Armenians seeking their own national states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>.

#### The Ottoman Experience

In the Ottoman Empire, compulsory military service was introduced from the 1820s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. Historically, military service was a professional and profitable occupation, offering income, spoils of war, and tax exemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>. However, under Islamic law, non-Muslims were generally forbidden from carrying weapons or commanding troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.

*   **Exemption Fees and Economic Shift**: When compulsory military service began, non-Muslims were exempt if they paid a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:24:00">[41:24:00]</a>. This led to the economic development of non-Muslim communities, as they had to engage in money-making ventures to afford the fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
*   **Decline of Muslim Peasants**: Conversely, Turkish and Balkan Muslim peasants, who were conscripted, suffered economically as they could not maintain their farms or businesses, preventing them from building sustainable fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.
*   **Tragic Outcomes**: This created resentment. Wealthy non-Muslims were then targeted, leading to the plundering of their properties. Figures like Vehbi Koç and Sakıp Sabancı's father amassed fortunes from the confiscated assets of Armenian and other non-Muslim communities in Ankara and Adana respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. This chain reaction of "stupid policies" led to a "human tragedy" and formed a basis for the Republican regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>.

## Modern Decline of Nationalism

In the 21st century, the sense of nationalism is "rapidly deteriorating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. Compulsory military service has largely disappeared in Western countries over the last 10-20 years, becoming a "professional" rather than a "breaking point" in a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. Professional armies, often composed of groups like Chechens or Africans, are hired, with loyalty based on economic benefit rather than national belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

This shift means the idea of sacrificing one's life for the homeland has become "an absurd idea" in Western societies, lacking credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. Consequently, the feeling of belonging to a nation with political ties has also diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.

### The Future of Power Structures

The speaker suggests that as the sense of nationalism declines, the future power dynamics may shift towards "strong core organizations based on force of arms," such as small, mutually loyal groups and their growing federations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. This trend is already violently evident in Latin American countries like Ecuador, Mexico, and El Salvador, where mafia organizations determine social life's main dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. This perspective, though perhaps pessimistic, suggests a move towards anarchy in an era of intense conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.

## Figures who Served "Turkishness"

The speaker posits that the person who served "Turkishness" the most in modern history was likely [[observations_on_travel_and_cultural_insights_about_albania | Egyptian Mehmet Ali Pasha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>, an Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.

*   **Albanian Influence**: In the 18th century, Albanians who converted to Islam and engaged in trade and business gained opportunities across the Balkans, spreading their influence and wealth from Greece to Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.
*   **Mehmet Ali Pasha's Rise**: From Kavala in northern Greece, Mehmet Ali Pasha, a member of an influential family, was sent to Egypt as an official, seized power, and established the new Egyptian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>.
*   **Turkish as Elite Language**: While his family likely spoke Albanian in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>, as a successful ruler in the Ottoman Empire, Turkish became his public, official, and "high language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. The ruling classes of the new Egyptian state spoke Turkish throughout the 19th century, with Turkish newspapers and poetry flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>. Turkish became the elite language of administration in Egypt until Gamal Abdel Nasser's regime in the 1950s, which established a more Arab-focused government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>. The speaker argues that this expansion of Turkish language influence through Mehmet Ali Pasha's rule was a significant "service to Turkishness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.

## Observations on Film and Human Nature

The speaker recommends two movies: "Society of the Snow" (Spanish-Chilean-Uruguayan production) and "Tchaikovsky's Wife" (Russian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>.

### "Society of the Snow"

This film depicts the harrowing true story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountains in the 1970s, where survivors resorted to cannibalism after 90 days of being stranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:44:00">[49:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a>. The speaker notes the survivors' initial failure to descend the mountain, as common survival wisdom dictates following streams to civilization, due to waiting for rescue and eventually weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:00">[51:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Movie

Three factors contribute to a truly good movie:
1.  **Storytelling Skill**: The capacity to tell a story and control its dynamics. Americans are exceptionally good at this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Human Sensitivity**: The ability to portray human emotions, motivations, and unexpected reactions with insight and understanding. Iranian movies excel in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>.
3.  **High Artistic Sensitivity**: A deep understanding of high literature and visual arts. This allows for richer expression and a broader perspective. Russian and Polish cinema often demonstrate this, sometimes seen in French cinema, but less so in American or Iranian cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:44:00">[55:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:13:00">[56:13:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Observations and Historical Parallels

### The Epstein Scandal

The speaker draws parallels between the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and intelligence agency operations, noting that intelligence agencies worldwide have long operated prostitution networks to compromise powerful figures. These networks collect information, photos, and videos for future leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51:00">[57:51:00]</a>.

*   Epstein and his partner Maxwell allegedly ran a network, primarily involving underage girls, on an island, entertaining leading figures from politics, business, and even royalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:00">[58:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>.
*   Epstein's suspicious death in jail, ruled a suicide but widely doubted, occurred as his trial was nearing an "exciting stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>.
*   Recent court documents have implicated high-profile individuals like Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Prince Andrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>.
*   The speaker suggests that beyond the sensationalism and moral accusations, the core issue is the revelation that Epstein and Maxwell were key agents of Israeli intelligence, as was Maxwell's father, Robert Maxwell, a former British press magnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43:00">[01:01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03:00">[01:02:03:00]</a>. The speaker questions the shift in the incident's focus and who is orchestrating these revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12:00">[01:03:12:00]</a>.

### Amazon Rainforest Discoveries

Recent archaeological findings in Ecuador have revealed traces of very ancient urban settlements in the Amazon rainforest, dating back over 2000 years (from 500 BC to 500 AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42:00">[01:03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00:00">[01:04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30:00">[01:08:30:00]</a>. These cities, built with mud and adobe due to the lack of stone, were quite large, with some suggesting populations of 10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50:00">[01:08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04:00">[01:09:04:00]</a>.

*   **Re-evaluating "Primitive" Societies**: This challenges the common perception that Amazonian indigenous groups, often seen as "primitive," represent an early stage of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04:00">[01:05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58:00">[01:07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Primitivism**: The speaker suggests that many such groups might be "secondary primitive," meaning they descended from more developed cultures that collapsed, and nature reclaimed their settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34:00">[01:04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34:00">[01:05:34:00]</a>. Their languages and social memories can hold surprising traces of more advanced traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14:00">[01:05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15:00">[01:08:15:00]</a>.

### The Question of World War III

Regarding the question of when World War III will be recognized, the speaker explains that unlike World War I, which rapidly escalated with clear declarations of war among major powers, World War II's start was initially more ambiguous for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15:00">[01:09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57:00">[01:09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34:00">[01:10:34:00]</a>.

*   Current conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen) are not yet World War III because major powers like America and Russia have not declared war on each other, framing their actions as "operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24:00">[01:11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33:00">[01:11:33:00]</a>. The true start will be when any or both of these countries begin open conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51:00">[01:11:51:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Leadership

The speaker asserts that the primary purpose of any leader throughout history is to "protect his own power and increase his own power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37:00">[01:12:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44:00">[01:12:44:00]</a>.

*   **Adaptability**: Leaders assess conditions and decide whether to offer concessions (bread, entertainment, victory) to please people or to instill fear, all in service of maintaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54:00">[01:12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25:00">[01:13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Art of Politics**: Leadership is an art with rules, and successful leaders play by these rules, often requiring luck and favorable circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50:00">[01:13:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56:00">[01:13:56:00]</a>.
*   **Unpredictability**: Political struggle involves numerous players in a "deadly struggle," making their actions unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32:00">[01:14:32:00]</a>. The most guaranteed, or "least stupid," way to predict political outcomes is through horoscopes, as demonstrated by the 16th-century political theorist Jean Bodin, whose work on the state dedicated a volume to astrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28:00">[01:15:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38:00">[01:15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16:00">[01:16:16:00]</a>.# Tourist Guide Skills and Cultural Sensitivity

Becoming an effective tourist guide, especially when presenting culturally diverse regions, requires specific skills beyond mere factual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The approach should be tailored to the audience, focusing on their interests and understanding the historical context of a place's diverse heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Qualities of an Ideal Tourist Guide

An ideal tourist guide possesses a crucial ability to gauge the interests and needs of their group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This "sensitivity" is fundamental in distinguishing a good guide from a bad one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Tailoring Information Delivery

To engage an audience effectively:
*   **Target the "one inch above" rule**: Information conveyed should be slightly above the group's current level of knowledge and interest, not significantly higher or entirely familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid self-indulgence**: Do not discuss topics that solely concern the guide or are already known by the audience, as this can lead to disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain connection**: A guide must be alert to whether they are "increasing the gap" or "walking too far ahead" from their group. If so, they should step back and adjust to speak on the same wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Cultural Sensitivity and Historical Context

When guiding, especially in regions with diverse ethnic and national histories, cultural sensitivity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. For example, when visiting places like Diyarbakır's Eğil district, it's important to convey that the land has been home to many different nations, not solely one dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Understanding National Narratives

*   **Universal Similarities**: Across the world, national stories, emotional architectures, and mythologies are strikingly similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, such as those of the Kurdish, Estonian, or Scottish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Assumptions**: A guide must never assume that their personal emotional connection to a national story will have the same impact on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Broader Perspectives**: To genuinely interest an audience, a guide should rise above emotional biases and present narratives in a way that connects them to universal human experiences or broader historical patterns. For instance, connecting the Kurdish story to the Breton or Scottish narratives can offer a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### Historical Example: Eğil, Diyarbakır

Eğil, originally named Agl, is a Syriac (Aramaic) word, indicating its historical roots in Aramaic-speaking cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Its strategic location at a key pass in the Taurus Mountains, connecting Mesopotamia to the north (old Armen country), made it historically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

*   **Ancient Origins**: The city's founders from a few centuries before Christ spoke Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. A dynasty ruling in Pertek Castle conquered the region in the 1st century BC, establishing a local dominance in Eğil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Rule**: Later, Kurdish Mirs established a principality in Eğil, ruling independently until the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Nationalism and its Impact

The concept of "nation" and "nationalism" is a modern phenomenon, primarily emerging in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, notably after the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

### Pre-Nationalist State Forms

Before the modern nation-state, common state types included:
*   **City-States**: Characterized by strong solidarity within a city and its controlled provincial area, where citizens would sacrifice for the city's honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Dynastic States**: Loyalty was primarily to a sovereign dynasty, which was seen as the source of well-being and worthy of sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **Religious States**: Loyalty was often tied to religious identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Compulsory Military Service and the Nation-State

The mentality of a state based on nationality emerged in 1792 with the revolutionary regime in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Faced with a coalition of European states, France introduced compulsory military service for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, a radical innovation at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

*   **Shift from Professional Armies**: Previously, military service was a profession, either for career soldiers or ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   **"Our State is Ours"**: For ordinary citizens (farmers, bakers, shoemakers) to become soldiers, they needed to feel the state was "theirs" and that they were equal to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. This required the state to portray itself as representing the people, even if it was a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **The Three Legs**: The nation-state concept rests on three pillars: military service, the idea of the Republic, and the feeling of belonging to a nation that governs itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   **Spread of the Idea**: This new state theory, synonymous with the nation, spread rapidly across Europe from the early 1800s, influencing countries like Spain and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. Even the Ottoman Empire, facing Napoleon, considered establishing a similar army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### Impact on Multi-Ethnic Empires

The introduction of compulsory military service had an "inevitable result" in multi-ethnic societies: minority groups began to question their loyalty to a "dominant nation's" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. This led to calls for establishing their own states, a "typical disease of the 19th and 20th centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. This phenomenon contributed to the disintegration of empires like the Ottoman Empire, with Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Arabs, and Armenians seeking their own national states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>.

#### The Ottoman Experience

In the Ottoman Empire, compulsory military service was introduced from the 1820s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. Historically, military service was a professional and profitable occupation, offering income, spoils of war, and tax exemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>. However, under Islamic law, non-Muslims were generally forbidden from carrying weapons or commanding troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.

*   **Exemption Fees and Economic Shift**: When compulsory military service began, non-Muslims were exempt if they paid a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:24:00">[41:24:00]</a>. This led to the economic development of non-Muslim communities, as they had to engage in money-making ventures to afford the fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
*   **Decline of Muslim Peasants**: Conversely, Turkish and Balkan Muslim peasants, who were conscripted, suffered economically as they could not maintain their farms or businesses, preventing them from building sustainable fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.
*   **Tragic Outcomes**: This created resentment. Wealthy non-Muslims were then targeted, leading to the plundering of their properties. Figures like Vehbi Koç and Sakıp Sabancı's father amassed fortunes from the confiscated assets of Armenian and other non-Muslim communities in Ankara and Adana respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. This chain reaction of "stupid policies" led to a "human tragedy" and formed a basis for the Republican regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>.

## Modern Decline of Nationalism

In the 21st century, the sense of nationalism is "rapidly deteriorating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. Compulsory military service has largely disappeared in Western countries over the last 10-20 years, becoming a "professional" rather than a "breaking point" in a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. Professional armies, often composed of groups like Chechens or Africans, are hired, with loyalty based on economic benefit rather than national belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

This shift means the idea of sacrificing one's life for the homeland has become "an absurd idea" in Western societies, lacking credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. Consequently, the feeling of belonging to a nation with political ties has also diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.

### The Future of Power Structures

The speaker suggests that as the sense of nationalism declines, the future power dynamics may shift towards "strong core organizations based on force of arms," such as small, mutually loyal groups and their growing federations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. This trend is already violently evident in Latin American countries like Ecuador, Mexico, and El Salvador, where mafia organizations determine social life's main dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. This perspective, though perhaps pessimistic, suggests a move towards anarchy in an era of intense conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.

## Figures who Served "Turkishness"

The speaker posits that the person who served "Turkishness" the most in modern history was likely [[observations_on_travel_and_cultural_insights_about_albania | Egyptian Mehmet Ali Pasha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>, an Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.

*   **Albanian Influence**: In the 18th century, Albanians who converted to Islam and engaged in trade and business gained opportunities across the Balkans, spreading their influence and wealth from Greece to Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.
*   **Mehmet Ali Pasha's Rise**: From Kavala in northern Greece, Mehmet Ali Pasha, a member of an influential family, was sent to Egypt as an official, seized power, and established the new Egyptian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>.
*   **Turkish as Elite Language**: While his family likely spoke Albanian in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>, as a successful ruler in the Ottoman Empire, Turkish became his public, official, and "high language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. The ruling classes of the new Egyptian state spoke Turkish throughout the 19th century, with Turkish newspapers and poetry flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>. Turkish became the elite language of administration in Egypt until Gamal Abdel Nasser's regime in the 1950s, which established a more Arab-focused government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>. The speaker argues that this expansion of Turkish language influence through Mehmet Ali Pasha's rule was a significant "service to Turkishness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.

## Observations on Film and Human Nature

The speaker recommends two movies: "Society of the Snow" (Spanish-Chilean-Uruguayan production) and "Tchaikovsky's Wife" (Russian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>.

### "Society of the Snow"

This film depicts the harrowing true story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountains in the 1970s, where survivors resorted to cannibalism after 90 days of being stranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:44:00">[49:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a>. The speaker notes the survivors' initial failure to descend the mountain, as common survival wisdom dictates following streams to civilization, due to waiting for rescue and eventually weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:00">[51:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Movie

Three factors contribute to a truly good movie:
1.  **Storytelling Skill**: The capacity to tell a story and control its dynamics. Americans are exceptionally good at this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Human Sensitivity**: The ability to portray human emotions, motivations, and unexpected reactions with insight and understanding. Iranian movies excel in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>.
3.  **High Artistic Sensitivity**: A deep understanding of high literature and visual arts. This allows for richer expression and a broader perspective. Russian and Polish cinema often demonstrate this, sometimes seen in French cinema, but less so in American or Iranian cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:44:00">[55:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:13:00">[56:13:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Observations and Historical Parallels

### The Epstein Scandal

The speaker draws parallels between the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and intelligence agency operations, noting that intelligence agencies worldwide have long operated prostitution networks to compromise powerful figures. These networks collect information, photos, and videos for future leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51:00">[57:51:00]</a>.

*   Epstein and his partner Maxwell allegedly ran a network, primarily involving underage girls, on an island, entertaining leading figures from politics, business, and even royalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:00">[58:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>.
*   Epstein's suspicious death in jail, ruled a suicide but widely doubted, occurred as his trial was nearing an "exciting stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>.
*   Recent court documents have implicated high-profile individuals like Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Prince Andrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>.
*   The speaker suggests that beyond the sensationalism and moral accusations, the core issue is the revelation that Epstein and Maxwell were key agents of Israeli intelligence, as was Maxwell's father, Robert Maxwell, a former British press magnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43:00">[01:01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03:00">[01:02:03:00]</a>. The speaker questions the shift in the incident's focus and who is orchestrating these revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12:00">[01:03:12:00]</a>.

### Amazon Rainforest Discoveries

Recent archaeological findings in Ecuador have revealed traces of very ancient urban settlements in the Amazon rainforest, dating back over 2000 years (from 500 BC to 500 AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42:00">[01:03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00:00">[01:04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30:00">[01:08:30:00]</a>. These cities, built with mud and adobe due to the lack of stone, were quite large, with some suggesting populations of 10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50:00">[01:08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04:00">[01:09:04:00]</a>.

*   **Re-evaluating "Primitive" Societies**: This challenges the common perception that Amazonian indigenous groups, often seen as "primitive," represent an early stage of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04:00">[01:05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58:00">[01:07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Primitivism**: The speaker suggests that many such groups might be "secondary primitive," meaning they descended from more developed cultures that collapsed, and nature reclaimed their settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34:00">[01:04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34:00">[01:05:34:00]</a>. Their languages and social memories can hold surprising traces of more advanced traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14:00">[01:05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15:00">[01:08:15:00]</a>.

### The Question of World War III

Regarding the question of when World War III will be recognized, the speaker explains that unlike World War I, which rapidly escalated with clear declarations of war among major powers, World War II's start was initially more ambiguous for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15:00">[01:09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57:00">[01:09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34:00">[01:10:34:00]</a>.

*   Current conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen) are not yet World War III because major powers like America and Russia have not declared war on each other, framing their actions as "operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24:00">[01:11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33:00">[01:11:33:00]</a>. The true start will be when any or both of these countries begin open conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51:00">[01:11:51:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Leadership

The speaker asserts that the primary purpose of any leader throughout history is to "protect his own power and increase his own power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37:00">[01:12:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44:00">[01:12:44:00]</a>.

*   **Adaptability**: Leaders assess conditions and decide whether to offer concessions (bread, entertainment, victory) to please people or to instill fear, all in service of maintaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54:00">[01:12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25:00">[01:13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Art of Politics**: Leadership is an art with rules, and successful leaders play by these rules, often requiring luck and favorable circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50:00">[01:13:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56:00">[01:13:56:00]</a>.
*   **Unpredictability**: Political struggle involves numerous players in a "deadly struggle," making their actions unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32:00">[01:14:32:00]</a>. The most guaranteed, or "least stupid," way to predict political outcomes is through horoscopes, as demonstrated by the 16th-century political theorist Jean Bodin, whose work on the state dedicated a volume to astrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28:00">[01:15:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38:00">[01:15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16:00">[01:16:16:00]</a>.

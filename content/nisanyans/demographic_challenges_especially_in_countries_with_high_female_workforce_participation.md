Demographic regression, particularly in countries with high female workforce participation, is a significant global issue, with an "incredible demographic collapse everywhere except Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>. This phenomenon is characterized by a radical decline in birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>.

## Global Fertility Decline

The fertility rate, which needs to be at least 2.1 to sustain the human population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, has plummeted in many regions:
*   **South Korea** has seen its fertility rate drop to 0.68 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>, implying that two-thirds of its population could be eliminated within a generation, falling from 60 million to 20 million in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   In **Western Europe**, the fertility rate per woman is approximately 1.1-1.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>, while in the **United States**, it is slightly higher but still "well below two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
*   In [[challenges_of_modernization_in_turkey | TÃ¼rkiye]], the fertility rate has also significantly fallen among Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.
*   Conversely, while Africa's fertility rate is decreasing, it remains at the "replacement rin" (replacement rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>, and populations continue to increase in South America and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. This trend has led to the discussion of a "possibility of the extinction of the white race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Fertility Decline

Several factors contribute to this demographic shift:

### Impact of Female Workforce Participation
[[impact_of_societal_roles_on_womens_achievements | Encouraging women to pursue careers]] outside the home, family, and village "radically suppresses the fertility rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

### Delayed Marriage and Changing Marital Norms
The increasing age at which people marry "seriously affects the fertility rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. This delay, coupled with the "spread and normalization of extramarital affairs," leads to the "disappearance of the meaning of marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. In such conditions, people are "hesitant and afraid" to have children due to the perceived instability of marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

### Economic Factors: Housing Costs
A significant deterrent to having children is the astronomical rise in house prices, which has made the opportunity for young people to own a home "almost fallen to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. This economic barrier makes it difficult for young adults to envision starting a family without a stable living situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

In contrast, in some regions, like parts of Africa, houses can be built in two days with community effort, making housing a non-issue for starting a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. Notably, countries like Russia and former Soviet states have the highest rates of private home ownership, with many not paying rent or mortgage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. This contrasts sharply with most Western countries, where house ownership for the younger generation is "beyond imagination" without significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. This situation is deemed a "great administrative disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>.

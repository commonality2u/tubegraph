From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker offers several reflections on personal identity, societal roles, and the broader context of national and cultural identities, drawing parallels between different societies and historical periods. These insights are shared amidst a personal account of a challenging trip to Morocco and Spain.

## A Stolen Journey and Its Unforeseen Reflections
The speaker recounts a three-week trip to Morocco, initially an organized tour with 38 friends, followed by personal exploration of the country, extending to Spain. The journey took an unexpected turn when passports and money were stolen in Granada, Spain, leaving the speaker and companion stranded. This incident necessitated obtaining travel papers from consulates, which restricted travel to their respective home countries: Greece for the companion and Armenia for the speaker [00:02:29]. This predicament forced the speaker to reflect while waiting for a midnight flight in Vienna [00:03:32].

## Modernity and National Identity: Morocco vs. Turkey
A significant portion of the reflection centers on a discussion about modernity in Morocco compared to Turkey, sparked by conversations during the trip [00:04:46].

*   **Defining Modernity**: The speaker notes that the "modern parts of the cities" in Morocco are extremely clean, orderly, and contemporary, similar to Europe, with all the conveniences and commercial services of modern life [00:05:17]. Rabat, in particular, was striking for its greenery and organization [00:05:51].
*   **Preservation of Old Cities**: Unlike Turkey, Morocco has preserved its ancient cities and neighborhoods in their original detail, without modern structures disrupting the historical fabric. These old cities, like the Medina in Marrakesh, are remarkably large and intact [00:06:16].
*   **Traditional Lifestyles**: In rural southern Morocco, lifestyles from centuries ago continue to exist, indicating that one end of the social spectrum is less integrated into the 21st century than in Turkey [00:07:00].
*   **Colonial Influence**: The 40-50 years of French rule in Morocco have left a considerable effect, with French being widely spoken and used in official settings, even more so than Arabic in some places [00:07:36]. This represents a "European polish" while many traditional social dimensions are still preserved [00:08:00].

### Expressions of Loyalty and Identity
The speaker observes strong national identity in Morocco, particularly evident in the pervasive slogans praising the King and the display of his photographs in public and private establishments [00:08:27].

*   **"Allah el Vatan El Malik"**: This slogan, meaning "God, the Homeland, and the King," is seen as the equivalent of "I am a Turk" in Turkey, reflecting deep loyalty to the monarch [00:08:39].
*   **Generational Differences**: While older and more conservative Moroccans express unwavering loyalty to the King, younger, modern, secular-leaning individuals, particularly women, show a "fanatic" adherence to the King, which the speaker astonishingly equates to fanatical Kemalism in Turkey [00:09:15].
*   **Political Equivalence**: The speaker finds an "astonishing social equivalence" between radical King Mohammed VI loyalism and radical Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrkism [01:0:11, 00:10:26]. This suggests that the idolization of a leader can serve similar social functions, regardless of the political system. The speaker ponders whether the *form* of government (Republic vs. Kingdom) chosen by Kemal Pasha might have altered the nature of Turkish identity and ideology [01:1:41].

### The Future of Traditional Crafts
The speaker also notes that while Morocco's Fez Bazaar showcases vibrant craftsmanship reminiscent of the Middle Ages, with active manufacturing tradesmen [00:17:00], the average age of these craftsmen is over 50 [00:18:17]. This leads to the observation that this "real handicraft tradition" will likely be "dead or very weak 20-30 years from now" [00:18:52].

## Societal Structure and Class Identity

### The Republic's Middle Class Project
The speaker addresses a question about the Republic of Turkey's impact on equality of opportunity compared to the Ottoman Empire. The Republic's "great effort and success" was to create a middle class [00:28:43].

*   **Characteristics of the Middle Class**: This class consisted of "sufficiently literate urbanite" individuals qualified to be civil servants or professionals like lawyers, doctors, and accountants [00:28:55]. This creation of a middle class is described as the essence of "modernization" that began in the 19th century [00:29:31].
*   **Contrast with Ottoman Society**: Prior to the Republic, Ottoman society was primarily composed of peasants, tradesmen, warrior/state administrators, and clergy [00:29:59]. While the 19th-century Ottoman modernization created a non-Muslim middle class (Greeks, Armenians, Levantines, Assyrians) [00:30:58, 00:36:54], this was largely destroyed in the early 20th-century crises [00:31:18, 00:37:07].
*   **A New Turkish-Muslim Middle Class**: The Republic aimed to replace this lost class by creating a new middle class of Turkish Muslim peasants and townspeople, a project in which it was largely successful [00:31:49, 00:35:43]. This new middle class became the primary advocate for Republican reforms and Kemalist ideology [00:32:33].

### The Republic's Failure to Cultivate an Elite
Despite the success in creating a middle class, the speaker argues that the Republic made an "unforgivable mistake" by failing to foster a ruling elite [00:33:06].

*   **Suppression of Intellectuals**: The Republic "never faced the fact that a society needed not only a middle class but also a ruling elite" [00:33:22]. It turned against and saw elite education institutions as enemies, suppressing individuals who thought "outside the limits" and were responsible for managing and changing the regime's boundaries [00:33:35].
*   **Consequences**: This suppression led to a society with a large middle class and an even larger proletariat, but "with no heads, with cut heads" [00:34:43]. The speaker believes this has resulted in a "miserable, poor, untalented, uneducated, ignorant society" that is "much further behind the rest of the world than it was 100 years ago" [00:35:32].

## Individual Identity and Purpose

### Accepting One's Nature
In response to a question about changing one's "sheep nature" to a "wolf nature," the speaker suggests that if one's nature is indeed like a sheep, it should be accepted, as "nature is the name of what is unchangeable in humans" [00:27:06]. The speaker advises making peace with it [00:28:04].

### The Dream of Permanence and Legacy
The speaker delves into the meaning of being remembered after death. While acknowledging that "nothing you do in life actually has any meaning" in the face of death [00:38:24], the most crucial drive connecting humans to life is the "dream of permanence" [00:38:40].

*   **Leaving a Legacy**: The "feeling of leaving a work for the society you live in, the community you belong to, the family you belong to, your lineage, your children and your descendants," though irrational, is a fundamental human drive [00:39:21].
*   **Sense of Lineage**: The speaker stresses the importance of a "sense of lineage," desiring to leave something for one's children and grandchildren to carry on one's name with pride [00:39:49].
*   **Critique of Childlessness**: The speaker expresses doubt about the "moral fortitude" of those who do not want children, viewing them as "naughty people" [00:40:54].
*   **Consistency and Morality**: This belief in leaving a legacy (not just monetary, but also fame) is essential for consistency and morality. Without it, one becomes a "Rogue bear," living solely for consumption, which is "miserable," "meaningless," and leads to depression [00:41:18].

### Conditions for Sustaining a Legacy
Reflecting on the short-lived legacy of a wealthy Chilean artist's palace in Morocco, the speaker identifies two conditions for sustaining a grand creation and passing it through generations [02:20:00].

*   **Sustainable Income**: A long-term, solid source of income, which the speaker argues, in the modern world, is primarily agricultural (land ownership), as other sources like bank accounts or stock market investments are too volatile [02:49:00].
*   **Many Children**: One must have many children, increasing the probability that at least one will be capable and willing to continue the work [02:06:09]. Without these conditions, creating "great beauty in today's world" with lasting impact is impossible [02:26:00].

## Gender Roles and Violence
The speaker presents controversial views on violence between genders.

*   **Critique of "Male Violence" Focus**: The speaker states a disbelief that "male violence against women is a big problem" or the "main problem," nor that it is right to constantly highlight it [00:59:53].
*   **"Female Violence" as More Serious**: Instead, the speaker believes that "female violence against men is a much more serious, much more deadly problem" [01:00:19].
*   **Forms of Violence**: Women, rarely using physical violence, are said to apply "psychological violence" to darken men's lives "insidiously," especially after fulfilling their reproductive function [01:00:39, 01:01:11, 01:01:46]. The speaker uses the analogy of the praying mantis female eating the male after mating [01:01:57].
*   **Men's "Simple" Nature**: Men are described as "simple creatures" with "primitive" needs, who are made happy by covering life's difficulties with love and pleasing their loved ones [01:02:11, 01:02:43].
*   **Male Violence as Desperation**: A "very large part" of male violence against women, including murders, is seen as a "cry of desperation," a "madness incident" when a man is "defeated in the psychological war" and his "life's light has darkened" [01:03:50, 01:04:01].
*   **Impact of Restraining Orders**: The speaker links the "astronomical" increase in injuries and murders against women since 2006 (when restraining orders became unilaterally issued in Turkey based on a woman's statement) to this legal change. Being removed from one's home is described as the "most despicable act of humiliation that can be directed at a man," destroying his "most basic instincts" and making his life "unlivable" [01:05:00, 01:06:19]. The speaker notes that despite clear observations, no sociology department has researched this link [01:06:39].

## Cultural and Religious Identity: The Chaldeans
A question about the Chaldeans prompts a detailed explanation of distinct Christian Syriac groups, highlighting their historical and theological divisions and cultural markers.

*   **Syriac Identity**: The term "Syriac" typically refers to the Syriac Ancient (Jacobite) sect, strong in Mardin, Aleppo, and Urfa [00:43:26].
*   **Nestorians**: A separate group speaking and worshipping in Syriac, they split from the main Christian world in 431 AD and settled in the Iranian world, primarily east of the Tigris (Mosul, Baghdad, Siirt) [00:43:54, 00:44:05].
*   **Catholic Influence (Unat)**: Under European influence, some Syriacs and Nestorians recognized the Pope's superiority (forming "Unat" or united sects) to protect themselves from Turks and Muslims [00:45:09, 00:45:39].
*   **Chaldeans**: In Turkish and Ottoman terminology, Nestorians who remained loyal to the Pope were called Chaldeans [00:46:15].
*   **Syriac Catholics**: A separate sect from both Syriac (Jacobite) and Nestorian Catholicism [00:46:46].
*   **Language and Worship**: Nestorians in Turkey generally speak Kurdish as their mother tongue and use an old Syriac dialect for worship. Chaldeans often know Arabic as their common language, also using an old Syriac version for worship, and mention the Pope in their services [00:47:43].

## Leadership and Power: The "Mafia Boss" Metaphor
In discussing personality traits required for a "father" (implicitly, a leader or powerful figure), the speaker draws parallels to a "mafia boss."

*   **Core Traits**: The essential conditions for being a mafia boss are "loyalty" and "reliability" [00:51:32]. A leader must keep their word and protect friends to the end [00:51:37].
*   **Building Loyalty**: To be strong, a leader must create "unconditionally loyal" followers, which is achieved by being "unconditionally loyal to them" [00:52:35].
*   **Brutality as an Extension**: The ability to commit brutality is a "derivative" of reliability, as it ensures that betrayers are destroyed, thereby solidifying loyalty among others [00:52:47]. Reliability involves both rewarding the loyal and punishing the disloyal [00:53:07].

### Other Thoughts
The speaker briefly touches upon other topics including the Ukraine War and its geopolitical motivations [01:07:42], and a lighthearted hypothetical scenario of quarantining public figures [01:12:57].

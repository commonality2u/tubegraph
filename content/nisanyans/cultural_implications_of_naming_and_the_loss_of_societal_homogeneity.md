The freedom to name children as parents wish has significant cultural implications, often leading to a loss of societal homogeneity and the emergence of class distinctions tied to naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.

## Historical Naming Practices

Historically, many Christian countries, including France and Greece, had restrictions on naming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. Until the early 1990s in France, it was forbidden to use names not found in the Catholic religious calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>. Greece still maintains a similar system, where names are typically chosen from a list of over a thousand saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>.

This system, where names are associated with specific feast days, makes it easy to remember annual celebrations (name days instead of birthdays) and links individuals to legendary, symbolic, and protective mythological personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Impact of Naming Freedom

When naming freedom is introduced, as seen in France since the early 2000s, an unexpected outcome is the prevalence of "freak" or "absurd" names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. More significantly, these unique names begin to carry a distinct class stamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>, allowing one to infer the social class of the child's parents and their adherence to certain fashion trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

### Loss of Homogeneity

A fixed and universal repertoire of names, akin to the role of religion, serves to make society more homogeneous or egalitarian, even if only symbolically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. For example, if both the wealthiest and poorest individuals share common names like Ã–mer and Mustafa, it fosters a sense of commonality within the society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. This shared naming tradition reinforces a belief in common sacred mythologies, value judgments, and personality stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>.

Conversely, allowing complete freedom in naming leads to certain groups and classes forming their own distinct naming patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>. This phenomenon ultimately results in the destruction of cultural homogeneity and the theoretical sense of equality that bind a society together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

### Situation in Turkey

A similar change has occurred in Turkey, possibly around 2006 or 2008, where a law was altered to allow parents to give their children any name they desire, including foreign language names written with Turkish letters (excluding characters like X, W, V, Q, or mathematical symbols and numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. This radical break from customs and traditions can lead to generations becoming alienated from the continuities that define their society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

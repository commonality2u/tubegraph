This article explores several significant historical events and ongoing societal dynamics related to Turkey, drawing insights from a recent discussion.

## The Armenian Genocide: A Historical Perspective

April 24 is globally recognized as the Armenian Genocide commemoration day, particularly in Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The events of April 24, 1915, marked a political step immediately preceding the genocide itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. On that night, prominent Armenian intellectuals, writers, politicians, doctors, lawyers, and clergymen—totaling 235 to 250 individuals—were arrested in Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They were sent to locations like Ayaş and Çankırı, and most were subsequently killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This act is described as a "political collapse operation" akin to those seen in the [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | history of the Republic of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Similar operations were noted in 2016 and on September 12, where the state profiled and collected information, then suddenly rounded up individuals regardless of guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

After these initial arrests, mass deportations of Armenian civilians, including children, began nationwide in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This rapidly escalated into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### The Denial Policy

The speaker firmly states that denying the Armenian Genocide is either "complete ignorance" or "immoral," often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He emphasizes that it is a widely known fact globally, except in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

The Turkish State's policy regarding the genocide until 1975 was largely one of silence, not deeming it necessary to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This policy was maintained through the Atatürk, İnönü, and Menderes periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The topic re-emerged on the global agenda in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union and Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. However, Turkey continued its silence policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

The situation drastically changed around 1974-1975, following Turkey's [[historical_intersection_of_turkey_and_european_politics | Cyprus operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Turkey's international reputation declined, and a strong anti-Turkish sentiment began to grow in Western countries like America, France, and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This period saw the emergence of the ASALA organization, which started organizing attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Simultaneously, the Western press suddenly highlighted the Armenian Genocide as a major 20th-century crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Turkey responded with a "stupid" denial policy, believing it could weather the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Turkey's policy of denial, largely shaped by figures like Cem Coşkun Kırca and Aktar, has continued for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Attempts at Confrontation

Between 2005 and 2011-2012, a "window of hope" emerged, suggesting Turkey might abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. During this time, the genocide was openly discussed in mainstream Turkish media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, with some advocating for Turkey to acknowledge the "terrible thing" that happened to millions of Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. However, official courage to take this step was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The speaker believes that confronting this issue would be beneficial for Turkey, alleviating a "heavy burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

The genocide is described as the most significant social and political event in Turkey's century-long period, profoundly altering its societal composition, political structures, and economic basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This process of cleansing Anatolia's non-Muslim population also targeted Greeks and Assyrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. The idea for this cleansing had been debated since the 1890s, during the era of Sultan Abdulhamid II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. While the Union and Progress regime initially had an optimistic approach after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, they eventually returned to the "Abdulhamid project" of ethnic cleansing by 1909-1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. This was further solidified after the Balkan Wars and the subsequent re-establishment of Union and Progress power in 1913, leading to the deliberate implementation of the project in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

Unlike the Greek population exchange, where a mutual transfer facilitated settlement, Armenians had no designated place to go, leading to the decision for massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This was seen as a strategic move to prevent future demands for compensation or land should the Ottoman Empire lose World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## Modern Turkish Politics and Society

### Post-1974 International Standing

After 1974, Turkey's international standing suffered significantly, particularly in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | Cyprus incident]] was a major turning point, permanently straining Turkey's relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### The Şirince Case and Cultural Divide

The discussion touches upon the legal and societal challenges faced in Turkey, exemplified by the Şirince case involving Nişanyan. Despite an initiative in Şirince that benefited the village economically and had no opposing interests, it faced obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>. The primary hurdles were the surname "Nişanyan" and the broader cultural divide in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. The speaker argues that many well-educated, urban, and Turkish-speaking individuals, who have dominated state levels since 1980, view others with suspicion and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. This religious and class-based division makes straightforward solutions unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## Historical Ottoman and Byzantine Dynamics

### Ottoman Empire's Centers of Gravity

The Ottoman Empire had multiple centers of gravity, including Rumelia, Anatolia, and significantly, Egypt, which served as a "wheat barn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. Rumelia was a fertile agricultural land, contributing a major portion of state income, while Anatolia was crucial for military recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. The Ottoman Empire maintained a consistent balance between these three regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>.

### Byzantine Empire's Shifting Balance

The Byzantine Empire's borders and centers of gravity shifted significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>. While the strait and Istanbul were central, periods saw the Balkan Peninsula fall out of Byzantium's direct control, forcing a focus on Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. During the 700s, 800s, and 900s, Anatolia was the center of gravity, under pressure from both Western and Arab forces, eventually leading to Byzantium's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>.

### Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Cosmopolitanism

Fatih Sultan Mehmet's era, preceded by the Second Murat Period, was a time of significant cultural fusion and transformation across the Mediterranean, including Italy and the Edirne Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This was an astonishingly cosmopolitan world, where Greeks, Italians, architects, and artists interacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:13">[01:42:13]</a>. Fatih Sultan Mehmet, like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was a product of the Ottoman Empire's late-period cosmopolitan culture, which was more relaxed and multicultural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>.

## Global and Regional International Relations

### Interference in Other Countries' Affairs

The speaker rejects a categorical "right or wrong" stance on a country's interference in another's internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. He argues that neighboring countries sometimes *must* interfere if their neighbors' actions (domestic or foreign policy mistakes) threaten their own stability or citizens' well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. However, this interference must have "limits to decency" and "measure," avoiding intrusive actions like entering a neighbor's bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

### The USA as a Global Empire

The USA, particularly after 1945, developed a unique model of global sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. While maintaining itself as a nation-state within its borders, it exercises imperial control globally without direct administrative takeover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. The USA funnels money through various methods, dictates military decisions, and influences the foreign policies of many nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>. Many heads of state effectively act as "provincial governors," obliged to carry out US directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>. This "rough global empire" differs from older empires by having minimal obligations to its subjects, offering "honey and cream" without the responsibilities of citizenship rights, hospitals, or social welfare found in traditional empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

### Pakistan and US Foreign Policy

The recent political developments in Pakistan, particularly the overthrow of Imran Khan, are seen as a significant miscalculation by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Khan openly challenged US foreign policy regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, refusing to condemn Russia and continuing economic ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. More importantly, this period saw Pakistan and India align on a significant foreign policy issue for the first time since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. This alignment, challenging the US policy of maintaining conflict between the two, is seen as the reason for Khan's ouster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

### Turkish-Greek Relations and the "Blue Homeland"

The Greek military is reportedly anticipating a serious war with Turkey in the near future, driven by a strong sense of nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:29">[01:44:29]</a>. The "Blue Homeland" (Mavi Vatan) doctrine relates to the discovery of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>. Initial plans to transport gas to Europe via Turkey were thwarted, leading Israel, Egypt, and Greece to attempt to exclude Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>. In response, Turkey asserted its claim over these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.

## Other Historical Notes

### Izmir Fire (1922)

The 1922 Izmir fire was not met with silence in the West, but rather with widespread public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. However, in the context of the World War I and subsequent conflicts, the destruction of a city was not an unprecedented event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. The prevailing assumption at the time was the creation of homogeneous nation-states through ethnic cleansing, implying that Greeks would leave Turkey and Turks would leave Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>. The argument for Izmir to remain Greek as a refuge for expelled Greeks was logical to many, but it was understood that Izmir's port was vital to the Aegean region's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. Thus, the strategy was to use the Greeks in Turkey as leverage to compel the Ankara government to agree to terms favorable to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:45">[01:39:45]</a>.

### Lezgins in Shirvan Wars

The Lezgin people were significantly impacted by the conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and Russia, particularly in the Shirvan region in the 18th and early 19th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. The Lezgins were divided, with half remaining in Dagestan and the other half on the Azerbaijani side, facing oppression and assimilationist policies from the Turkish-speaking Azeris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>.

### CHP's "Middle-Left" Opening (1960s)

The "left opening" of the Republican People's Party (CHP) in the mid-1960s (around 1964-1965) was a significant development in [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | Turkish political developments and changes in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. This shift, influenced by figures like İsmet İnönü and Bülent Ecevit, was partly a response to the rise of the Turkish Workers' Party (TİP) in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. TİP's surprising electoral success created a "great panic" within the political system, forcing the CHP to adopt a more leftist stance to survive against the large right-wing bloc and a potential Labor Party threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. This move was also seen as aligning with American interests to maintain order in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

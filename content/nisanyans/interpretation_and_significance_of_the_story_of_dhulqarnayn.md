The speaker intends to present analyses of the Quranic text from a non-Islamic perspective, going "beyond the framework of the Islamic perspective" to understand the Quran more clearly and powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Among the four main topics to be discussed, one is the story of Dhul-Qarnayn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The speaker's intention is to "prove that the story of Dhul-Qar cannot be a work of revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

However, a detailed analysis or interpretation of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn is not provided in this transcript. The speaker states that he will "go into the story of Dhul-Qarnayn" at a later point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>, after discussing other topics such as the story of the Seven Sleepers, the meaning of "Rakim," and the word "Hurin."

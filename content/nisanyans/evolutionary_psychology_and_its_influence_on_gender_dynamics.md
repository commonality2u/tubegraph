Evolutionary psychology offers a perspective on observed [[Biological differences between men and women | gender differences]] by attributing them to [[Biological differences between men and women | biological functions]] and evolutionary adaptations, rather than solely to [[male_dominance_and_its_impact_on_womens_opportunities | societal oppression]] or lack of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This view suggests that fundamental [[Biological differences between men and women | biological disparities]] between sexes lead to distinct psychological profiles and roles that have been consistent across various [[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | cultures]] and historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Historical Absence of Women in Certain Fields

Historically, there has been a notable absence of women achieving prominence in certain fields, such as arts, visual arts, and music, across diverse [[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | cultures]] including ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean societies, American natives, and Islamic cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The argument extends to a general observation that, "as a rule it does not come out when opportunities are given" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. While there are a few good writers among women, their numbers are not very many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Similarly, in politics, few women have emerged as prominent figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This pattern, it is argued, is not primarily due to [[male_dominance_and_its_impact_on_womens_opportunities | oppression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Biological Basis of Gender Dynamics

The core of this perspective lies in the understanding of [[Biological differences between men and women | human psychology]] and [[Biological differences between men and women | biological differences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[Biological differences between men and women | Women and men]] are understood to have different biological functions, stemming from distinct genetic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These differences lead to "different home psychological advantages and disadvantages for women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Roles of Women

A woman's fundamental biological function is understood to be related to childbirth and child-rearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This includes giving birth, ensuring the child's safety, looking after the child, and feeding the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. These are considered primary duties, derived from biological functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Roles of Men

Conversely, men have biologically tried to compensate for their "biological dysfunctions" and "weaknesses" in the biological field by developing skills and ambitions in other areas, such as arts, science, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This suggests that men's drive for achievement in these fields is a compensatory mechanism for their lesser direct involvement in reproductive biological processes.

## Evolutionary Parallels in Mammals

This view often draws parallels to the animal kingdom, particularly mammals and primates. The speaker notes that humans are not very different from monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The functions of men and women in mammals are described as "very obvious and very logical," characterized by "differences in procedures that are obligatory due to the biological evolution brought by the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

> "When you look at monkeys, when you look at the function of men and the function of women in mammals, it is very obvious and very logical, that is, there are differences in procedures that are obligatory due to the biological evolution brought by the universe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

This perspective emphasizes that despite the "complex, unnatural qualities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> of modern society, the underlying nature of humans as animals remains primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Societal achievements in science, art, and politics are seen as "decorations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> built upon this fundamental biological reality.

## Modern Society and Equality

While acknowledging that women should be given certain rights and that equality is a form of settlement that "cannot be discussed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, the speaker asserts that the underlying truth is that "the human being is an animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The primary function of a human being in this context is considered to be sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Within these functions, "what women and men can do are different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This perspective posits that objective truths, even if unpopular in an age that prioritizes "ideological lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, remain facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

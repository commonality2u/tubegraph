## Origins of Place Names: Malazgirt

The town of Malazgirt was known as Manaz Gert before the arrival of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. This name has been recorded for five centuries in historical documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. The suffix "kert," which appears as "gerd" in Western Armenian, means "city" in Eastern Armenian and Old Persian (pre-Islamic Persian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. For example, the city of Carthage (`Kartaca`) in Tunisia shares the same root word for "city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. Thus, Manaz Gert means "Manaz city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

According to a 6th-century historian, the original name was "Manav Gerir" because it was founded by a person named Manav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This was long believed to be a legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, archaeological discoveries of the Urartian kingdom revealed cuneiform tablets mentioning a great king named Menua (pronounced `Menas` in Armenian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This led to the understanding that the city of Manaz Gert was founded by the Urartian King Menu or an ancestor with the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

## The Term "Byzantine Empire"

The term "Byzantine Empire" to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire was a construct invented by European intellectuals and Renaissance historians in the mid-16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. The empire itself never referred to itself as "Byzantine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. "Byzantium" was originally the name of the city of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. A recently discovered medallion from around 1478-1480, made by an Italian artist, portrays Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror with the inscription "Byzantine Imperator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. This inscription, however, implies "Emperor of Istanbul" rather than the name of an empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. The academic use of "Byzantine Empire" was popularized by Hieronymus Wolf in 1556 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. It is a fact that Eastern Roman emperors in Istanbul, Iznik, and Trabzon never called themselves "Byzantine Emperor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. This historical perspective is part of [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | historical perspectives and cultural heritage of Turkey]].

## The "Greengrocers" (`Manavlar`) in Anatolia

The term "greengrocer" (`Manav`), used to refer to a specific group of people, is geographically limited to the borders of the former Ottoman province of Hüdavendigar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. This province includes Bursa (center), Balıkesir, the southern part of Çanakkale, Bilecik, İzmit, and Adapazarı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. The term refers to the local agricultural Muslim population of this region who were not Yoruks (nomadic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. The modern Turkish word "manav" for a vegetable seller likely originated from the name of this group in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. The debate over whether these "greengrocers" are ethnically Greek or Turkish/Turkmen is considered an outdated issue in [[cultural_and_historical_analysis_of_turkish_identity | Turkish identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

The term "greengrocer" is an administrative and legal term that:
*   Excludes non-Muslims; one had to be Muslim to be considered a "greengrocer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
*   Excludes Yoruks, who were Muslim nomadic people without fixed addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   Excludes the military and ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.

### Islamization and Cultural Changes in Anatolia
A significant portion, possibly the majority, of the Muslim agricultural population in the Hüdavendigar province in the 14th century were likely former Byzantine inhabitants of the region who converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. They adapted to the political and administrative conditions of the new Ottoman state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. This process of conversion was not primarily due to forced conversion or sudden religious enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

One major factor was the Ottoman policy of seizing church and public properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. This led to the decline of Greek monasteries, which were vital institutions for education and training of clergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Without income, these institutions withered, leading to a decline in literacy and religious education among the Christian population over generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. Simultaneously, Muslim religious figures (Dedes, Babas, Hodjas, Kadis) established schools and madrasahs, providing education in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. This shift in institutional support and education facilitated the spread of Islamic culture and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.

The Ottoman conquest also led to a "gold rush" like migration into the region, as it became a land of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Many people came as Turks and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. There were also Armenians migrating from Eastern provinces to Western ones, settling in areas like İzmit, Sakarya, and Adapazarı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. The new arrivals, being Muslim, intermarried with the local population, leading to a mixed populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | impact of historical migrations and cultural changes in Anatolia]] and the complex [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | ethnic and historical background of regions in Türkiye]].

Some traditions among "greengrocers" today, like Hıdrellez celebrations or specific dishes, might originate from pre-Ottoman Greek customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. However, this does not necessarily indicate their Greek origin but rather the continuation of local cultural practices, as new populations learned from existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. The idea of pure racial origins in historical narratives is considered absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

## Hemşinlis in Tortum and İspir

A significant portion of the population in the Tortum and İspir districts (north of Erzurum) are known as Hemşinlis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. They speak a variant of the Hemşin dialect of Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>. Their migration to this region is understood to have occurred after 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. Following the Russian invasion of Erzurum province in 1828-29, a large part (more than half or even two-thirds) of Erzurum's Armenian population withdrew with the Russian army to the region now known as Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. This emptied many villages, leading to a large migration of Hemşinlis from the north into these areas, with most of their villages dating their origins to 1829-1830 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>. This migration exemplifies the [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | impact of historical migrations and cultural changes in Anatolia]] on [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | ethnic and historical background of regions in Türkiye]].

## Greek Presence in Tunceli and Elazığ

As far as is known, there was no significant historical Greek presence in the Tunceli and Elazığ regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>.

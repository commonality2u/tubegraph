This article discusses İsmet İnönü's political and economic policies, drawing from an article written in 2018 and subsequent discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## General Character and Political Approach

İsmet İnönü is described as a figure admired in the history of the Turkish Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He was not a megalomaniac and did not have ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He was a manager who lacked a grand vision or preferred not to express it, operating at a "low level" by the standards of his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. His "Asmalı-cut thyroid fantasies" were often restrained and faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

He maintained distance from "Turkism movements" that proliferated after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. There was an old enmity between İnönü and the "Turkish Hearths" school, represented by figures like Reşit Galip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This enmity intensified into a "blood feud" for Turkists after İnönü broke the pro-Nazi structure in Turkey with arrests in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Turkism, which had distanced itself from the Progress Party tradition, became the main cleavage line of Turkish politics after 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

İnönü undeniably shared the values and goals of the revolutionary regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, during Atatürk's leadership, as Prime Minister, İnönü did not publicly comment on reform projects that deviated from a rational line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He prioritized stability above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Relationship with Atatürk and the Republican Regime

İnönü played a leading role in the "bloody suppression" of the Kurdish rebellion in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, he was seen as moderate during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His contradiction of Atatürk regarding Dersim led to his dismissal and "political death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Unlike Atatürk, İnönü's interest in Western culture and law was sincere, not for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. While Atatürk's musical taste was limited to Safiye Ayla and dance tunes, İnönü cultivated a love for classical music, acquired in Yemen, and actively shared it with the people of Ankara during his time as "national chief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. He is almost solely responsible for the classical music tradition in Turkey, even if it is weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Upon assuming leadership, İnönü made political statements that represented "one of the most comprehensive and courageous rights in the history of the Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He brought back figures like Karabekir, Rauf Orbay, Halide Edip, and Mehmet Akif Ersoy, previously considered "traitors," into the national hero cadre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In 1938, the removal of Atatürk's picture from money and other places was perhaps a first step to erase the traces of a 15-year "power intoxication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, the cult of the founder God persisted after 1950 and intensified after 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Atatürk and İnönü were close allies for 17 of Atatürk's 19 years in power, governing the country together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. After Atatürk's death, İnönü, as the party's representative, never achieved the same "absolute sovereignty" as Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. There was always an openly or implicitly unhappy faction that kept its distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

Regarding İnönü's rise to power after Atatürk, it is one of the most fundamental and enigmatic questions in Turkish Republic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. İnönü left politics in 1937 and was removed from the Prime Ministry for about 13 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. He attended the Republic Day events on October 29, 1937, as a civilian, and the stadium erupted with cheers for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. This made İnönü "very restless, very scared, very disturbed," leading him to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. From that point, İnönü was erased from public discourse, and mentioning his name was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. He was under police surveillance, like purged figures in the Soviet Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. His unanimous election as president the day after Atatürk's death is surprising given this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. He was the most logical candidate, but the consensus among powerful, ambitious individuals, who could "cut each other to the truth without blinking an eye," is unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. The timing of this decision before Atatürk's death remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.

## Economic Policies

İnönü's economic policies were cautious and even "arrested" because he understood the weakness and powerlessness of state finances better than anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He believed that if there was no money, one should be careful with spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. After 1946, with the [[United States foreign policy and financial adjustments | United States]] opening "credit taps," he allowed a rapid economic expansion policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. While conservative in finance in the 1930s and 40s, his post-1946 policy encouraged investment, processing, and factory establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He was accused of being strict and cowardly in the earlier period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Social Reforms and Development

İnönü did not show interest in "flashy symbolic reforms," possibly due to the outbreak of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, he initiated more practical revolutions, such as the planting of tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur, providing permanent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Other significant services include the eradication of Menemen and malaria in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

He aimed to eliminate "Kuvayi nationalist gang members" surrounding his predecessor's rule and promote young, educated cadres, including figures like Hasan Ali Yücel and İsmail Tonguç <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While supportive of Village Institutes, he faced reactions that eventually led to their closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Land reform projects in Urfa and Aegean also emerged during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## World War II and Neutrality

Turkey was kept out of the "disaster of the two World Wars" during İnönü's tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The Turkish army's situation in 1940 was described as "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Entering the war on the side of the Allies would have been a "gain and a loss" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The fates of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which fought and were defeated, were "horrifying," leaving wounds that generations would not overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It is "hard to even think" about what would have happened if Turkey had joined Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### War Years Hardship and Popular Perception
The public suffered during the war years, with bread sold on ration cards and peasants subjected to forced labor and military pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This tarnished İnönü's name for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, the suffering of Turkish peasants was "a drop in the ocean" compared to what happened in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

A contrasting public perception exists: the First World War, despite terrible losses, hunger, epidemics, and social upheaval, is remembered with "good intentions," while the Second World War, overcome with ration cards, led to hatred for its administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. One possible reason for this difference is that the first war involved "plunder" and a "tremendous wealth transfer," affecting popular attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The genocide and plunder policies of the Union and Progress regime during the First World War, where the country was destroyed but properties were seized, resonated differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. In contrast, during the Second World War, measures like the Wealth Tax of 1942 and conscription of 20-22 year olds were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Diplomacy and Neutrality
The Allies' long persuasion processes regarding Turkey's entry into the war were not solely about participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. A key issue was preventing Germany from entering the war on Turkey's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. They also sought to prevent Turkey from selling chrome, essential for high-quality steel, to Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

İnönü skillfully navigated an "extraordinarily difficult" period during WWII, avoiding a disaster that would turn the country into a "fire pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. He pursued a "very two-faced policy" domestically to please both the British and Americans and keep them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. When Germany neared defeat, the Saraçoğlu and Peker team were purged, replaced by a government more amenable to the British and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

## Post-1950 Political Career

İnönü's career after 1950 demonstrated his "cautious personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. He was the first and possibly only "National Chief" to leave power through an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. His authority and accumulated personality played a role in the aftermath of the May 27, 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He "put on the brakes" a few months after the coup with another internal coup, shifting towards a softer, "half-baked democracy" or transition program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

However, his later political actions, such as his "town politician fights" with Demirel, support for the military sentence in 1971, and struggle to retain office against young Ecevit at 87, are seen as indefensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. These actions damaged his reputation and contributed to the "fossilization" and deadlock of several major issues in Turkish politics that persist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Conflict with Talat Aydemir
Inönü's conflict with Talat Aydemir is a continuation of the 1960 military coup process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. Within the army, two tendencies existed: a "radical revolutionary" group influenced by National Socialist winds from Arab countries, believing civilians were incapable of governing and that the army should take the lead, even through "cutting off many heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Alparslan Türkeş and Talat Aydemir were part of this school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

The other tendency, represented by Cemal Gürsel and Madanoğlu, was more institutional, believing the Democrat Party had lost control and needed a cleanup, after which the country should return to a party order in line with NATO and America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. İnönü clearly sided with the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. The radical officers were purged from the National Unity Committee in October 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. For the next decade, this radical faction repeatedly attempted coups and formed secret political organizations within the army, keeping Turkey "on edge" until the 1980 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Dersim Rebellion (1936)
While İnönü played a leading role in the 1925 Kurdish rebellion suppression, he was seen as moderate during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Some local tribes resisted state oppression, leading the government to declare a rebellion, burn villages, and carry out a "bloody period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. İnönü's parliamentary speech in 1937 stated that the rebellion was suppressed, security problems were over, and the focus should be on welfare and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This speech directly contradicted Atatürk's preferred line, causing Atatürk to "Kudur Kudur" (go wild) and leave the assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. İnönü was subsequently recommended to take leave and Celal Bayar became Prime Minister, leading to the "second and real bloody period" of the Dersim operation, which included "genocide," "tens of thousands of people killed," and families torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This movement was directly commanded by Atatürk, who monitored operations daily and gave instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

### Purging of Non-Muslim Populations
The 1934 Fatih events involved an attack on Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. With World War II on the horizon, Turkey had a policy of expelling the Jewish population west of Istanbul, including in Edirne, Tekirdağ, Hayrabolu, and Çanakkale, preventing them from residing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. When they came to Istanbul, nothing was done to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. Gangs attacked Jews, broke shops, and drew red lines, while officials refused protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This was part of a broader policy to gather the non-Muslim population in Istanbul, also seeing the "purification" of remaining Armenian communities in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. The motivation behind this, whether stupidity, racism, or perceived state necessity, is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

#### Greek Community in Istanbul
The 1963-64 Greek exile in Istanbul was not related to the 1955 September 6-7 events, which were a "pogrom" driven by Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In 1963, following the collapse of the two-community structure of the Republic of Cyprus, around 50,000 Greek passport holders living in Istanbul were expelled within a week, losing their belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This incident was personal for the speaker, whose apartment building in Şişli had five Greek families and one Turkish family, and saw the expulsions firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Families were divided, and individuals with mixed Turkish-Greek marriages were separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. This was retaliation for the Cyprus incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

Under the Treaty of Lausanne, all Greek populations in Turkey were deported, with the exception of Imroz, Bozcaada, and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. These islands were given to Turkey due to their security importance for the Dardanelles Strait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The Greek population of Istanbul remained because Turkey's economy would have collapsed without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. An agreement in 1935 allowed Istanbul Greeks to obtain Greek citizenship, offering conveniences like university education in Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Turkey promised non-discrimination and protection from deportation in return for Greece leaving Turks in Western Thrace untouched, a balance that largely held until 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### The "Atatürk Cult" After 1950
The "cult of the founder God" continued after 1950 and intensified after 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In the early years of the Democrat Party (after 1950), the Atatürk cult was resurrected with great enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. This included enacting an Atatürk protection law, prohibiting insult to his memory, and reviving the Anıtkabir project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Busts of Atatürk were mandated for all provinces and government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. This was an "organized, systematic, conscious policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

This re-emphasis on Atatürk in 1950 was likely a political decision during a "risky transition period" from a single-party dictatorship to a democratic election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. There was a fear of opening "old books" and trying those responsible for past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. An agreement was made between the Republican People's Party and the Democrat Party to make the "culture of Atatürk the only unquestionable truth" and a national unity symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. However, this "mortar" weakened during the Democrat Party period and was later reimposed by soldiers in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.

### Alleged Armenian Origin
The claim that İnönü was originally Armenian is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. His family fled Çukurca district of Hakkari during Assyrian massacres (1939-42) to Bitlis, then migrated to Malatya, and later Izmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:05">[02:10:05]</a>. There is no truth to this claim, nor that he was Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### İnönü and Kuvayi Milliye
It is stated that İnönü was not a nationalist like Kuvayi Milliye figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. He suppressed and destroyed the Kuvayi Milliye movement. He joined the Ankara movement from day one, advocating for establishing a regular army and institutionalizing the struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. In the 1926 Independence Tribunals incident, Kılıç Ali, a figure associated with the Kuvayi Milliye's "ruthless and bloody elements," was brought to court by İnönü's mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. İnönü, as a state administrator, would view Kılıç Ali as a "punisher," representing two different mentalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

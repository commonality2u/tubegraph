The religious and cultural landscape of Armenians has undergone significant transformations throughout history, influenced by geopolitical shifts and internal dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.

## Pre-Christian Eras

Armenians originally adhered to ancient pagan religions, featuring old gods and Iranian traditions, particularly from the 6th or 5th centuries BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. Before this, the Urartian period had its own distinct pantheon of gods and forms of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.

When the Armenian country came under Iranian political sovereignty in the 6th century BC, a new series of gods and a new temple model emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:34">[02:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.

### Hellenistic Influence

In the 1st or 2nd century BC, during the time of kings like Arda Şef and Dikran (around 80 BC), Greek gods were imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:24">[02:23:24]</a>. Statues of Greek gods and goddesses were brought in, and new temples were built, particularly in the Erzincan region, the westernmost part of historic Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:48">[02:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:17">[02:23:17]</a>. This policy involved establishing an imported ideology and religion with their priests, although some priests refused to go to deeper Armenian regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:34">[02:24:34]</a>. The worship of figures like Zeus, Apollo, and Hephaestus was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:58">[02:24:58]</a>. Notably, after approximately 350 years, the names of Greek gods, like Zeus, transitioned to Iranian names such as Hormuz, reflecting a shift towards Eastern cultural imperialism over Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:45">[02:25:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:17">[02:26:17]</a>.

## Conversion to Christianity

Christianity arrived as a reaction to this cultural imperialism around the beginning of the 3rd or 4th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. This was a striking process, particularly within the Armenian Kingdom, which was largely under Iranian cultural influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:34">[02:26:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:45">[02:26:45]</a>. Through a bloody and difficult internal struggle, the king was persuaded to accept the new religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:49">[02:26:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. This conversion led to the systematic destruction of all pagan temples and the construction of churches and monasteries in their place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:30">[02:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>. Priests were killed, and the church seized vast temple properties, including lands, villages, and towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:19">[02:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:33">[02:27:33]</a>. The administrator of the church, Azizi, and his family quickly became the largest property owners in Armenia, effectively becoming hereditary chief priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:49">[02:27:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>. This entire process, purified from national and religious myths, offers new sociological perspectives on [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>.

## Armenian Identity and Religion

From the 4th century onwards, being Christian became synonymous with being Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:14">[02:29:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:17">[02:29:17]</a>. Armenians quickly severed ties with the broader Greek (Orthodox) church, adopting a unique sectarian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>. Until the 19th century, belonging to this specific church, its culture, traditions, and ceremonies was the essence of being Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. To leave the religion was to leave the nation, effectively becoming Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:12">[02:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.

This phenomenon was rooted in the education system. Until the 19th century, education in the Ottoman Empire was religious; children attended mosque, church, or synagogue schools according to their sect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:37">[02:30:37]</a>. Secular schools did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:04">[02:31:04]</a>. Consequently, if an Armenian left their community and religion, their child would attend a Muslim school, learning Arabic script and Turkish, the prevailing language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:13">[02:31:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:25">[02:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:33">[02:31:33]</a>. Within a single generation, children would grow up without learning Armenian, adopting Turkish and Arabic as cultural languages, leading to rapid [[cultural_and_linguistic_shifts_among_armenians | linguistic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:41">[02:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:03">[02:32:03]</a>. This process quickly erased any sense of connection to their Armenian past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:40">[02:32:40]</a>.

## Modernity and Further Shifts

The mid-18th century brought significant crises to this traditional identity with the advent of modernity and European influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:55">[03:39:55]</a>.

### Rise of Armenian Catholicism and Protestantism

Some Armenians grew disaffected with the Armenian Church's "bigotry" and perceived "exploitation system," leading them to seek alternatives like Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:34">[03:43:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:41">[03:43:41]</a>. Becoming Catholic was an act of protest against the Armenian Church's contemporary dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:46">[03:44:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:01">[03:50:01]</a>. Later, Protestantism emerged as an even more radical break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:06">[03:50:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>. Approximately 10% of Anatolian Armenians converted to Catholicism, and 1-2% converted to Protestantism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:17">[03:51:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:21">[03:52:21]</a>. These converts were no longer considered "Armenian" in the traditional sense, as the terminology of the period viewed each sect as a separate "nation" (e.g., Armenian Catholic nation, National Gregorian nation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:28">[03:53:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:45">[03:54:45]</a>.

### Re-defining Armenian Identity

In the latter half of the 19th century, particularly after the 1860s and 1870s, Armenian intellectuals in Istanbul and Tbilisi began to define Armenian identity on a new basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:18">[03:58:18]</a>. The question arose of what common identity could unite Armenians, Catholics, and Protestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:08">[03:56:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:28">[03:56:28]</a>.

### Mass Conversion to Islam

Simultaneously, in the rural areas of [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | Eastern Anatolia]], many Armenian villagers, disillusioned with the church's inability to protect them from Kurdish attacks despite paying taxes, began converting to Islam in significant numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:01">[03:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:11">[03:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:46">[03:37:46]</a>. This was often without the fanfare associated with Catholic or Protestant conversions and sometimes involved joining Sufi orders like the Naqshbandi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:36">[03:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Research in regions like Gevaş Alızanla Bahçe Saray, south of Lake Van, shows a radical decrease in the Armenian population from the 1840s onwards, with villages previously almost entirely Armenian dropping to 30% Armenian by 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:33">[03:59:33]</a>. This decline was not due to massacres but primarily to these conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:39">[03:59:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:42">[03:59:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:46">[03:59:46]</a>.

This "change of side" was often accompanied by deep hostility. In subsequent periods (1880, 1895, 1915), those who burned Armenian churches and killed priests were often Armenians from the previous generation who had converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:05">[04:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:05">[04:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This reveals new perspectives on [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide | 19th-century history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:18">[03:38:18]</a>, particularly the significant role of the Kurdish element in oppressing Armenians prior to 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. The Ottoman state was historically seen as a protector against Kurdish attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:55">[03:54:55]</a>. However, in 1915, the Committee of Union and Progress consciously used Kurdish lords, their networks, and people as subcontractors in their "annihilation project" against Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:13">[03:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:50">[03:36:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This was done by assuring them state backing and immunity from prosecution for their crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:22">[03:37:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:29">[03:37:29]</a>.

This pattern suggests a deep hostility towards the Armenian Church itself, rather than just the Armenian nation, particularly in the 1880s and 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:50">[03:57:50]</a>. Only after extensive looting and the lack of further targets did some masses realize the danger they had put themselves in with the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:03">[03:58:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:24">[03:58:24]</a>.

In recent decades, the attitude of Kurds towards the Armenian issue has changed radically, a positive development that some hope Turks will emulate in overcoming their own prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:50">[03:58:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>.

## Urumns: A Case Study in Cultural Shifts

The "Urumns" are a group living in Georgia and, to some extent, Russia, who are members of the Greek Orthodox Church but whose sole mother tongue is Turkish, specifically with a heavy Erzurum accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. They have Greek names but their family names can reveal Turkish origins, like "Yellow Mahmutoglu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>.

The common narrative is that in 1828-1829, after the war, Christians, primarily Armenians, but also Greeks, migrated en masse from Northeastern Türkiye (Erzurum, Muş, Erzincan, Trabzon provinces) to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. However, there is a suspicion that some Turks, having no connection to Greekness, saw this as an opportunity for a better life in Russia and adopted a Greek identity to migrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>. This highlights the complex [[cultural_and_linguistic_shifts_among_armenians | cultural and linguistic shifts]] that occurred in the region, blurring traditional ethnic and religious lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>.

Turkey's political history has been marked by a recurring pattern of military interventions, often leading to similar outcomes despite varying initial motivations. These events highlight persistent challenges to democratic governance and the influence of both internal and external factors on the nation's political trajectory.

## The March 12 Memorandum (1971)

On March 12, 1971, the Turkish military issued a memorandum, which led to significant political upheaval. Citizens at the time insistently wanted commentary on political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Events and Immediate Aftermath
The public awoke to news of a military memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Consequently, the Süleyman Demirel government was forced to resign the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Initially, a "reform government" was established, led by Nihat Erim, which brought in many technocrats and young bureaucrats freshly imported from America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This government lasted approximately one to two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

Following this, martial law was declared, and a "regime of terror" was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. Progressive and Atatürkist cadres were purged, and individuals described as "worst kinds of police chiefs" and "torturers" like Faik and Sadi Koçaş took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. The country was governed by these figures for years until the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

### The True Instigators
Later revelations, particularly through documents and books published by Süleyman Demirel's disciple Cüneyt Arcayürek, indicated that the coup involved several stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>:
*   An initial coup attempt by leftist or Kemalist officers within the army was stopped at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
*   These officers were then invited to join a common platform for a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   Subsequently, the leftist elements were eliminated, and a radical right-wing nationalist group, believing the nation "only understands sticks," became the dominant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

### Hypothetical March 9 Coup
There was speculation about what would have happened if a March 9 coup, led by figures like Air Force Commander Batur and Land Forces Commander Faruk Gürler, had taken place instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. In a country under [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | NATO]] control and lacking autonomy in international relations at that time, such a coup was not truly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. It is suggested that even if a "leftist" coup had succeeded briefly, the [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | Republic of Turkey]] would have quickly reverted to its "factory settings," much like the outcome of the March 12 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

## The May 27 Coup (1960)

The May 27, 1960, intervention followed a similar process to later military regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   This coup was described as extremely radical, with a group of Atatürkist officers believing that traditional democratic parties could not effectively govern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
*   They came to power on May 27, 1960, aiming to "complete the task Atatürk left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   However, within five months, these radical elements were purged, sent abroad, and warned not to interfere again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   A more conservative and static order, aligned with the "basic needs of capitalism and [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | NATO]]", was then formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Recurring Patterns and Broader Implications

The pattern observed in May 1960 and March 1971 was consistent. Even if a left-wing coup had succeeded on March 9, 1971, the outcome would likely not have been significantly different from the March 12 "left-right coalition" coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. After a brief period of purported reform, all radical elements were removed, and the "old-fashioned Janissary system and order" became dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

This consistency suggests that, in a country heavily influenced by external powers, significant autonomy for "domestic" political change through military means was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### The Challenges of Political Change
The discussion of these historical military regimes provides context for understanding the challenges of political change in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] today. There are serious doubts about whether elections can bring an end to an obvious dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. To achieve such a change, very strong "trump cards" are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>:
1.  **Public Uprising**: A massive public revolt where security forces struggle to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Such a situation is currently absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
2.  **Military Backing**: A significant portion of the military being strongly in favor of a government change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This situation is also not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
3.  **Foreign Power Intervention**: One or more countries holding significant influence over the state demanding an election and a change of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. However, the influence of such foreign powers, specifically mentioning the US, has diminished in [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkey]], with "many of the fingers of its codes" being cut off, reducing its ability to control events compared to previous eras like 1950, 1960, or 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

Given these conditions, expecting a change of power solely through elections is considered unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This perspective underscores a consistent theme in [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkey's political history]]: the outcomes of major political shifts, including military interventions, are often shaped by a complex interplay of internal dynamics and external geopolitical realities.

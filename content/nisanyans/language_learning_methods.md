## Analytical Approach to Language Learning

The speaker's personal method for learning a new language involves several steps:
*   **Grammar Study**: First, they carefully read a grammar book for about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Dictionary Use**: They keep a simple dictionary close at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.
*   **Active Reading**: They then select a text and attempt to read it, utilizing both the grammar book and dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
*   **Personal Vocabulary Building**: Every unknown word encountered is written down in a notebook, which serves as a personal dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. This process of reviewing and clearing the notebook helps solidify vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

## General Approaches to Language Learning

There are two primary methods for learning a language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>:
*   **Learning by Reading**: This method involves extensive reading and the use of reference materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   **Learning by Talking**: This approach focuses on oral communication and conversational practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

The effectiveness often depends on an individual's natural inclination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

## The Role of Age in Language Acquisition

The speaker suggests that for individuals over the age of 25, the chances of learning a language well are significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. They recommend learning languages before reaching 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

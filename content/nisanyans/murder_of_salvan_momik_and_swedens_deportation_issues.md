Salvan Momik, a Chaldean individual, gained international attention for publicly burning a copy of the Quran in Sweden. His murder has sparked debate and various theories regarding its perpetrator and motive, especially given his ongoing [[Deportation period experiences of the family | deportation]] proceedings in Sweden.

## Background of Salvan Momik
Salvan Momik was identified as a Chaldean, sharing the same ethnic background as Hakkari Nestorians [01:48:47]. He originated from a Chaldean village near Mosul [01:59:56]. During the Iraqi Civil War, his community experienced significant suffering, fighting, and losses [01:09:00]. This personal history reportedly instilled in him a "deep and justified hatred towards Islamists and Muslims in general" [01:15:15].

## The Quran Burning Incident
Momik first appeared publicly about a year before his death, burning a copy of the Quran in front of the Turkish Consulate in Sweden [01:18:14]. This act was controversial, and doubts about its purpose and background were expressed at the time [01:18:25]. While it could be seen as an emotional reaction stemming from his background, it was also used in the context of Sweden's NATO accession [01:19:48]. The timing of his action, taken at a point where an "absurd decision" regarding Sweden's NATO entry was being made, raised serious suspicions [01:19:56].

## Sweden's Deportation Proceedings
Following the Quran burning incident, Sweden decided to [[Personal experiences of deportation and its impact | deport]] Momik [02:00:11].
The sequence of events was:
1.  His residence permit was revoked [02:00:14].
2.  He was granted a temporary residence permit [02:00:17].
3.  He illegally traveled to Norway to seek asylum [02:00:24].
4.  Norwegian police apprehended him and extradited him back to Sweden [02:00:26].
5.  At the time of discussion, the Swedish court was reportedly close to making a final [[Migration Issues in Europe | deportation]] decision [02:00:39].

This bureaucratic process is described as standard in Europe, with hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people constantly appealing to asylum courts, seeking higher court reviews, postponing [[Immigration trends and political impact in the US and Europe | deportation]] decisions, or living illegally [02:00:51]. Momik was considered one such individual caught in this "bureaucratic wheel" [02:01:15]. His situation presented a dilemma for Sweden: [[Migration issues in the United States and Europe | deportation]] would be a significant problem, but not [[Migration issues in the United States and Europe | deporting]] him would be an even greater one [02:01:20]. He had become a problem for Sweden and almost for Norway [02:01:32].

## Theories on the Murder
The murder of Salvan Momik has led to several hypotheses about the perpetrator and motive:
*   **Swedish Police/Authorities:** The Swedish police are considered the "first suspect" [02:01:40].
*   **Foreign Powers:** If Momik's Quran burning was encouraged and guided by a foreign country, he would be a "very dangerous person" due to his knowledge [02:01:59]. In such a scenario, those who used him would also have an interest in eliminating him [02:02:06].
*   **Islamists:** There is a possibility that Islamists, either due to "stupidity" or "ideological ambition," could commit such a murder [02:02:27].
*   **Actors seeking to incriminate Islamists:** The murder could have been committed under the guise of Islamists, or by using an Islamist, specifically to make Islamists "look bad" [02:02:36].

Ultimately, the exact perpetrators and their motivations remain unknown [01:17:57].

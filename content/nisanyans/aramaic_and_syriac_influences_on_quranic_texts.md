This article presents analyses concerning the text of the Quran, aiming to understand it more clearly from a broader, non-Islamic framework of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This approach involves examining specific phrases, expressions, and narratives in the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The analysis touches on four main topics, three of which have been previously discussed or written about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These include the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, which is argued not to be a work of revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, and the story of the Seven Sleepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Story of the Seven Sleepers and the Ambiguity of "Rakim"

The story of the Seven Sleepers, as narrated in Surah Kahf (chapter 18) of the Quran, tells of seven young believers oppressed and locked in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. After sleeping for hundreds of years, they woke up, unaware of the time passed, and sent one to the market where his old coin astonished people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This story is found in multiple locations, including Ephesus, Tarsus, and Syria, where caves associated with the Seven Sleepers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In Islamic belief, it's considered an allegory of the Apocalypse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The Quranic narrative itself presents ambiguities, stating: "Some say 3 people. Some say 5 people, some say 7 people. None of them know anything. Don't ask them. It starts with O Muhammad. It means how many there are. Actually, it is unclear according to the text of the Quran" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Similarly, the duration of their sleep is ambiguous: "They stayed in the cave for 300 years but there are also those who say 309 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This creates an impression that the author of the Quran, or Allah, lacks sufficient knowledge on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Within this narrative, a key ambiguous term appears in verse 9: "Or do you think that our verses or miracles are the example of the owners of the cave and the rakim?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. While "Kahf" means cave, "Rakim" is described as a "completely esr word" with no clear meaning in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Interpretations of "Rakim"

Classical commentators and modern Turkish translations offer varied interpretations for `Rakim`:
*   **Firuz Abadin's dictionary** gives multiple interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Ibn Abbas**, considered the "father of the commentators," provided different interpretations:
    *   The name of a valley next to Eile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   The name of a city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   The name of the mountain where the cave is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Mujahit's commentary** suggests `Rakim` is the name of their building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Dahak's commentary** states that `Rakim` is the name of the Cave itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Said Bin Jubayr** interpreted `Rakim` as the name of the tablets on which the men's story was written, placed at the cave entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Turkish translations also reflect this ambiguity:
*   **Elmalılı Tafsir** interpreted `Rakim` as "the stone inscription on which the names of the Companions of the Cave and the Rakim were written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   The **old interpretation of the Directorate of Religious Affairs** interpreted `Rakim` as "the Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, relating it to "to make a sign, to symbolize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   The **new interpretation** of the Directorate of Religious Affairs translates "Companions of Rakim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Ahmet Tekin's interpretation** suggests `Rakim` refers to "monuments erected on them" or "written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Yaşar Nuriye Öztürk** translated it as "Inscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

The original Quranic text further complicates understanding by saying "Companions of the Cave and Rakim," leaving it unclear if `Rakim` refers to a separate group or completes the "Companions of the Cave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### The Syriac Origin of "Rakim"

The story of the Seven Sleepers existed in pre-Quranic sources, with the oldest known version attributed to [[evolution_of_quranic_texts_across_different_regions | Jacob of Sarug]], a Monophysite founder who lived from 451 to 521 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This story, widely told throughout Byzantium and especially among the Syriacs, took place in Ephesus during the reign of Emperor Decius around 250 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Gregory of Tours, a 6th-century Latin historian, also recounted the story, stating he heard it from a Syrian source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Notably, the dog Kıtmir is mentioned only in Islamic sources, not in earlier versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The word "Rakim" is proposed to be a misreading of "Dekus" (Decius) in Syriac script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. In old Syriac scripts (Estrangelo or Jewish Syriac), the letters for 'D' (Dalath) and 'R' (Rish) are very similar in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. In modern Syriac, dots are added to distinguish them, but these dots didn't exist in older scripts like Aramaic or Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Similarly, the final 'M' (Mim) and 'S' (Semkath) letters can also be confused, as both are round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Thus, "Dekus" written in Syriac script could easily be misread as "Rakim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This suggests that the error is a spelling mistake, not originating in Arabic, but from a misreading of a Syriac or Aramaic text, likely transmitted orally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This implies that the person who told the story to Muhammad might have poorly read the Aramaic source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Understanding this requires consulting Syriac religious scholars and Christian saints from the 5th and 6th centuries, which is an idea often foreign to the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

### Written Tradition in Arabia

While Arabic script was not yet widely established as a written language during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, there was a well-known Aramaic writing tradition among Christians and Jews in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. In Mecca, a cosmopolitan city on trade routes, there were likely people familiar with Aramaic script, including merchants, slaves, and individuals from Sassanid Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Some individuals close to Muhammad, such as Khadijah's cousin, were known to have learned Christian scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. In Medina, Jews spoke Aramaic and used it for sacred affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This context suggests that the transfer of information from Syriac to Arabic, even if through oral transmission of a misread text, was plausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

## The Term "Huri" and Zoroastrian Influence

Another enigmatic term in the Quran is "Huri," found five times in Surah Dukhan (Q. 44:54) and Surah Tur (Q. 52:20, 23), and also mentioned as "hidden in tents" in Q. 55:72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. This word "has no Arabic meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. While Arabic linguists agree it's feminine and plural, its singular form and root meaning are debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Interpretations often link it to "white" (from the H-V-R root) or "eye," leading to descriptions like "White-eyed" or "big-eyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Dictionaries like Kamus, a 15th-century Arabic dictionary, define "Hur" as having eyes with "very white and very black white, like in gazelles and cows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

Hadith provide more specific, though often absurd, descriptions of houris:
*   Their leg bones' marrow can be seen through their skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   They do not pee, defecate, or spit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   They have combs made of gold, and their sweat smells like musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   They are all identical, with no genetic diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   Their height is 60 cubits (about 40 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
*   Their faces are white and bright like the full moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   Their bones shine like pearls and rubies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   They do not have menstrual periods and children are not born from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### Zoroastrian Roots of "Huri"

The term "Huri" is argued to derive from the Persian word "Huru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>, meaning "beautiful-faced." This connection is highlighted by the *Arda Viraz Namah*, a 5th-century Zoroastrian text written in the Pahlavi language (pre-Islamic Persian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. The text describes a spiritual journey where the protagonist, Viraz, encounters his own piety and virtues in the form of a beautiful woman with "magnificent breasts that please the eye and soothe the soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. When asked, she replies, "I am the beauty of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, and is described as a "beautiful-faced woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

The prefix "Hu-" in Persian means "beautiful" (similar to Greek "eu-" in "euthanasia") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>, and "-ru" means "face" or "soul" (as in "Gülru" for rose-faced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. Thus, "Huru" translates to "beautiful-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This allegory of one's soul appearing as a beautiful woman in the afterlife is a common Zoroastrian concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.

Further back, in the older Avestan language (the language of original Zoroastrian texts), the term "hura" is used to describe a "beautiful-faced" virtuous, religious, or moral person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This concept, initially abstract, later became concretized into the image of a beautiful woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. The term "Huri" in Islamic sources appears to be a direct transfer from this Zoroastrian concept, but its meaning became "completely dispersed" in Arabic, leading to the need for extensive Hadith interpretations to define it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. This [[textual_analysis_of_the_quran | textual analysis of the Quran]] points to potential [[influence_of_cultural_and_religious_dynamics_in_the_middle_east | cultural and religious dynamics]] at play in the formation of Quranic terminology.

## The Concept of "Gehenna" and its Evolution

The term "Gehenna" (Hell in English, often rendered as "Jahannam" in Arabic) also shows [[evolution_of_quranic_texts_across_different_regions | evolution of Quranic texts across different regions]] and [[exploration_of_ambiguous_terms_in_islamic_texts | influences from Jewish and Christian traditions]]. Its origin lies in the "Hinnom Valley" (Hebrew: *Gey Hinnom*), a geographical location next to Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

### From Physical Valley to Place of Punishment

In the Torah, the Hinnom Valley is mentioned 11 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. While four instances are purely geographical descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, the other seven refer to specific events, namely the practice of idolaters building altars (tophet) and passing children through fire as a dedication ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. This custom, interpreted as child sacrifice in Jewish and Christian literature, was later seen as a purification ceremony where children passed through fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. King Josiah destroyed this altar, making the valley a "disaster place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

The Prophet Jeremiah's book, written after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, further develops the symbolism of the Hinnom Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. Jeremiah prophesies that the bodies of cursed Jewish people will be thrown into the valley, to be eaten by wolves and birds, causing the valley to be called the "Valley of Tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. This narrative fuels a polemic, transforming the valley from a physical location into a symbol of cosmic crime, sin, and punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

### Development of the Concept of Hell

By the 2nd century onwards, the idea of fire in the Hinnom Valley begins to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. While the Torah doesn't explicitly state Hinnom as a place for the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>, later Jewish texts, like the Babylonian Talmud, explicitly link it to hell. Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai (d. ~90 AD) describes two palm trees in the Hinnom Valley with smoke rising between them, signifying "the gate of hell where sinners will go after death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

In Jesus's teachings, the term "Gehenna" is used 13 times, no longer referring to a geographical valley, but constantly speaking of the disposal of a body or organ that sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. Luke implies that not only the body but also the soul can be cast into Gehenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. Mark mentions the "never-ending fire of Gehenna," interpreted as evidence of an eternal place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This demonstrates a clear evolution from a concrete, physical location to an abstract, spiritual place of eternal torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>.

The transformation of "Gey Hinnom" into "Gehenna" and then "Jahannam" reflects the shift in religious understanding of punishment from earthly consequences to an afterlife concept. The shift from "G" to "C" (J) in Arabic (e.g., *gamal abdl nasır* pronounced as *jamal*) is a known phonetic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. The discussion of whether Hell is eternal or temporary in Jewish tradition (e.g., Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai vs. Rabbi Simeon Ben Laki) mirrors later debates in Islamic theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. This gradual concretization and intensification of punishment in the afterlife is argued to be a logical progression driven by the need to reconcile observed injustices in the world with the concept of a just God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. This [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran | historical transcription of the Quran]] and related texts shows how concepts evolved over centuries, from around 600 BC to 600 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

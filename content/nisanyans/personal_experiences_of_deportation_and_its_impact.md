The speaker recounts a personal experience of deportation from Greece, which occurred unexpectedly exactly three years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This event was described as a "big shock" that "shook my life very seriously," leading the speaker to state they have "really come to myself since that day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The established life in Türkiye collapsed, and attempts to rebuild a good life in Greece also collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Reasons for Deportation

For years, the speaker questioned the rationale behind the decision, specifically "why was such a decision reached" and "in what sense I posed a threat to the national security of Greece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Initially, the speaker attributed the deportation to the "bureaucratic stupidity or racism or narrow-mindedness" of the Greek state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

However, the speaker later revised this opinion, stating "I was wrong here Turkey is behind the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It appeared that Türkiye was "pressuring Greece" for the speaker's extradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This incident occurred in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Greece, in response, informed the Turkish side that extradition was "not possible" and opted to deport the speaker to avoid a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Therefore, the speaker concludes that Greece's direct fault in the matter, beyond cowardice, was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Legal and Personal Ramifications

The deportation by Greece was deemed "problematic" under both Greek and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is because the speaker is "married to a Greek person," meaning the deportation effectively implied the deportation of a Greek citizen spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The experience served as "an Awakening" for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While acknowledging that some might question why this wasn't foreseen, the speaker admitted that "sometimes the ability to comprehend is lacking in some people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

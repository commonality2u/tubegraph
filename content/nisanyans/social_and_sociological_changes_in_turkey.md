The 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey was anticipated with expectations of grand ceremonies and enthusiastic celebrations, with some even predicting significant political events like a new constitution [00:01:48]. However, these expectations were not met [00:02:16]. Compared to the 80th and 90th-anniversary celebrations, the 100th anniversary was notably subdued [00:02:23]. The government's policy appeared to be to make the 100th anniversary an ordinary and unimportant event [00:02:51], although some small groups attempted to create a lively atmosphere with demonstrations and meaningful poems about Atatürk [00:03:10].

## Perceived Continuity vs. Radical Change

From a historical perspective, the Republic of Turkey can be viewed as an episode in the ongoing history of the Turkish state, a process that has been flowing since at least 1453, potentially even longer [00:04:08]. Similar to France, which transitioned from a kingdom to a republic, or Russia and China, which underwent significant regime changes, the underlying continuity of the state and its people often outweighs the differences introduced by a new political system [00:05:00].

### State Tradition and Name
In the general [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | historical and social overview of Turkey and its evolution]], the Republic is considered a period, much like the Abdulhamid, rise, stagnation, or decline periods of the Ottoman Empire [00:06:19]. Despite the change in the state's name, the country has always been known as Türkiye to foreigners [00:06:38]. The Ottoman Empire itself did not have a specific name, being referred to as the "World Empire" [00:07:08]. Even outside official documents, the common name for this land remained Türkiye [00:07:23].

### Institutional and Political Continuities
There is a clear continuity in the state's self-narrative, linking figures like Fatih, Yavuz, and Abdulhamid to Mustafa Kemal and Tayyip Erdoğan [00:07:43]. State institutions also show significant continuity; for instance, the Turkish Armed Forces and Gendarmerie Organization celebrate centuries of foundation, and organizations like the land registry, mapping directorate, and population administration maintain unbroken traditions [00:08:03]. The Republic of Turkey is largely a revised version of the Ottoman State, adapted to new conditions [00:09:02].

The ruling cadres of the new Republic were largely continuous with those of the old state [01:11:34]. Individuals who graduated from elite schools and served as commanders in the old regime's armies established the new regime, maintaining the state's continuity [01:11:41].

### Legal and Linguistic Continuity
Ottoman laws had already begun radical changes and reforms based on European models as early as the 1840s, starting with the Commercial Code and continuing with Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes [01:12:14]. The Republic also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State [01:12:53], and many traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices continued [01:13:08].

Turkish remained the dominant language, although significant reforms in its usage style were implemented from the 1930s onwards [01:13:26]. Despite these changes, Turkish writers from the Abdulhamid era could still be understood with minor stylistic adjustments until the 1950s and 60s [01:13:52].

### Population and Identity
The collective identity of the people represented by the state has not fundamentally changed [01:09:28]. Historically, this populace referred to themselves as Muslims, but later, the name "Turkish" was adopted [01:09:42]. These two groups largely overlap, representing different guises of the same cluster [01:10:01]. Outside of Arabs, Ottoman Muslims were consistently referred to as "Turks" by their neighbors and foreign observers, regardless of their specific ethnic origins like Bosniaks, Albanians, or Lazs [01:10:33]. The people defined by the Ottoman state, constituting its infrastructure, continued their journey under a new name and political ideas [01:14:16].

## Major Sociological Transformations of the Republic

While much continued, there were some significant changes that accompanied the Republic:

### 1. Shift from Sovereign Nation to Single Nation
Perhaps the most profound change was the radical transformation of the society's structure [01:15:53], representing a major [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | political and social implication of ethnic shifts in Turkey]]. In the Ottoman Empire, the Muslim or Turkish segment was considered the "Sovereign Nation," holding a superior position among various coexisting nations [01:16:02]. This structure began to be liquidated in the late Abdulhamid period [01:16:36]. The process of removing non-Muslims from the Turkish Anatolian and Rumelian population started in the 19th century, intensified in the early 20th century just before the Republic, and continued throughout the Republican period until the 1980s [01:17:07]. As a result, the former "Sovereign Society" either became or aimed to become a single nation during the Republic [01:17:34]. This was a deep, radical, and historical transformation in the structure of Ottoman society and state [01:17:44].

### 2. Expansion of Bureaucratic Cadres
The modern state, a global trend since the 19th century, led to an increase in the number and quality of duties undertaken by the state, requiring a growing and diversifying bureaucratic staff [01:20:43]. This resulted in a tremendous increase in the number of literate people capable of administrative work [01:21:44]. While this was a global phenomenon, not specific to Turkey or republics [01:21:48], it significantly impacted Turkey following a period of stagnation and wars [01:22:28]. The administrative cadre expanded from approximately 10,000 to 100,000, leading to a quantitative increase in education, though with a decrease in quality [01:23:09]. These newly educated individuals from across Anatolia and Rumelia became loyal and enthusiastic supporters of the Republican regime, viewing it as their savior [01:24:33].

### 3. Revolutionary Excitement and Idealism
In the 1920s and 30s, Turkey, particularly its administrative cadres, experienced a great revolutionary excitement [01:27:49]. This stemmed from the collapse of the old regime, its defeat in war, and the subsequent "rebuilding" of the state, fostering a feeling of starting a clean page [01:28:14]. This sentiment was also prevalent globally after World War I, with a desire to rebuild societies on rational foundations and abandon old habits [01:28:46].

However, the end result in Turkey was largely disappointment, characterized by "much talk and little action" [01:29:55]. Unlike Russia, which underwent massive transformations under Peter the Great and Stalin, building new cities and civilizations from scratch through tremendous mobilization, Turkey's revolutionary claims did not yield comparable results [01:30:06]. The initial excitement in Turkey, lasting roughly from 1923 to 1950, faded, partly due to the superficial nature of reforms and insufficient administrative cadres [01:33:20]. A significant portion of the Republic's founders acquired wealth through the plunder resulting from the elimination of non-Muslims, and their primary concern became protecting these gains, often masked by nationalistic discourse [01:34:27]. After Mustafa Kemal Pasha's death, many administrators reverted to traditional thinking and management styles [01:35:43]. The speaker suggests that the inadequacy lay not in the sociological infrastructure but in the administrative cadres themselves [01:36:10].

### Change in Head of State Election Method
The main specific and different aspect of the Republic was the change in the method of electing a head of state [01:37:08]. Historically, it was widely accepted that a strong single leader was necessary to govern a large state, and hereditary succession was seen as the most stable method [01:37:16]. However, this model collapsed globally at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly after World War I, with monarchies in Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and China being overthrown or replaced by republics [01:38:51]. This shift was a "fashion of the age" [01:39:49] or a necessity brought by new social structures and ideological trends [01:40:09]. The principle became that anyone approved by the country's elites and, at least for show, by the public could become the head of state [01:40:14].

However, unlike systems like the American presidency with fixed terms, in Turkey and many other countries, the person who came to power often did not willingly give it up [01:40:56]. The speaker sees no serious real-world results from this change in management technique [01:41:48]. Countries that maintained monarchies, like Iran or Jordan, showed similar development processes, including increases in literacy rates, population, and economic growth, comparable to republican regimes [01:42:31]. Therefore, the change in the method of electing the head of state did not produce a significant difference in the sociological field [01:44:12].

In summary, improvements in child mortality, life expectancy, population growth, public health, literacy rates, and access to mass media are global trends not specific to republics or monarchies [01:45:10]. These are developments of the 20th century driven by a new understanding of the state, its expanded influence, extraordinary advancements in transportation and communication, and an astronomical increase in the need for educated personnel and new educational institutions [01:47:16].

The establishment of the Republic was an important historical event, marking a new page in the [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | historical and social overview of Turkey and its evolution]] [01:48:42]. However, the most significant changes between the pre- and post-1923 periods were the shift of Turks from being a "Sovereign Nation" to a single nation [01:48:48] and the expansion of educated public cadres [01:49:03]. The speaker believes these changes would have occurred regardless of whether a republican regime was established [01:49:14]. The "revolutionary excitement" of the 1920s and 30s was real but affected a narrow segment, which ultimately failed in its mission [01:49:24].

## Broader [[Political Dynamics and Social Issues in Turkey | Political Dynamics and Social Issues in Turkey]] in the 1990s

The 1990s in Turkey were a period of mixed feelings. Starting from the mid-1980s, an "Özal movement" aligned with global trends of liberalism (though arguably not true liberalism) encouraged a focus on making money, having fun, and less attention to traditional values [01:21:40]. The world was seen as integrating, with easier international travel and a focus on new trends [01:22:29]. This created an optimistic outlook, especially among the middle and upper classes, with the feeling that Turkey would integrate with the West and join the European Union [01:22:52]. There was an expectation that the dark ideological obsessions of the 1970s would be overcome and that freedom of the press and expression would expand [01:23:43].

However, this optimism slowly gave way to pessimism in the mid-90s [01:24:44]. The Kurdish issue escalated significantly from 1993, with a terror campaign and a policy of deportation in Eastern provinces, leading to the destruction of villages and forced migration [01:25:06]. Dozens of Kurdish writers, thinkers, and businessmen were killed [01:25:28]. This period saw the re-emergence of terror and oppression, with the military re-entering [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | social dynamics and politics in Turkey]] with its tyranny [01:25:41]. This dark period deepened throughout the 1990s, ultimately leading to the explosion of the existing political party system and the rise of the Justice and Development Party around 2000 [01:26:13]. The 1990s are summarized as "not a good period" [01:26:44].

## Historical Inquiries and Official Narratives

The public's interest in niche historical areas, like migrations in the 19th century, stems from a feeling that standard discourses about Turkey's past and identity are based on "stupid lies" [01:28:20]. People perceive a gap between what they learned in school and what they heard from their ancestors [01:28:38]. There is a desire to reconcile these contradictions, especially as resources for independent research are limited [01:28:51].

The official ideology often imposes a singular, national identity, but the true [[political and social issues in Turkey | political and social issues in Turkey]] and [[cultural and political transformations in Turkey and its periphery | cultural and political transformations in Turkey and its periphery]] reveal complex ethnic and cultural divisions across regions and micro-regions [01:29:50]. These include divisions between Arabs and Kurds, Laz and Georgians, old Greeks and later Circassians, Yörüks and Turkmens, and Alevis and Sunnis [01:30:11]. These divisions, clashes, and envies constitute the real, lived history of the country, yet the entire education curriculum and official national ideology are based on denying them and forcing them into a "stupid narrative, a myth" [01:31:06]. Discovering and revealing these local truths, even at a tiny level, is seen as a revolutionary service that shakes the official narrative [01:31:24].

## Freedom of Expression in Turkey

Regarding freedom of expression in Turkey, beyond openly insulting the president, there are significant restrictions [01:17:39]. Expression concerning religion is "absurdly" narrow, banal, and bigoted, making it easy to get into trouble [01:17:51]. Additionally, there is very strong political control in the media [01:18:16]. While media control exists in the West, in Turkey, the standards of decency and legal standards are lower, severely limiting any words that might displease the administration or powerful figures [01:18:26]. The issue is not limited to insulting the president [01:18:51].

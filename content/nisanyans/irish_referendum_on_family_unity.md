On March 8, 2024, a referendum was held in Ireland on proposed changes to the country's constitution regarding the definition of family and the role of women in the home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The referendum was described as a "symbolic and showy issue" with an "ideological war" at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.

## Background

Historically, Ireland was considered Europe's most conservative country until about 10-15 years prior to the referendum, largely due to the influence of the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

## Referendum Proposals

The referendum presented two main changes to the constitution:
1.  **Definition of Family:** An existing article that protected "the family and the family unity" and stated that "the interests of the family come before the state" was proposed for removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. The argument for removal was that "the family is an old and outdated concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. In its place, a broader concept like "permanent togetherness" or "protecting people of the opposite sex or the same sex who live together without getting married" was suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.
2.  **Women's Role:** An article stemming from Ireland's past, which stated that women should not be forced to work or work outside the home, was also proposed for removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a>.

## Unexpected Outcome

Despite widespread support for the "Yes" vote from political and media establishments, the referendum results were overwhelmingly "No" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

*   **Political Consensus:** Both of Ireland's major parties, which form a strong two-party system since the 1920s, strongly advocated for a "Yes" vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. A third coalition party also supported "Yes," meaning "80% or so of the MPs were in favor of a Yes vote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.
*   **Media and NGOs:** An "incredible NGO thing network" and "almost all of the public opinion organizations funded by free funds" were in favor of the constitutional amendment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. The entire Irish press, media organizations, and columnists also supported "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>.
*   **Polls:** Public opinion polls conducted up to a week before the referendum indicated a "Yes" vote would pass, with some showing support between 54% and 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:43">[01:36:43]</a>.
*   **Result:** Contrary to all expectations, the "No" vote received 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

## Analysis

This outcome is considered "a very striking event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>, unlike anything seen in "democratic countries" in the last 30-50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. It represents a radical rejection of "all political actors at once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>.

Comparing it to other significant referendums:
*   **EU Referendums (Netherlands, France):** While expectations were not met, the results were not a "shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>.
*   **Brexit:** The British public and political class were divided, leading to a close result with a 2-point difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>.

In contrast, the Irish referendum saw unanimous support from all major parties, media, and polls for "Yes," yet resulted in a "rout like a defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. The fact that the Prime Minister did not resign after such a result is seen as a "clear indication" of the "complete and complete... bankruptcy" of the "democratic structure and the assumption of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. This highlights a lack of "foresight and morality" among politicians in what is called the "civilized western world," leading to a point where "the idea of democracy has been thrown in the trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>. The question then becomes how a "fair, reasonable and sustainable governance system" will be established in the new age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>.

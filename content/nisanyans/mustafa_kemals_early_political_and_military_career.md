If one had the chance to speak with Mustafa Kemal, the immediate impression might be one of overwhelming power, arrogance, and charisma, making it difficult to engage in a substantive conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, in a different setting, such as a prolonged shared experience, several critical questions about his early political and military career would arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Unexplained Absence and Allegations During World War I

A primary area of inquiry concerns the period after [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Mustafa Kemal]] returned from Damascus and his activities during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

During World War I, while on duty on the Syrian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, [[allegations_against_mustafa_kemal_during_world_war_i | Mustafa Kemal]] was reportedly involved in "dark events" linked to Cemal Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His name was associated with a coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> and he was accused of corruption, specifically selling army horses and pocketing the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Following these [[allegations_against_mustafa_kemal_during_world_war_i | allegations]], he was pardoned from his duties and was unaccounted for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This absence is particularly puzzling given that the Ottoman Empire was engaged in its "greatest war," and [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Mustafa Kemal]] was considered one of its most talented and successful commanders, holding the rank of colonel or brigadier general at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Despite this, he held no duty during some of the war's most intense periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. After approximately six months, he was assigned a "very sensitive" and "serious political task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The nature of his activities during this period and how he returned to such a significant role remain subjects of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Appointment as Vahdettin's Political Caretaker

Another significant question pertains to the internal story of [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Mustafa Kemal]]'s appointment as [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]]'s political caretaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In December 1917, [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] became the new crown prince, with Sultan Re≈üad expected to die soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] was sent on an extended visit to Germany, a protector and ally of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Mustafa Kemal]] was assigned to accompany him as his political caretaker, a role deemed "very sensitive" and "vital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

This assignment is intriguing because [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]], over 60 years old at the time, had never been involved in politics and was described as a "shy, cowardly old gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The decision to send him, accompanied by [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Mustafa Kemal]], to meet powerful figures like the German Emperor during a "life-or-death war" is a notable historical event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The Vienna Trip and the Published Diary

A third area of concern is [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Mustafa Kemal]]'s trip to Vienna in May and June of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. During a particularly dire period of the war, he was sent on a prolonged holiday and for treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Before reaching Vienna, he spent three weeks in a hostel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Intriguingly, a diary from this period was published, containing seemingly mundane entries about daily activities, such as morning walks and a barking dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The publication of such a diary, depicting a prominent commander holding sensitive posts taking a two-month holiday to Austria during wartime, raises questions about the true purpose and nature of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## The Double Game in Anatolia

Finally, a crucial question involves [[mustafa_kemals_strategic_decisions_in_samsun_amasya_and_erzurum | Mustafa Kemal]]'s actions after going to Samsun, specifically the [[mustafa_kemals_strategic_decisions_in_samsun_amasya_and_erzurum | "double game"]] he allegedly played up to Amasya and even Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

[[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] and Damat Ferit Pasha dispatched [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Mustafa Kemal]] to Anatolia with "incredible authority" and a significant mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, he swiftly turned against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The circumstances and motivations behind this sudden reversal of loyalty are a significant historical puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Powerful individuals and leaders often construct their own narratives, rarely providing straightforward answers to such queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Their strong will and ability to shape their life's story mean they do not leave it to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. An intelligent person, such as [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Mustafa Kemal]], would likely not allow anyone to easily challenge this self-crafted narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Defining Religion Beyond Belief

Traditional views often equate religion with a set of beliefs, such as those concerning Allah, angels, books, and prophets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. However, this perception of religion as primarily a matter of belief is a superficial understanding, akin to "icing on the cake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This specific idea of religion emerged in the Western world in the 19th century and gained traction in TÃ¼rkiye during the latter half of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Historically, people understood the concept of religion without necessarily holding strong personal beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, and surprisingly, even some religious officials have admitted to losing their faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

The Arabic word "listen" (from Hebrew), meaning judgment, court, or city ("Medina"), also implies "state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Similarly, the ancient Greek word "polis" refers to a human community organized within a framework of laws and rules, from which the word "civilization" is derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The Latin word "law" signifies being bound by a legal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. These linguistic roots suggest that religion, at its core, is an authority system designed to regulate social life and delineate acceptable and unacceptable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## Historical Functions of Religion

For approximately 99% of humanity's written history, religion has served as the fundamental organizational principle for societies, permeating every aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. It functions as an authority system that establishes the basic rules of civil life, determines what is valid and invalid, and dictates whose voice carries weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Ultimately, religion plays a role in balancing power within a society, defining who is considered weak and who is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

Key functions of religion throughout history include:

*   **Domesticating and Educating**: Religion serves as a system for instilling specific value judgments, myths, and stories into children from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. Historically, religious educational institutions were the primary places where children first received formal learning, studying sacred texts and learning to respect symbols and moral precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Regulating Life's Rhythm**: Religion dictates the daily, weekly, and annual routines of individuals, including prayers, attendance at places of worship, and celebration of holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
*   **Managing Biological Milestones**: Religion formalizes and ritualizes significant biological events in human life, such as birth, marriage, and death, transforming them into social ceremonies embedded within a broader narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. These ceremonies impose societal approval and consequences, especially regarding sexual intercourse, ensuring that such activities are managed within a defined framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

While belief in God, angels, and prophets can facilitate the functioning of this system and encourage internalization without much questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, it is not mandatory for the religious system to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. As long as rituals, narratives, and religious education are maintained, the system can continue irrespective of individual belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Even in deeply religious historical periods, such as traditional Indian religions, not believing in gods was considered a valid religious sect or attitude, provided the community maintained its religious structures, gurus, and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

## Evolution of Religion and Freedom

From the 18th century onward, particularly in the Western world, the authority of the religious system began to decline significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Reducing religion solely to private beliefs leads to its destruction, making it unsustainable, as these beliefs can be difficult to defend through rational analysis outside of a social context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

The concept of "freedom" itself is always "freedom from something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>, and its evolution is closely tied to the shifting role of religion. The demand for freedom often arises from a desire to reduce or eliminate existing societal restrictions imposed by various authorities, laws, customs, or beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

Initially, in the 17th century (England, Netherlands, Germany), the concept of "liberty" primarily revolved around religious freedom for specific communities, seeking autonomy from state religious authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This was not yet about individual freedom from religious authority, as the idea of an individual existing independently of religion was not widely conceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. These groups simply desired their own community laws and traditions, distinct from the official state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

By the early 19th century, particularly after the French Revolution, a new idea emerged: educated elites and intellectuals might not be obliged to submit to religious authority and could live without religious customs or beliefs if they chose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. This demand for secular freedom was initially exclusive to intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. The broader idea that *everyone* should be free from religion only gained traction in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. This shift, liberating competent individuals from religious authority, represents a monumental revolution and defines the modern age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

The perception of religion has evolved from being the central organizing principle of society, encompassing education, daily life, and major human milestones, to a more private matter of belief. This transformation is deeply intertwined with the historical development of the concept of freedom, which has progressively sought liberation from various forms of authority, including religious, aristocratic, and bureaucratic controls.

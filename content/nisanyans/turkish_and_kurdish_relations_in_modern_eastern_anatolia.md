This article is based on insights from a travel book titled *Turkey East of Ankara: A Trip for Eastern Turkey is Rejected*, published in 2006, which explores the [[historical_ethnic_structure_of_eastern_anatolia | oldest settlement structure of Eastern Anatolia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The book, written over six years, aimed to discuss sensitive topics in Eastern Turkey without causing excessive disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. It is bilingual, with separate Turkish and English sections that employ different approaches to cater to distinct audiences and their prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. The research for the book involved extensive travel across the region, including villages in Ardahan, districts and villages of Hakkari, governorships, and areas like Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and northern Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. The author engaged with various individuals, from villagers to cultured residents, gendarmerie commanders, and police station commanders, to understand the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

## Historical Demographics of Eastern Anatolian Cities

Prior to the early 20th century, major cities in Eastern Anatolia, such as Van and Diyarbakır, were primarily populated by Turkish-speaking inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>. In the 1910s, there was no trace of Kurds in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. Similarly, in Diyarbakır's center, Turkish was spoken, and most major families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:36">[03:36:36]</a>. This pattern was common across the Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>.

### The Ottoman Ruling Class and Turkification
The Ottoman ruling class was cosmopolitan, comprising individuals of various origins like Albanian, Dagestani, and Georgian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:33">[04:33:33]</a>. When individuals from diverse backgrounds migrated to cities and achieved a higher social class, education, or a position within the state mechanism, they automatically became "Turks" and began speaking Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. Therefore, the origins of many families in Diyarbakır's center, even if their ancestors were Circassian, were considered Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:23">[04:23:23]</a>. A person recognized as a Turk was one whose origin could be from anywhere in the empire, but who integrated into Turkish society and spoke Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:49">[04:49:49]</a>.

### Role of Non-Muslims in Urban Centers
Non-Muslim communities, particularly Armenians, played a crucial role in providing urban services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:19">[05:19:19]</a>. In the early 20th century, about half of Van's population was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:21">[05:21:21]</a>. In Diyarbakır, over half the population was governed by Turks, with Armenians constituting 20-30% and Assyrians also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:30">[05:30:30]</a>. Mardin's ruling class was predominantly Christian and Arabic-speaking, although the ruling families considered themselves Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44">[05:44:44]</a>. There was significant intermingling, with many Turkish families having Armenian ancestry, indicating a deeply intertwined [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | relationship between Turks and Armenians]] in the urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>.

### Impact of Armenian Population Elimination
The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had unforeseen negative consequences for the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became uninhabitable, lacking essential services such as dentists, tailors, or insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:52">[06:52:52]</a>. The group that provided the cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure to these cities disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>.

## Republican Era Changes and Urban Decay
During the Republic period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities dwindled as they sent their children to study in Ankara and Istanbul, with many never returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>. This led to a gradual collapse and decay of these cities until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:50">[07:50:50]</a>.

## The "Kurdishization" of Eastern Anatolia
Starting in the 1960s, as the economy developed, there was a significant migration from villages to cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:05">[08:05:05]</a>. This resulted in the gradual "Kurdishization" of all cities in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:14">[08:14:14]</a>. For example, when the author first visited Mardin in the 1970s and 80s, there was no trace of Kurds in the city center, which was largely Arab and Arabic-speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:21">[08:21:21]</a>. However, resistance to Kurdish migration into Mardin led to the massive growth of Kızıltepe, a nearby Kurdish city, which became larger than Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Eventually, this "wall" collapsed, and Kurds are now the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:23">[09:23:23]</a>.

### Current Demographics of Key Cities
Currently, Diyarbakır is almost entirely Kurdish, with 80-90% of its population being Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:34">[09:34:34]</a>. Van also has a significant Kurdish majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:41">[09:41:41]</a>. According to the author, the greatest success of the Republican regime in Eastern Turkey has been the complete "Kurdishization" of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:53">[09:53:53]</a>. While Kurds were a numerous element before, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:12">[10:12:12]</a>. Today, the region is almost homogeneously Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:26">[10:26:26]</a>.

## Implications of Kurdish Homogeneity
This demographic shift has created social demands that are deemed impossible to prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:39">[10:39:39]</a>. Although Turkish is currently the official language, it is argued that Kurdish must be recognized, taught in schools, spoken on the streets, and become a dominant language in government and broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:48">[10:48:48]</a>. With a population of nearly 20 million, predominantly Kurdish speakers who speak their language with pride, it is asserted that their language cannot be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:12">[11:12:12]</a>. This means everyone living in the region, including Turks, will eventually need to learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:40">[11:40:40]</a>. Delaying this recognition is believed to lead to increasing trouble and an eventual "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:56">[11:56:56]</a>. A homogeneous population of 20 million, with 87-90% dominance in their own region, possessing their own language and a class of organic intellectuals, cannot be dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:07">[12:07:07]</a>. Arresting leaders or resorting to violence is deemed a futile and unsustainable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:42">[12:42:42]</a>.

## International Perspectives on a Potential Kurdistan
The establishment of an independent Kurdish state in the region faces significant challenges, particularly due to the current international conjuncture and the vast military power disparity with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. International powers like the United States are unlikely to abandon or seek to disintegrate a vital partner like Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:55">[13:55:55]</a>.

However, certain states could benefit from Turkey's control weakening in the region and the long-term loss of its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:36">[14:36:36]</a>. These include Arab states and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:40">[14:40:40]</a>. Russia, viewing Turkey as a potential long-term threat alongside Germany, would benefit from the division and rupture of Turkey, especially if the part closer to Russia becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:53">[14:53:53]</a>. States that would benefit from the creation of "Kurdistans" in the region include Russia, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, but not the United States or Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:02">[16:02:02]</a>.

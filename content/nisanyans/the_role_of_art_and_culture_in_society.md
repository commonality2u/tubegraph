From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Culture and science are described as "very important things" that hold a society together and give it direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Throughout history, high arts and fine arts—including literature, music, and architecture—have served a basic function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This function, observed in Islamic, Christian, Chinese, and Indian societies, has always been to answer the question, "Who are we, and why are we so good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Art is a tool for society to understand itself and idealize itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Western Cultural Collapse

The speaker observes a "total collapse of culture and civilization" in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This process, which began in the first quarter of the 20th century, has reached a "terrifying level" of social dysfunction in the last 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Societies seem to have forgotten their reason for existence, with millions of people having "completely forgotten" questions like "how can we live better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

This decline is particularly noticeable to those who take Western culture and civilization seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The Western world experienced a significant rupture in World War I, suffering a terrible moral collapse and losing faith in itself and its institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### [[art_and_cultural_transformations_in_the_20th_century | Modernist Art Movements]]

Following World War I, modernist movements emerged, aiming to break societal authority structures and mock or belittle existing values in painting, literature, music, and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. While this was perhaps a "necessary correction" due to societal arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, the speaker notes that this process did not result in a re-questioning of higher values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Europe's 500-year strong art tradition allowed it to produce what could still be called art for another 20-30 years after 1918, citing figures like Picasso, Stravinsky, and Le Corbusier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. However, after 1945, things "got completely out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Modern art became an investment area for wealthy individuals harboring a "sense of hatred towards culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Artists like Jackson Pollock, who "claimed to paint by throwing a bucket of paint at the wall," began presenting buffoonery as economically sound art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This phenomenon spread like a cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, contributing to a state of "social decay" in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Russia's Cultural Path

Russia, particularly during the Soviet Union period, seemed to enter a "time tunnel" for 70-80 years, halting cultural progress and largely living with its memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. It attempted to combine classical art understanding with a political program, which was not very productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. However, at the end of this stagnation, Russia did not experience the same moral collapse as the Western world in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

The speaker suggests Russia is undergoing an "awakening," picking up where it left off in 1917, like a "Sleeping Beauty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. There is a possibility that a country that avoided the 20th-century cultural desert could produce a new modernism rooted in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

### Ilya Glazunov Museum Experience
An unplanned visit to the Ilya Glazunov Museum in Moscow offered a contrasting perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Ilya Glazunov was a prominent Russian painter from the 1970s to the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He was a classical Soviet artist who got along well with the regime, becoming president of the Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. After the Soviet collapse, his work became increasingly political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Glazunov is described as a "first-class" classical painter whose work clearly understood that art has a "social function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This encounter led to the observation that art's historical function is to help society understand and idealize itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## The Impact of Technological Advances on Culture

### Printing Press and its Ambivalent Effects
The invention of the printing press in Europe led to simultaneously positive and negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>:
*   **Increased Readership:** Books, once expensive luxury items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>, became widely accessible.
*   **Religious Fanaticism:** The widespread availability of Bibles contributed to an "incredible explosion in religious fanaticism" across Europe, leading to 20-30 years of religious wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.
*   **Sensationalism:** There was a "great explosion" in the sales of sensational and hatred-inducing books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. For example, *Malus Maleficarum*, printed in 1480, provided information on detecting witches and contributed to the "strange madness" of witch burnings, which was a New Age phenomenon resulting from the printing press, not a medieval tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.

Historians and thinkers hold an ambivalent view on whether the printing press was a good or bad development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

### Internet and Modern Cultural Dynamics
Similar dynamics are observed with the spread of the internet today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. The internet is an "unstoppable event" establishing a "New World" with its own good and bad aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. Like the printing press, it marks a turning point and the beginning of a new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.

### Automobile's Impact on Urban Culture and [[cultural_and_societal_norms | Societal Norms]]
The automobile is seen as having "destroyed cities" and introduced a new line of urbanization unprecedented in world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   Before 1910, the primary unit of a city was housing and neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.
*   After 1910, new city developments centered around roads for cars, shaping urban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>.
*   While older cities (pre-1910) worldwide were unique and "suitable for human sensitivities," modern cities often lack this quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>. The speaker suggests that 997 out of 1000 modern cities are "terrible places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The automobile is the "real turning point" in this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a>.

The administration panel for Zoom underwent a change, causing the speaker to have difficulty understanding its new layout and functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It took approximately four minutes to try and figure out the new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Impact on Broadcast

Due to the changes, the initial link sent to program participants was likely incorrect and would not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The speaker had to generate and send a new link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Later in the broadcast, further [[technical_difficulties_with_computer_during_live_broadcast | technical difficulties]] were noted when attempting to invite a guest, Eren, indicating ongoing issues with navigating the new Zoom interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. It was revealed that the previously sent link for the preliminary meeting was incorrect and did not connect to the YouTube broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

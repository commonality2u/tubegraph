The [[historical_events_of_april_24_1915 | 1915 incident]] is described as the "golden shot" and the final blow in a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse targeting Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Role of the Union and Progress Administration
The events of [[historical_events_of_april_24_1915 | 1915]] were explicitly "a program taken and carried out by the [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Union and Progress]] administration of the Turkish state and the Ottoman state bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This was not a spontaneous event but a "conscious and cold-blooded decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, characterized as an "annihilation project" rather than a pogrom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The administration's objective was to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem that had been a problem for the Ottomans for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. To achieve this, a "serious organization with the help of the state" was put in place to "clean it up completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Utilization of Kurdish Elements
The [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Union and Progress]] administration leveraged existing regional dynamics:
*   **Allies and Subcontractors** The state used "Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish people as allies and as helpers and subcontractors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Existing Tradition** This was facilitated by an "existing tradition of massacre and extortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> among some Kurdish elements.
*   **State Backing** The Turkish state "successfully" utilized this in the Eastern provinces, effectively telling perpetrators, "you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you. Don't worry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This official assurance meant that individuals would not be judged for their crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Historically, Armenians often preferred the Ottoman State as their protectors against Kurdish attacks, frequently seeking refuge with Ottoman governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, in [[historical_events_of_april_24_1915 | 1915]], this dynamic shifted as the state itself became the orchestrator of the annihilation project.

It is noted that after the Armenian high school was abolished around 1880, and the opportunities for looting property, and taking women ceased, some Kurds realized the consequences of their actions and the potential threat from the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In recent decades, there has been a radical shift in the attitude and approach of Kurds towards the Armenian issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

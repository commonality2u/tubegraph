The Treaty of Sevres, signed in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, played a significant, albeit complex and ultimately unfulfilled, role in the [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions|relations between Greece and Turkey]] during the [[historical_context_of_the_greco_turkish_war_1919_1922|post-World War I period]]. It emerged amidst the broader context of the [[historical_conflicts_and_events_in_the_ottoman_empire_and_greece|Ottoman Empire's collapse]] and the [[turkish_and_greek_historical_relations|Greco-Turkish War]].

## Initial Context and Greek Hopes

In the period known as the War of Independence (1919-1922) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, Greece was promised only the province of Izmir and the district of Ayvalık on the international platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. At the Paris Peace Conference, it was decided that Greece, as an Allied country, would land troops in Izmir and Ayvalık to maintain public order in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This was initially viewed as a police operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> and intended to provide a safe haven for Greek refugees deported from the Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

While there were hopes among some in Greece for greater territorial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, sensible echelons with administrative responsibility did not entertain such widespread ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. The major powers, including Britain, France, Italy, and America, did not suggest extensive Greek annexation of Turkish lands at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Izmir and Ayvalık were meant to be within Greece's security area until a peace treaty was finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## The Treaty of Sevres' Provisions

The Treaty of Sevres itself was described as a "very strange text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It envisaged a five-year occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, followed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This provision effectively meant that Izmir and Ayvalık would be given to the Greeks after a five-year transition period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

However, the treaty was largely "stillborn" as no one signed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. It functioned more as a "bargaining document" or a "threatening document" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## The Greek Military Campaign Beyond Sevres

The broader Greek military operation in Western Anatolia in 1920 and 1921, which saw the Greek Army advance beyond Izmir province to places like Nazilli, Bursa, Aydın, and reaching the Sakarya River, was different from the Sevres' territorial provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The aim of this extensive campaign was not the annexation of these regions to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Instead, it was a "punitive operation" intended to compel the Ankara government to surrender, accept the Treaty of Sevres, or agree to its amended and renegotiated versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The goal was to eliminate or intimidate the Ankara government and deal directly with Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory

Had the Greek offensive succeeded in defeating the Ankara government at Sakarya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, it would have led to a reformulation of the Treaty of Sevres at a conference, such as a London Conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. A victorious Greece would have secured Izmir and Ayvalık or the Aegean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Additionally, a consortium or collective management, possibly involving Greeks, would have been formed in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

Such a Greek victory would have had profound implications for [[Role of major powers in the Greco Turkish conflict|major power relations]]:
*   It would have given Britain a dominant position in the diplomatic field regarding Turkey, exacerbating the widening rift between France and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Italy would have aligned with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   However, even a defeated Turkey, with its large population and highly developed administrative and military classes, would not have remained silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. It would have engaged in a struggle through economic, social, political, and organizational means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   A "new Turkey" under British rule, using Greece against Turkey, would have likely joined the "avengers camp" in a future conflict, seeking revenge for its treatment in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. There is little doubt that such a Turkey would have allied with Germany during the 1938-1939 period, potentially altering the entire history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Military and Economic Realities

Despite the initial Greek advances, the possibility of a long-term Greek victory over Turkey was considered unlikely by many, including the British and French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. [[Comparative military and economic strengths of Greece and Turkey in 1922|Turkey's population was four or five times larger than Greece's, and its economy was at least three times as large]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. While the armies were roughly equal in numbers in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, a long-term war would inevitably favor the larger power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Greece had no chance of winning a war against Turkey that lasted longer than one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the Aegean Region's population was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. The only chance for the Greek army was swift victory with strong and continuous British military and financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Once the conflict stalemated and turned into a frontal war after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece's chances became negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

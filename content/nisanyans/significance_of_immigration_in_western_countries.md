In recent times, [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration trends in the United States and Europe]] have reached unprecedented levels, described as an "incredible invasion movement" across the Western world [0:34:14].

## Current Trends and Statistics

### United States
In the United States, in a single month, approximately 260,000 illegal immigrants entered, with the total number, including unregistered individuals, estimated at 500,000 [0:34:37]. This trend shows an increase each month over the past year [0:34:52]. It is projected that by the end of 2023, around 2 million people will have entered the United States from the Mexican border alone, an event of "historic proportions" [0:35:05].

### Europe
Similar phenomena are observed in Europe, particularly with people migrating across the Mediterranean to Italy and then onwards to other European countries via boats [0:35:15]. This scale of migration is seen as potentially "destroying social fabrics" [0:35:30].

## Reasons for Encouraging Immigration

There are two primary theories regarding why Western governments might practically encourage illegal [[immigration_and_societal_challenges_in_western_countries | immigration]]:

### 1. Government Incompetence and Irresponsibility
One possibility suggests that the leadership cadres in Western countries are of "unparalleled quality and inadequate" [0:36:30]. Examples cited include leaders like Justin Trudeau and Annalena Baerbock, with a general observation that recent prime ministers in England would not be hired to manage a proper company [0:36:49]. This perspective attributes the open borders to complete "stupidity and incompetence and irresponsibility" [0:36:14].

### 2. Need for Cheap Labor (More Plausible Explanation)
A more "weighty explanation" is the conscious policy to encourage [[immigration_and_societal_challenges_in_western_countries | immigration]] due to a demand for cheap labor [0:37:45].

*   **High Cost of Domestic Labor**: It is deemed impossible to employ citizens of Western countries because they are "very expensive" [0:38:08]. For instance, a French citizen demands wages that many businesses cannot afford, or they will not work [0:38:14].
*   **Social Rights and Employment Challenges**: The extensive social rights, human rights, women's rights, and other rights enjoyed by citizens make their employment problematic for employers [0:38:34].
*   **Demographic Collapse**: There is a significant decrease in the number of white Europeans and Americans, leading to an incredibly increasing average age and a shortage of people to employ [0:38:56].
*   **Lessons from China Strategy**: Previously, this problem was addressed by outsourcing industry to China for cheap labor [0:39:16]. However, this policy proved "crazy and wrong" as it eliminated the industrial infrastructure of North America and England [0:39:43].

The current approach involves importing a large population willing to work cheaply and without protest [0:40:01]. By allowing people to enter illegally, governments can ensure cheap labor and retain the power to deport individuals without question in case of "any social unrest" or "the slightest mistake" [0:40:33]. This mechanism is described as a "fairly modern... slavery system" [0:41:15], drawing parallels to the historical importation of millions of African slaves to the American continent in earlier centuries [0:41:24].

## Historical Parallels of Population Movements

This phenomenon of massive population movements is not new. The Ottoman Empire, for instance, experienced an analogous process between the 19th and early 20th centuries, where the Muslim ruling class faced the "possibility of collapse and annihilation" [0:04:36]. This period saw the rise of Unionism, an ideology focused on maintaining the existence of the Muslim ruling class [0:08:41] and modernizing while eliminating non-Muslim elements from the country [0:08:46].

In a similar vein, the Russian Empire, particularly after the 1917 revolution, experienced an "incredible brain drain" to European countries [0:31:07]. Writers, scientists, businessmen, and artists migrated, forming a significant part of European modernism in the 1920s and 30s [0:31:07]. This contrasts with Ottoman immigrants of the same period, who generally did not achieve significant social success abroad [0:31:07]. The key difference was that while Russia's new regime declared the existing elite as enemies and seized their assets, Türkiye's new regime after the Ottoman Empire's collapse promised a good future for its educated cadres, leading many to return or not leave in the first place [0:31:07].# Significance of Immigration in Western Countries

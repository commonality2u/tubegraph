From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The discussion frequently touches upon the evolution and perceived decline of [[western_and_eastern_concepts_of_freedom_and_modernity | Western concepts of freedom and modernity]] and their impact on [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics and conflicts]].

## The Erosion of Western Reference Systems
For a long time, political and social analysis relied on specific reference systems for evaluating reality [00:32:27]. Historically, two interconnected references were prominent from a Western perspective:
*   **Western Liberalism** This combines the ideals of the French Revolution, the American Constitution, British parliamentarism, and the German ideal of the rule of law [00:33:05].
*   **Western Socialism** [00:33:53]
These two systems provided a basis for evaluating and criticizing societal developments in Europe [00:33:57].

However, the speaker notes a significant shift:
*   Socialism, as a reference, went bankrupt in 1991 [00:36:17].
*   [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western liberalism]] lost its credibility and reference value by the 2010s [00:36:29].

This collapse is attributed to several factors:
*   The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that the powers and states dominating the West have become a "Great Danger for humanity," with their existence based on lies and a disregard for truth [00:37:33]. This realization, akin to a "stone dropping in the cup," marked a bankruptcy point [00:37:25].
*   The speaker observes that the "democratic parliamentary system" presented by the West is merely a "buffoonery," lacking connection between its idealized narrative and real-world functioning [00:39:12]. This loss of moral and cultural anchors has left a void, making it difficult to evaluate other social structures, such as those of China or Russia, without a political or philosophical stance [00:39:44].

## Perspectives on Global Powers
The discussion offers [[political_commentary_on_current_global_affairs | political commentary on current global affairs]] and various perspectives on leading global entities:

### China
China is presented as an "extraordinary social experiment" [01:00:47], appearing to have created an organization where individuals contribute their best for national development with a strong sense of social sacrifice [00:40:57].
*   The speaker has not visited China and cannot judge its impact on individual freedoms or tyranny [00:41:28].
*   China, within its own culture and traditions, has historically not sought to dominate outside its borders, nor is there an indication it is doing so today [00:42:16].

### Russia
Previously, the speaker would have critically assessed Russia's social order [00:32:05]. However, with the perceived collapse of Western reference points, such criticism becomes challenging to ground [00:39:44].

### Argentina and the BRICS Alliance
The recent Argentinian election results are viewed with skepticism [01:18:05]. The newly elected president's promises to dismantle the Central Bank or ministries are seen as impossible due to a lack of power and the complexity of international financial relations [01:18:30].
*   His stance on Israel or Ukraine is deemed insignificant, as Argentina lacks the capacity to influence these conflicts [01:19:32].
*   The only significant consequence of the election is Argentina's decision not to join BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) [01:20:00]. This is seen as a move covertly supported by the United States, as the BRICS initiative poses a serious threat to the dollar's dominance, a cornerstone of US global influence [01:20:31]. The BRICS alliance is establishing rival financial institutions and systematically shifting international trade away from the dollar [01:20:56].

## International Mediation and Diplomacy
Being a mediator in peace processes is not a passive role [01:14:51]. It involves:
*   Assuming responsibility [01:15:03].
*   Producing strong alternatives [01:15:10].
*   Threatening parties to ensure compliance [01:15:14].
A recent example is China's mediation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which significantly increased China's global influence [01:15:55]. Similarly, the Beijing-led ceasefire for Gaza, despite opposition from the US, EU, and Israel, demonstrated China's effective diplomacy, likely involving undisclosed "stick and carrot" tactics [01:16:26]. This has also increased the effectiveness of Saudi Arabia, which is increasingly partnering with China [01:17:36].

## [[exploration_of_western_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Exploration of Western and Turkish Political Dynamics]]
The speaker discusses Turkey's historical challenges and political landscape.

### The Legacy of Atatürk and Kemalism
A significant portion of Turkey's 100-year republican experiment is considered a "great fiasco" due to society's failure to confront the reality of Atatürk and his past [01:33:33].
*   The period from 1923 to 1938 was characterized by a "regime of terror," instilling deep fear in people [00:05:20].
*   Despite expectations of freedom after Atatürk's death in 1938, people "lost their honor" and were unable to overcome their fear, leading to a "competition of praise" to silence shame [00:06:06].
*   This psychological damage is considered the basic starting point of the social disease known as Kemalism [00:07:05], a suppression of consciousness and fear pushed into the subconscious [00:07:14].
*   Similar fears existed in the Soviet Union under Stalin and Germany under Hitler [00:07:37]. While Germany (Hitler's defeat) and the Soviet Union (Stalin's burial and self-criticism) eventually confronted their pasts, Turkey's efforts to "bury" Atatürk after his death were ambivalent [00:08:32].
    *   During the İnönü period, there were attempts to make Atatürk forgotten [00:09:49].
    *   However, after 1950, a "Protection Law" was passed, his tomb was built and made a national symbol, and his image was put back on money [01:04:00]. This created a situation where the past was "put in a museum" [01:04:41] and Atatürk was turned into an "internal enemy" and a "halo of holiness," serving as a loyalty test for political advancement [01:12:06].

### The Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations
The idea of an Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations is proposed as a potential long-term plan for Turkey's national existence [01:44:03].
*   This cannot be based on primitive Islamism [01:44:07] or myths [01:44:16].
*   The Ottoman Empire was a continuation of Byzantium, not a simple Islamic state [01:44:38].
*   Attempting regional integration with Islamic ferocity in today's conditions is considered "stupidity and ignorance" [01:45:13].
*   Despite this, Turkey's geographic centrality, organizational capacity, and location on trade routes make it a key country for regional success [01:45:46]. This concept requires detailed design and feasibility studies [01:46:10].

## Historical Questions and Reflections
The discussion delves into various historical scenarios and societal phenomena.

### Armenian Autonomy and the Treaty of Sevres
Regarding hypothetical scenarios involving Armenian privileges before WWI or a Great Armenia after the Treaty of Sevres:
*   A project for an "Ottoman Armenia" with potential capitals like Erzurum or Van was discussed around 1912-1914 [01:48:57].
*   However, another Armenia existed within the Russian Empire, with Tbilisi as its capital [01:49:16]. These two entities would have struggled to unite, akin to the separation of Czech Republic/Slovakia or Macedonia/Bulgaria [01:49:30]. Sibling strife is noted as particularly terrible [01:51:36].
*   After the Treaty of Sevres, the possibility of a Great Armenia was non-existent because no Armenians remained in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire [01:52:12].

### Kurdistan and Turkey's Economy
The idea that Kurdistan hinders Turkey's prosperity due to lower per capita income is dismissed as "completely wrong" [01:53:12].
*   The exploitation of eastern provinces plays a significant role in the growth and strengthening of Turkish capital [01:54:15]. Without these provinces, Turkey would be a smaller country, like Bulgaria or Syria [01:54:28].
*   States inherently seek to grow due to the "power synergies" and organizational capacity that come with increased sovereignty [01:54:47].
*   The notion that invaders didn't want to take the region is also incorrect [01:55:12]. The establishment of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq was clear from the outset [01:55:20].
*   While a Kurdistan was considered, it was not taken seriously by the major powers (England, France, US, Russia) [01:55:36] because:
    *   It would be landlocked [01:55:45].
    *   It would be surrounded by four enemy powers [01:55:51].
    *   There was no historical unity, ruling class, or common political will among the diverse principalities and tribes in the region [01:56:11].
    *   British Major Noel, who enthusiastically advocated for Kurdistan, was dismissed [01:57:48].

## Defining a City's Appeal
A city's attractiveness, especially for younger people, is defined by:
*   **Abundance of ambitious people**: The presence of individuals striving for excellence and championship in their respective fields, expanding the city's intellectual horizon [01:29:41].
*   **Variety of common places**: Numerous and diverse cafes, restaurants, art and culture centers, temples, and conference halls where people can meet and interact [01:32:24].
*   **Quality of institutions**: The presence of high-quality and powerful institutions and companies in various sectors provides career opportunities and a lively professional environment [01:33:40].
The speaker notes that cities lose their appeal for people over a certain age, personally preferring small villages [01:34:17].

## Prophets and Religious Leaders
The historical absence of female prophets or religion founders is questioned. While a few female prophetesses like Miriam (Moses' sister) are mentioned in the Torah [01:35:33], the speaker struggles to provide further concrete examples of female religious leaders [01:36:53].

## War in the Quran
The reasons for war in the Quran are described as aggression, denial of the right to life, and fraud [01:25:06].
*   During his 10-year presidency in Medina, Prophet Muhammad organized 60 jihads, acquiring substantial loot (80% for fighters, 20% as taxes) [01:25:21]. This economic presence made his movement attractive [01:25:51].
*   The strategy involved declaring war on non-compliant tribes, looting them, and offering choices of submission or enslavement [01:26:24]. The acquired wealth fueled further expansion [01:26:57].
*   The verse "There is no compulsion in religion" [01:27:16] is noted to be from the Meccan period when Prophet Muhammad lacked power to enforce submission [01:27:35]. The later Medinan surahs, which form the core of the Quran, are characterized by "severe coercion in religion," threatening those who do not submit [01:27:53]. The message implies that non-compliance leads to being an "enemy of religion" [01:28:30].

## The Roman Triumvirates
The question of why the Second Triumvirate was bloodier than the first leads to a discussion of Roman history:
*   **First Triumvirate (60 BC)**: Comprised of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, it was an attempt to govern the expanding Roman Republic [00:59:50]. This method was a response to the inadequacy of city-state institutions to manage a growing empire that included prosperous regions like Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt [01:00:22]. It quickly failed, with Crassus dying in war and Caesar and Pompey clashing [01:01:58].
*   **Second Triumvirate (30s BC)**: Formed by Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus [01:02:31]. The speaker suggests reading historian Tom Holland's books *Rubicon* and *Dynasty* for detailed accounts of this period [01:03:02].

## The Use of Proverbs
While proverbs can clarify ideas and silence opponents, excessive use can make a speaker appear "old-fashioned" or "senile" [01:05:20]. Proverbs are generally empty talk, as opposing proverbs often exist for every statement [01:05:47].

## Haiti's History
Haiti is an historically important country, though now one of the poorest in the world [01:07:06].
*   The island of Santo Domingo (Hispaniola) was a French and Spanish colonial "concentration camp" for sugar cane production, with hundreds of thousands of African slaves working under brutal conditions [01:07:50].
*   Inspired by the French Revolution, the slaves in the French part of the island revolted around 1791-1792, slaughtering whites and declaring a republic [01:08:47].
*   The revolutionary French regime, despite its ideals of liberty and equality, sent an army to suppress the Haitian revolution, committing massacres, but ultimately failed and granted Haiti independence [01:09:18].
*   After independence, Haiti became a "garbage country," governed by tyrannical native dictators instead of the former ruling class [01:10:35].
*   The Haitian slave rebellion, alongside similar events under British rule, influenced England and the US to reconsider and eventually stop the colonial incident, realizing the immense cost and difficulty of maintaining control [01:11:37]. Colonial powers, initially disgusted by their own adventurous looters, eventually benefited from the money flowing from colonies, leading them to justify their presence with claims of bringing "civilization" [01:12:16]. Money is described as an "acid that melts moral principles and political principles" [01:13:44].

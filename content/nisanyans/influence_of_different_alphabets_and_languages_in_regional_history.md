The evolution and adoption of various alphabets and languages have significantly shaped the cultural and historical landscape of different regions, often reflecting periods of modernization, empire influence, or national revival.

## Language as a Mirror of Modernization: The Case of Turkish

From approximately 1810-1820 until the 1960s, French served as the primary [[role_of_language_in_cultural_dominance | reference language]] for Turks during their adaptation to the modern world [02:51:11]. Concepts needing adoption from the West were typically borrowed from French [02:52:35]. After the 1960s, particularly post-1983, English largely replaced French as the reference language [02:53:38].

The influx of French words into Turkish began around 1810-1850, especially during the Tanzimat period and before the Crimean War [02:26:06]. A significant number of French words, approximately 4800, entered the standard Turkish vocabulary, excluding specialized jargon, out of a total working vocabulary of around 15,000 words [02:28:11].

Early French loanwords in the 18th century were often "labels of a foreign culture," used almost in quotation marks to describe foreign concepts like "general," "archduke," "duchess," or "mademoiselle" [02:27:09]. These words held no intrinsic meaning within Ottoman society [02:27:43].

Around 1810, a new wave of French concepts, adaptable to Ottoman society, began to enter Turkish intensively [02:28:07]:
*   **Cultural innovations:** *Gazeta* (newspaper) [02:28:16], *musician* [02:29:14], *lotarya* (lottery) [02:29:24], *sofa* [02:29:35], *billiards* [02:29:42], *coat* and *tie* (neckwear) [02:29:51], *cigarette* [03:00:09], and *ticket* [03:02:25]. The concept of a "ticket" was new, as traditional Ottoman and Islamic society lacked equivalents for organized public entertainment or public transportation [03:03:10].
*   **Technical and scientific terms:** *Vapur* (steamship) [03:18:18], *şifre* (railway) [03:29:25], *telegraph* [03:35:50], *electricity* (first dated 1811) [03:19:35], *physics* [03:22:07], *thermometer*, and *barometer* [03:21:16].
*   **Commercial products:** New fabrics like *calico* and *flannel* [03:32:58], representing products of the Industrial Revolution [03:33:05].
*   **Institutional and administrative terms:** *Bank* [03:33:42], *parliament* [03:33:54], *commander* [03:44:46], *policy* (referring to interstate diplomacy) [03:55:06], *dictator* [03:52:52], *police* and *gendarmerie* [03:56:59], and *budget* [03:57:11]. These concepts were new to Ottoman society, which previously lacked direct equivalents [03:55:52].

The adoption of "policy" as a respectable profession directly correlated with the Ottoman Empire's desire to join the European community of states from the 1840s onwards [03:16:13]. The **[[historical_context_and_influence_of_western_culture_on_alphabet_reform | historical context and influence of Western culture on alphabet reform]]** on Ottoman language is evident in these borrowings.

Regarding military terminology, the Ottoman military adopted the word "sevkülceyş" (dispatching armies) and "tabiye" (positioning) in the 1880s as part of army modernization and German-led reforms of military education [01:17:18]. These were direct translations of "strategy" and "tactic" [01:17:48]. These terms were used extensively until the 1940s and 50s, only later replaced by the direct French loanwords "strategy" and "tactic" [01:18:06].

### Modern Lexicography and Language Evolution
The concept of "strategy" as a military science emerged during the Napoleonic wars (around 1810), evolving military thought and doctrine [01:23:03]. It refers to the art of guiding armies and war equipment to the battlefield [01:16:18]. The word "strategia" in Ancient Greek meant "commander's office" or "generalship," but the modern concept of "strategy" as a new military science emerged much later [01:15:15].

Language is constantly developing and changing [01:27:27]. The speaker suggests that modern dictionaries should be crowdsourced, incorporating a "bot network" to detect newly used words across social and non-social media [01:32:45]. This highlights the rapid evolution of language [01:42:55].

## Pre-Independence Alphabets in the Balkans

Before gaining independence, many nations under Ottoman rule, such as Serbs, Bulgarians, and Macedonians, largely lacked a widespread written culture [01:45:32]. The clergy were the primary literate group, often writing in Greek [01:46:00]. While a limited Slavic written literature began to form before the Ottoman conquest (1300s-1400s), including a Serbian printing house [01:46:16], Slavic languages were not widely written from the 15th to 18th centuries [01:46:38]. The 1820s-1830s saw a "Slavic renaissance," where the possibility of writing religious and secular works in their own languages was rediscovered, preceding their independence movements [01:46:53].

Croatians, who were not under direct Ottoman rule, primarily wrote in Italian, German, Hungarian, and Latin, as they were integrated into those cultures [01:47:13].

Bosnians, having converted to Islam, mostly wrote in Turkish using the Ottoman script, and sometimes in Serbian with the Ottoman script, aligning with Muslim culture [01:48:07].

The idea of Albanian as a written language only emerged around the 1870s [01:48:32]. While some marginal Albanian texts (correspondence) existed from the 16th century, a significant written culture did not develop until the end of the 19th century [01:48:54]. The Albanian alphabet was invented around 1878, likely at the Prizren Conference, and later adopted the Latin alphabet after dissatisfaction with the initial version [01:49:08]. This demonstrates the [[impact_of_albanias_religious_and_cultural_history | impact of Albania's religious and cultural history]] on its linguistic development.

## The Armenian Alphabet and Its Legacy

The Armenian alphabet is unique among old alphabets, having been invented in 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots from a village in Mus [01:55:05]. Mashtots not only created the alphabet but also assembled a team of 12-13 educated young individuals who translated the Bible and Greek Christian classics into Armenian [01:55:34]. This monumental effort created a vast Armenian literature, establishing the Armenian nation as one "known for its inclination towards writing, unlike neighboring nations" [01:55:49].

Before 405 AD, Armenians did not have a written language [01:56:00]. The aristocracy's written language was predominantly Pahlavi Persian [01:56:07], a dialect of Persian, used for royal decrees and board meetings [01:56:19]. Consequently, an "enormous amount of words passed into Armenian" from Iranian languages between the 1st and 5th centuries AD [01:56:42]. Many names of the Armenian aristocracy during this period were also Iranian [01:59:35].

The religious institution, separate from the state, leaned towards Greek culture [02:00:23]. While there was a Syriac-based cultural tradition, especially in southern Armenian provinces, where Syriac was used, the Armenian translators chose to translate primarily from Greek texts after 405 AD [01:57:09]. The "Saint Translators" were young scholars with strong Greek cultural backgrounds, many having studied in Istanbul, which was a world cultural center [01:57:40].

## The Urartian Language and Its Historical Context

Urartian was an inscription language, likely a "dead language," primarily used by kings for self-praise and worship [01:27:44]. There is no historical indication of a "people called Urartians" mentioned in any sources [01:28:08].

The Medes, a separate nation with two large countries (Iranian Kurdistan centered in Kermanshah and Iranian Azerbaijan centered in Tabriz), lived in a well-defined area in western Iran between 1000 BC and 550 BC [01:29:01]. They conquered the Urartians but did not settle their land [01:29:37]. The connection between the Medes and today's Kurds remains an "extremely big question mark" with conflicting theories [01:30:41].

Another distinct tribe, the Corduene, lived in the Şırnak and Hakkari provinces of today's Turkey [01:31:03]. These are considered ancestors or a group from whom the Kurds took their name around the 10th century [01:31:22].

Ultimately, while Kurds existed in Anatolia 150 years before the Turks arrived, and emerged as a political entity within modern Turkey's borders [01:33:12], their ancient history, particularly regarding connections to the Medes or Corduene, is not definitively known [01:32:43]. This highlights challenges in reconstructing [[revival_of_dead_languages_and_linguistic_history | linguistic history]] for ancient groups. The discussions around Urartian and Kurdish also touch upon the [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | cultural and linguistic history of Anatolia]].

Throughout his leadership, Josip Broz Tito, the long-standing leader of [[yugoslavias_political_history | Yugoslavia]], was involved in various notable transactions and diplomatic incidents with the United States. These anecdotes often highlight a complex relationship, marked by both strategic dealings and audacious trickery.

## The "Houston, We Have a Problem" Movie
A movie titled "Houston, We Have a Problem" reportedly details certain aspects of Tito's dealings with the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The speaker admits to feeling like he doesn't know anything about Tito after watching it, suggesting the film reveals surprising details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The film is described as a "mockumentary" or fictional documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

## The Sale of the Galata Bridge
One of Tito's alleged "greatest feats" was selling the Galata Bridge to the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This act is mentioned metaphorically, likening it to a "creep Osman" who sells things by deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The Fake Missile Program
A more significant anecdote involves Tito's alleged sale of a fake missile program to the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **American Failures** In the early 1960s, the Americans were struggling with their space missile program, experiencing repeated failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Yugoslavia's "Success"** It was rumored that [[yugoslavias_political_history | Yugoslavia]] had a very advanced missile program, capable of launching missiles towards space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **The Deal** The Americans, recognizing their lack of technology and Yugoslavia's lack of funds, sent high-level diplomats to negotiate a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. After tough bargaining, Tito supposedly sold this program to the Americans for $3 billion at the time, which is estimated to be $50 billion in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **The Deception** The program sold by Tito was reportedly entirely fake and non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The Americans spent 2-3 years trying to get it to work without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Aftermath**
    *   The Americans accused Tito of fraud and demanded their money back for the next 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   This incident became a major source of conflict between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   President Kennedy reportedly summoned Tito to New York and issued threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Coincidentally, during his visit, Yugoslav opponents attempted to assassinate Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Tito himself had different theories about who was behind the attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
    *   When American engineers couldn't get the program to work, Yugoslav engineers were sent to the U.S., but they also failed to achieve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Consequently, NASA or the relevant American team had to abandon the Yugoslav project and start from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   The fallout continued into Nixon's presidency, with threats to bomb [[yugoslavias_political_history | Yugoslavia]] and plans drawn up for its division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Six major Yugoslavian embassies and consulates in America were bombed within an hour to intimidate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   In an attempt to repay, the Yugoslavs offered to produce and provide Yugo cars to the Americans, describing them as "an amazing car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. However, the Yugo was widely considered "garbage" by Americans, leading to further outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The speaker expresses admiration for this "gangsterism" and "banditry story," particularly the act of "ripping off 50 billion dollars" from America, calling it a "really fun job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*Note: This specific anecdote about Tito selling a fake missile program and the subsequent events with the Galata Bridge and Yugo cars is often cited as a legendary story, notably explored in the film "Houston, We Have a Problem," which is a mockumentary and thus blurs the lines between fact and fiction.*

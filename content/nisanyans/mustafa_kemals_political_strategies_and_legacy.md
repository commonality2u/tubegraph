This article discusses the political strategies employed by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk during the early years of the Turkish Republic and examines his lasting legacy, including criticisms of his methods and the ideology of Kemalism.

## Core Political Objectives

The fundamental assumptions guiding Mustafa Kemal's actions were to re-establish the power of a collapsed state and to protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The speaker argues that these goals logically led to subsequent decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Mustafa Kemal was considered successful in his mission of saving and rebuilding the state and maintaining his power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. His initial appointment by the [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Union and Progress]] cadres and subsequent seizure of power meant that losing it would mean losing his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Strategies Employed

### National Mobilization and Propaganda

Mustafa Kemal aimed to make a strong move for the modernization struggle that the Ottomans had struggled with for a hundred years and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. In a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants, he sought to create a national excitement, even if "fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While elites in Istanbul and Izmir were perceived as "lukewarm," ordinary citizens were influenced by "stories of homeland, nation, Sakarya, and infidels who poured into the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Use of Force and Political Purges

A "tradition of intrigue" and political terror, inherited from the [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Union and Progress]] organization, was employed, with some individuals being hanged if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. In 1926, counter-deterrent measures were taken to stop the state's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The İzmir assassination, which occurred in 1926, is questioned as to whether it was real or merely an excuse to intimidate the opposition, a question that remains unanswerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The speaker suggests that "assassination colleges" can be found at every stage of a dictator's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This event was viewed as a "blessing from God" and used to purge [[mustafa_kemal_ataturks_political_appointments | old Union and Progress cadres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. Those who knew the inner workings of the "War of Independence" were targeted, including figures like former Finance Minister Cavit Bey, Vasıf Bey, and Kara Kemal Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. All seven individuals who signed the Amasya Declaration with Mustafa Kemal were tried with death penalty, although none were executed, including Kazım Karabekir, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and Rauf Orbay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This was described as a purge similar to those seen in the Soviet Union under Stalin or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The cadres who made the revolution were not necessarily the same as those suitable for governing, leading to "bloody fights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

### Foreign Policy Maneuvers

In a world where the outcome of conflicts between English and German powers was unclear, Mustafa Kemal tried to strike a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. When France's power was perceived to be waning, he saw an opportunity to break off a piece from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Personal Conduct and Criticisms

The speaker raises the question of whether Mustafa Kemal exhibited "signs of madness" after 1929-1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Examples cited include:
*   Theories of language and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The Dersim massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The liquidation of İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The purchase of the Savarona yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The purchase of the Savarona yacht in 1937, used by Atatürk for about a week, is described as one of the "most despicable and most pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history," born from the "boss's megalomania" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. The yacht later struggled for purpose, briefly serving as a training ship or a brothel, before being reportedly sold for razor blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   The decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

It is considered "difficult to protect what you like from the corrupting effect of absolute power," and those who claim they can are "lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The speaker also compares Mustafa Kemal's situation to that of Abdülhamid, noting the difficulty of escaping the "frame that fate has drawn" when leading an exhausted state while protecting one's own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact of Kemalism

### The Enduring "Icon"

Mustafa Kemal is viewed as an "icon" that needs to be "watched," with some hoping for a return to the pre-2002 era after Tayyip Erdoğan leaves power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The speaker believes this is a "dream world," as the process of Islam becoming the official state ideology is not easily reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The modernizing ruling class, which has governed for a century, has not "benefited the country" and has been unable to realize its claims of raising Turkey to a "contemporary civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that to challenge the "sacred atmosphere" around Mustafa Kemal, one must show that he was an "ordinary political leader" whose every action can be discussed based on "reason and benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. His book, "Wrong Republic," aims to encourage critical thinking by asking, "Are you sure? Have you tried looking at it from this perspective?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Critique of Kemalist Ideology and its Adherents

The problem lies with Mustafa Kemal's "disciples" today, not with the historical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Kemalism is described as a "sacred holy icon" in Orthodox churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> and the "flag of contemporary Turkish racism and state gatekeeping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It symbolizes a "moral blindness that a priori justifies all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation," encapsulated by the phrase, "If the issue is homeland, the rest is details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Kemalists are depicted as "half-educated" and prone to "spew hatred and complexes against the outside world" while failing to establish emotional communication with their own common populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Their "marginal accompaniment in the political field" forces them to embrace state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Nationalism, while a tool of populism globally, becomes a "pathology" in Turkey, characterized as a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The "Kemalist sect" is seen as rejecting Islam while attempting to water itself as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Their ideology is based on "Hakime arrogance," which leads to an inability to understand the rights of Turks or establish emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This "arrogance" also leads to "ignorance" regarding the Kurdish Parliament, a critical issue for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, and makes them incapable of understanding modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Many Kemalists are described as uncivilized, lacking respect, a smiling face, common sense, and moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The continued display of Kemalist symbols in government offices, from the smallest to the largest, signifies an abandonment of normal human logic and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This attitude, where the state is represented by an icon, means that reason and conscience are dismissed, leading to an oppressive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### "Democratic Kemalism" and Future Prospects

The idea of a "new and democratic Kemalism," as suggested by some young secular academics, is dismissed as a "complete dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. These academics are seen as marginalized, out of touch with the country, and deeply hateful of the majority population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The notion of a "totalitarian dictator of the 1930s becoming a more democratic symbol is an absurd idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

The speaker argues that Turkey would have existed without Mustafa Kemal; its 13 million people would not have been "destroyed" or "sent to Mongolia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. It is suggested that if someone else had been in his place in 1919 or 1923, similar outcomes would have occurred, albeit perhaps without a leader as "bright and brave" as Kemal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

## Historical Context and Alternatives

Turkey, as a country, has always been the "most open face of the Islamic world to the West at every stage of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. All innovations from the West post-1500s, such as the printing house, telescope, new military organization, and paper money, were first adopted in Turkey within the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

Before the period just prior to Mustafa Kemal's dominance, 25% of Turkey's population and over 30% of its economic structure were non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

The idea of "Islam as the official state ideology" is not easily reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The project of raising the country to the level of "contemporary, that is, the leading countries of the world was a complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The secular decline of the Ottoman Empire continued unchanged during the Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

Previous attempts to find a new ideal after the exhaustion of existing ones include Turgut Özal's globalist capitalist American model, which did not suit Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The Westernization project, pursued under the guise of European Union membership until 2011, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. In the absence of other alternatives, Islam has emerged as the unifying idea for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. This "helplessness" and lack of alternatives continue globally, where existing thought systems and political parties are "inadequate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

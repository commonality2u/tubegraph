This article explores various historical and contemporary examples of how cultural and societal factors influence political decisions, national identity, and international relations.

## Historical Political Axes and Societal Transformation

For 150 years, the main axis of Turkish politics has been determined by westernization [01:18:30]. Everything else is added to this core [01:18:42]. The Turkish left generally originated from the westernist tradition, often representing an extreme point of the westernization, modernization, and progress school [01:18:51]. After joining NATO in the 1950s, the Turkish left wavered, not knowing what line to take due to their instinctive westernism conflicting with America and NATO leading the West [01:19:14]. They turned to the Soviet Union or figures like Mao and Enver Hoca, which were not convincing choices, potentially contributing to their lack of effective political influence [01:19:31]. Few leftists in Turkey, such as İbrahim Kaypakkaya and Doctor Hikmet, were against Westernism, the preference of the Turkish bourgeoisie and urban ruling elites [01:20:01].

Conversely, the Islamist movement in Turkey during the 1950s and 1960s was violently anti-Western, though sometimes under the title of anti-Communism [01:20:52]. In the 1970s, with Erbakan, Turkish Islamism changed direction to become a carrier of the anti-Western front [01:21:20]. While the lines represented by Ibrahim Kaypakkaya and Süleyman Soylu (not Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) may not originate from a common pro-Western or anti-Western stance, they have evolved towards a common place [01:21:52]. These shifts highlight [[historical_and_political_transformation_in_global_power_dynamics | historical and political transformation in global power dynamics]] driven by [[cultural_and_educational_backgrounds_influencing_personal_and_political_perspectives | cultural and educational backgrounds influencing personal and political perspectives]].

## Societal Attitudes Towards Progress and Opposition

The opposition in Turkey faces criticism for its "politics of burden," which is seen as a reason for its lack of societal response [01:25:53]. Historically, groups like religious zealots, madrasah students, and segments of the central state have opposed new ideas, models, and things requiring intelligence, particularly those that increase the power of a segment of the central state [01:26:43]. This coalition of unwilling burdens has resisted innovation attempts in the Ottoman Empire since the 17th century [01:27:32].

Modern "ink-licked classes" in Turkey, such as engineers, architects, doctors, accountants, and lawyers, are seen as direct inheritors of this unwilling instinct [01:27:42]. Development and growth require risk-taking, and sometimes breaking and disintegrating [01:28:13]. While some development and investment activities in Turkey are viewed as destructive, the alternative of rejecting everything and embracing collective poverty is not courageous [01:28:36]. A cowardly group within Turkey's opposition has achieved social status, fearing loss if things shake, and are unable to accept alternatives like pursuing entrepreneurial ventures [01:29:08]. This highlights a societal fear of losing status and income, leading to a dead end in political action [01:29:42]. This also relates to [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical and modern societal transformations]].

## Geopolitical Shifts and Societal Reactions

The perceived softening and withdrawal of Tayyip Erdoğan since the elections, especially his attitudes before the NATO summit, meeting with "Zelensky scum," and sending back Azov militants, are considered thought-provoking developments [01:06:28]. The arrival of Mehmet Şimşek and the Central Bank general manager also raised concerns, suggesting financial pressure behind these changes [01:08:23]. It's implied that Turkey might be forced to take a side and make a decision in the context of the Ukraine war, with Western states' key figures signaling an expansion of the war front [01:10:09]. The speaker views Turkey's wavering stance on the war, which was previously positive, as problematic [01:11:45]. This is an example of [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | impact of historical events on current geopolitics]].

### Ukraine's 2014 Incident

The 2014 uprising in Ukraine (Euromaidan) is described as a "very clearly wrong," manipulated, and malicious event that caused a national disaster [01:31:54]. It was clear from the outset that it would lead to conflict [01:32:15]. Similar manipulations are suggested for the Georgian Revolution and events in Egypt, where countries were stirred up cynically and treacherously, leading people to the streets for coups, resulting in disaster [01:32:45]. The speaker acknowledges that while he doesn't know if the Gezi events in Turkey were similarly manipulated, Western powers have a strategy of exploiting legitimate complaints among urban youth to create chaos and overthrow disliked governments [01:33:13].

## Anti-Semitism and Religious Coexistence

Anti-Semitism is not universal [01:34:49]. For instance, there was no significant anti-Semitism in the Islamic world until the 20th century [01:35:04]. While Islam views non-Muslims as second-class citizens, historical records do not show widespread anti-Jewish rage in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, or Yemen [01:35:47]. The sudden rise of anti-Semitism in the Islamic world in the mid-20th century (1930s-1950s) is attributed to the establishment of Israel and its policies against Palestinians [01:36:14]. The conquest of an Islamic land by a small, historically despised people, perceived as backed by the West, was seen as an intolerable humiliation, leading to violent anti-Semitism [01:37:14]. This is a clear case of [[impact_of_historical_colonial_influences_on_modernday_morocco | impact of historical colonial influences on modernday Morocco]] (though the example is Israel/Palestine, the principle is the same regarding Western influence).

In contrast, Europe has experienced violent anti-Semitism since the Middle Ages, which has consistently existed, rising and falling over time [01:37:41]. This difference can be explained by the political structures of Islam and Christianity [01:38:35]. The Roman Empire, a vast, homogeneous entity, made Christianity its state religion, with the idea that non-Christians had no place within civilized society [01:38:43]. Jews stubbornly refused to join this common Christian platform, leading to their consistent rejection [01:40:08].

Islam, however, started as a minority movement that conquered the world through conquest [01:40:33]. It could not easily change people's religions [01:40:50]. In its brightest period (Abbasid era), a small portion of its ruled lands were Muslim [01:41:01]. Thus, Islam had to develop rules and systems for living with and governing diverse, non-Muslim populations from its inception [01:41:42]. The Christian world aimed to erase non-Christians by integrating them, while the Muslim world governed them [01:42:17]. By the 13th century, Europe was almost entirely Christian with a tiny minority, while the Islamic world had a large non-Muslim population [01:42:50].

## The Role of Tradition and Modernity in Culture

Regarding women's covering, the speaker notes that all cultures tell women to cover their adornments [01:44:05]. Some cultures equated all of a woman's body with adornment, while others focused on specific parts like breasts [01:44:31]. This reflects varying [[cultural_and_societal_norms | cultural and societal norms]].

## The Information Age and Stupidity

Despite easy access to information via the internet, the rate of stupidity in society has not decreased; on the contrary, it appears to be on the rise [01:48:23]. This is attributed to fear [01:48:49]. Firstly, people are afraid of the "cacophony" or overwhelming noise of too many voices, leading to disorientation and confusion [01:49:01]. Secondly, the internet has severely shaken trust in traditional arbiters of knowledge, including political, scientific, and religious leaders [01:49:47]. This lack of trust, combined with a perceived inadequacy of coherent arguments, leads people to "talk nonsense" [01:50:11]. This is seen as the most characteristic feature of the current period [01:50:36].

The debate over anonymous social media accounts raises issues of freedom and responsibility. Demanding ID copies for internet access is considered tyranny that restricts freedoms [01:51:27]. However, unchecked anonymous accounts (bots or non-consistent personalities) also restrict freedoms by spreading insults, lies, and misinformation [01:51:33]. The ideal solution is to allow "anonymous but real accounts" – those with consistent personalities and ideas, even if their identity is unknown – while suppressing bot accounts [01:51:56]. Many high-quality social media accounts are anonymous but consistent in their logical and developmental trajectory [01:53:30].

## Immutable Laws of History

When asked "what if" questions about history (e.g., "What if Abdulhamid II had not been overthrown?"), a good historian, understanding cause-and-effect relationships, often concludes that "it couldn't have been otherwise" [01:56:07]. This reflects a deterministic view of history, where every event has sufficient reason [01:58:10].

Regarding the late period of Abdulhamid's reign (post-1890s), the Ottoman Empire experienced significant economic, cultural, and administrative stagnation [01:58:52]. The administrative staff aged, and new generations were excluded from governance, leading to paralysis akin to the late Soviet period [01:59:22]. This internal stagnation contrasted sharply with the "tremendous breakthrough era" of the early 20th century, marked by rapid technological advancements (automobiles, telephones, airplanes, oil) and boiling political structures [01:00:12]. This lack of synchrony between the Ottoman state's stagnation and the outside world's rapid progress was unsustainable [01:00:43]. Rebellions like the Macedonian and Albanian Revolts, and the loss of Crete, were inevitable given the ripe conditions [01:01:09]. The speaker suggests that the Balkan War would have broken out even if Abdulhamid had not been overthrown, perhaps only delayed [01:02:03]. These views reflect [[historical_perspectives_on_the_balkans_and_its_impact_on_modern_politics | historical perspectives on the Balkans and its impact on modern politics]].

Even if the Ottomans had not joined World War I, the outcome regarding their territories would likely have been similar [01:03:06]. The British, for instance, needed to take Iraq due to the new era of oil, which was crucial for naval power in the 20th century [01:03:22]. The division of Ottoman territories among European powers was a "mathematical logic" driven by strategic resource needs and existing world balances, regardless of Ottoman involvement in the war [01:04:54].

Similarly, the "cleaning project" (likely referring to the Armenian Genocide) implemented by the Young Turk cadres, characterized as an "extremely scientific, extremely systematic, extremely bureaucratic destruction project," would not have been the same under Abdulhamid's older approach, but the outcome might not have been significantly different [01:06:16]. The speaker believes there would have been no major difference in the outcome if Abdulhamid had remained in power [01:06:50]. This perspective is a strong example of historical determinism, which impacts how [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical and modern societal transformations]] are viewed.

## Population and Economy

The claim that Turkey would be more prosperous without the Kurdistan region within its National Pact borders is contested [01:21:57]. While Kurdistan's contribution to national income might be lower, it is also a consumer market for Western companies [01:22:22]. The speaker argues that income is not neutrally distributed across Turkey, and a significant portion of the West's wealth comes from the "exploitation of Kurdistan" [01:23:04].

## Armenian Alphabet and National Survival

Mesrop, a citizen from Muş's open village (Hadise or Hadsiz village), is credited with inventing the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD [01:24:25]. The primary purpose was to translate the Bible into Armenian [01:25:12]. This invention is considered the most important turning point in Armenian history because it allowed the Armenian nation to continue as a distinct political and cultural entity despite severe blows from Byzantium and Iran in the late 4th century, which led to the destruction of cities and the end of the Armenian Kingdom by 428 AD [01:25:42]. Without the Armenian script and a Christian literature in their own language, Armenians would likely have assimilated into Zoroastrian Iranian or Greek cultures [01:27:25]. The creation of Armenian religious literature was key to their survival as a separate nation [01:28:03]. This is a powerful example of how cultural preservation, especially through language and literature, influences national survival and identity over centuries.

## Muş History and Demographic Shifts

At the beginning of the 19th century (200 years ago), almost all villages in the Muş plain were Armenian [01:29:44]. There was also a significant Kurdish population engaged in animal husbandry and seasonal migration, with various interactions between Kurdish highlanders and Armenian villagers [01:30:41]. The Muş Principality was a Kurdish principality, with its town predominantly Kurdish [01:30:55]. The Muş beys were often independent, collected their own taxes, and their army consisted of Kurdish Muslim and Yazidi soldiers [01:31:19]. Armenian villages were obliged to feed these soldiers in winter [01:32:52].

By the 1830s, the Ottomans liquidated Kurdish principalities like Muş and Bitlis, establishing a more central administration [01:33:17]. This upset the religious and tribal balance [01:33:42]. By the late 19th century, more than half of the Muş plain population was Muslim and Kurdish [01:33:53]. A large portion of Armenians preferred to become Muslim for social reasons during the 19th century [01:34:07]. Upon converting, they became Kurdish because their children, unable to attend Armenian schools, grew up speaking Kurdish, the common language of the city [01:34:20]. They also sought protection by attaching themselves to Kurdish tribes [01:34:45]. By the early 20th century, Armenians were a minority in Muş province, and by 1918, they were largely gone [01:34:59]. This demonstrates rapid [[societal_changes_and_historical_perspectives | societal changes and historical perspectives]] influenced by political shifts and cultural assimilation.

## Karaite Jews

Karaite Jews were a distinct Jewish sect that formed a large community in the Crimean Khanate until the 20th century [01:36:33]. They spoke a version of Crimean Tatar, a Turkish language, because Turkish was the common language of Crimea in public affairs [01:36:44]. After Crimea came under Russian rule, and particularly with Jewish pogroms in Russia in the late 19th century, the Karaites dispersed [01:38:05]. Some assimilated into mainstream Jewish communities, while a metropolitan portion migrated to Istanbul, speaking Turkish [01:38:17]. In Istanbul, a section of the Hasköy Jewish cemetery is reserved for Karaite graves, often with Cyrillic or Russian alphabets, but later Hebrew and Turkish [01:38:32]. The community quickly melted away in Istanbul, with most joining mainstream Jews or migrating to America or Israel [01:39:02]. Today, there is no longer a Karaite presence in Istanbul [01:39:16].

## Universal Human Instincts vs. Ideologies

The idea that compassion, humanism, justice, or social justice are products of Christianity is dismissed as absurd, prejudiced, and ignorant [01:41:30]. These feelings – giving a hand to the weak, recognizing equality of rich and poor, and societal obligation to help the vulnerable – are described as universal human instincts present across various cultures and historical periods, including the Stone Age, ancient Greece, Muslims, and Buddhists [01:41:50]. The feeling of socialism exists wherever there are people [01:42:37].

Similarly, competition and dynamic hierarchy, where the strong oppress the weak, are also unchangeable characteristics of humanity [01:43:40]. Presenting either one as the "absolute definition of a person" is considered nonsense [01:44:04]. Society functions by balancing these two basic human instincts: the sense of responsibility towards all individuals and the individual desire for self-preservation and advancement [01:45:26]. When either pole goes too far, society becomes "sick," requiring correction [01:45:58]. This perspective challenges dogmatic ideologies and highlights the complex, dual nature of human societies.

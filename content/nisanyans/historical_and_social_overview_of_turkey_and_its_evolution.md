## 2023 Overview and Geopolitical Stance

In a 2023 evaluation, there were no significant worldwide events attributed directly to [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Globally, [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] faced an "economic, demographic, and military turning point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>. Domestically, the "Republican People's Party balloon," which had been "inflated for a few years," reportedly burst in 2023, "never to be inflated again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

[[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] is considered an "important cornerstone of the Western alliance" and a significant military nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. Historically, the assumption since 1933-1934, and certainly since 1946, has been that [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] is and will remain part of the Western alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This stance has been a basic assumption in global war preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.

### Western Strategies Towards Turkey

Since the inception of the Erdoğan government, "very serious doubts" have arisen in the Western world regarding [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]'s continued alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. This has led to different strategies from approximately 2007 to 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. Initially, Western powers planned to remove Tayyip Erdoğan through a "military coup" or a "mixed military-civilian coup" to install "cadres that are loyal to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. This effort did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

From 2016 or 2017 onwards, projects to change the government through elections began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. The hope was to unite the Republican People's Party with other parties to achieve a slight electoral victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. This "ended in a fiasco" in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Following the last election, there was an apparent acceptance of Tayyip Erdoğan's reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>, leading to a new strategy aimed at "marginalizing Tayyip Erdoğan and limit his influence within the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

### Middle East Dynamics

The current situation in the Middle East is significant for understanding [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]'s role, as a war there is "extremely strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. In such a conflict, the roles of Saudi Arabia and [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>. Unlike Iran, Lebanon, or Syria, whose attitudes are clear, or Egypt, which will remain neutral, Saudi Arabia and [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]'s positions are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.

Saudi Arabia, previously a "servant of the Western military alliance," has undergone radical changes in the last year, initiating a "rebellion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. It has made peace with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>, ended its covert war in Yemen, and accepted defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. Furthermore, it signed a military cooperation and friendship agreement with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>, agreed to sell oil and natural gas in non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>, and is set to join BRICS, a club of countries seeking to operate outside American financial hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. During the Gaza War, Saudi Arabia maintained a "frightening silence," adopting a "wait and see policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.

[[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]], conversely, continues to support Israel economically through a long-standing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>. While still an ally in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>, its head of state has adopted "extremely provocative and extremely worrying" propaganda and attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>. If war erupts between Arab countries and Israel, [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]'s role would be "vital" and a "matter of life and death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]]'s non-participation alongside Arab states in such a conflict is "a vital issue for Israel and for Western countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.

## Internal Political and Social Dynamics

Football events in 2023, which featured "racist" provocations, are suggested to be evaluated within the context of current regional dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. The underlying "Arab hostility" in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]], which periodically surfaces, is also a long-standing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. The persistence of an "old dictator cult" for 80 years, despite being "resurrected every time," is noted, with questions raised about who keeps it alive and for what interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. These aspects are seen as keys to understanding [[political_history_of_turkey | political events in Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

### Constitutional Debates

The question of a new constitution for [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] is deemed moot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. The "era of constitutions is over" because the government systematically disregards decisions of the Constitutional Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>. For a constitution to be meaningful, political and powerful social actors must agree upon and believe in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. Additionally, an arbitration institution "above all kinds of political considerations" is necessary, a concept that has also been "eliminated from the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>. Constitutional crises are seen in almost every country, not just [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.

The idea that countries are founded on written rules emerged in the 18th century from social contract theorists, first systematically attempted in the United States and then France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a>. By the 19th century, the notion of constitutional governance became prevalent, except in England, which famously lacked a written constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>. England's lack of a written constitution was underpinned by an "elite consensus" among its governing cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>. However, such a consensus no longer exists, and those who believe countries can still be governed by written constitutions are "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

### Ethnic and Social Groups in the Republic

There is a significant [[continuity_and_change_in_turkish_history | continuity]] between the Ottoman Empire's state order and that of the Republic, with 80-90% of state cadres (excluding top executive) continuing in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. The Republic's political cadres, including deputies and party leaders, largely emerged from the Committee of Union and Progress, particularly after 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>. Many who opposed the new cadres were executed or forced into exile by 1926 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.

In analyzing the [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | social history of the Republic]], four influential groups are highlighted:
*   **Circassians**: Expelled from their homeland in the 1860s and 70s, they held a strong sense of gratitude to the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. They were armed and eager to fight against non-Muslims and foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. Their loyalty to the Turkish state and determination to fight were proven, despite initial wavering between Istanbul and Ankara governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Their armed tribal organization tradition made them particularly effective in struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>.
*   **Balkan and Rumelian Turks**: Similar to Circassians, they experienced expulsion from their homelands and were determined to prevent a repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Black Sea people**: Possessing a tradition of conflict and self-protection, they formed a significant diaspora in Istanbul and Western cities after the 1950s due to economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. This group became influential in politics and state administration through strong solidarity, sometimes employing illegal means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   **Kurds**: Especially since the 1990s and 2000s, Kurds gained unprecedented influence and power in major cities and Western provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. While facing discrimination in state bureaucracy, they are increasingly gaining key political positions through political means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

### Language and Assimilation Policies

The question of whether the fate of Syrians in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] will be similar to past assimilation policies is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>. The Republic's early period focused on forcibly convincing groups, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to speak Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. Those who did not comply faced harassment, punishment, and expulsion from various institutions until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>. It is considered "pathetic" that these facts have been forgotten, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is still remembered as a "progressive, civilized, polite symbol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>. The "policy of creating a nation state" and a "nation" was implemented similarly across countries in the region throughout the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>.

The term "greengrocers" (`manavlar`) refers to local Muslims in the South Marmara region (Bursa, Balıkesir, Bilecik, Sakarya, Kocaeli, and parts of Eskişehir) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Research suggests a large part of them in the early 15th century (or earlier) were Rums (Byzantine subjects) who became Muslims under Turkish rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. A strong "substratum infrastructure" of Greek origin is evident in their traditions and cultural characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:33">[01:52:33]</a>. Evidence of old churches in their villages supports this, with no indication of population change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:46">[01:52:46]</a>. While having Byzantine Greek origins, they are considered "Turkified" because "being Turkish is something that is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>.

### Naming Conventions in Minority Groups

Historically, until the 19th century, a large portion of Armenians in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] had Turkish names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>. With the rise of national consciousness and education in the 19th century, they rejected Turkish names, adopting "pure Armenian names" or Christian saint names, or for elites, names of kings and aristocrats, some of Iranian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>.

For Jews, Hebrew was a revived language in the 20th century, not their primary historical language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:27">[01:59:27]</a>. In [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] until recent generations, Sephardic Jews predominantly spoke Ladino (a Spanish dialect) and had names of Hebrew (Torah origin), Spanish, or Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>. However, even their Turkish names often differed from those of Turks, making their Jewish identity discernible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:25">[02:00:25]</a>. After 1920, there was a trend among Jews to use their own names or camouflaged Western names, such as Janet and Vivet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:44">[02:00:44]</a>. Currently, they are adopting new Hebrew names common in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>.

## Historical Context: Ottoman Empire's Decline and Republican Foundation

### Abdulhamid II's Reign (1876-1909)

Sultan Abdulhamid II's reign, particularly after 1890, is described as a period of "stagnation and decay," a "blockage" marked by deep silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. Educated people in the country desired to emigrate, with many going to Paris or Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>. Egypt, at the time, was experiencing a "cultural and intellectual economic breakthrough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>. There was a strong sense that the Ottoman Empire was "exhausted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>. Blood circulation in managerial cadres had ceased, leading to an aging, increasingly corrupt administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:33">[01:55:33]</a>. The Empire appeared as a "Miskinler Tekke" (Dervish lodge of the poor), a spirit captured in Tevfik Fikret's poem "Sis" (Fog) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.

By 1908, nearly everyone in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Turkey]] — Turkish, non-Muslim, Westernist, Ottomanist, Kurd — had lost hope in the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. Qualified cadres were imprisoned, exiled, or assigned to remote posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:19">[01:57:19]</a>. The Abdulhamid regime, despite its perceived grandeur, collapsed with "a single telegram" in 1908, reflecting its internal decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. The collapse led to widespread celebrations, briefly fostering optimism that the Ottoman order could be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. However, this optimism lasted only six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

### Reforms and Downfall

Abdulhamid II, though sometimes described as treacherous and cruel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>, initiated significant reforms in his early years (from 1876), aiming to revive the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. He prioritized education, establishing a middle and high school system nationwide, along with a law school and a university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. He also advanced the medical field, notably founding a rabies and microbiology hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. These "modernize the country" efforts included establishing sericulture and agricultural schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

His approach, similar to early Mustafa Kemal Pasha, sought to fix the country through reforms and centralized control, believing "excessive politicization is not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. However, he soon realized the Empire's "texture" did not allow for this, and it could no longer be sustained internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. Attempts to reconcile diverse ethnic groups proved impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. His policy of banning politics and relying on bureaucratic/technocratic methods ultimately caused "flowing water that you silenced" to "stagnate and turn into a swamp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. What began with hope transformed into a system cursed by all by the end of his 33-year reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.

### Ottoman Legacy and the Republic

The Ottoman Empire's end, both legally and de facto, marked a "change of era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. The Empire is increasingly seen as a "resurrection of the Rum" (Byzantine Empire), gaining new staff, ideology, and mixed with a new mortar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. Byzantium's loss of control over Anatolia and Rumelia from the 7th century led to a dark period, followed by a revival in the 10th-12th centuries with new cities, trade, and independent local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. Byzantium's inability to govern this structure was largely due to the Church's immense power, which "blocked the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>. When the Ottomans captured Byzantium, they attributed its collapse to the Church's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. They then established a new political formation, "the Byzantium of the Turks," in 1453, operating Church properties as fiefs and prioritizing economic benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. This led to a brief "great economic and cultural revival" before it, too, became "blocked and ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.

## Social and Cultural Phenomena

Traditional Turkish house architecture, exemplified in Birgi, is characterized by inward-looking facades facing a courtyard, with a "dead" stone wall facing the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:59">[01:45:59]</a>. This contrasts with Greek houses in Şirince, which are outward-looking with beautiful facades facing the street, reflecting different cultural norms regarding privacy and social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. This subtle difference in orientation points to a deep [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | cultural difference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>.

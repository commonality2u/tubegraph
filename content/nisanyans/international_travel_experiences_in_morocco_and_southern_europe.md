## Overview of the Trip
A recent three-week journey covered various regions of Morocco and extended into Southern Europe [00:00:42]. The trip began as an organized group tour, with initial preparations made by the speaker, their website manager Fırat, and another individual [00:00:50]. This preliminary phase was followed by a tour with 38 friends, primarily focused on Marrakech and the southern parts of Morocco [00:01:05].

### Southern Morocco
The organized tour covered areas around [[travel_experiences_in_marrakech_and_morocco | Marrakesh]], specifically the southern part of the country [00:01:13]. After the group tour concluded, the speaker and a companion decided to extend their [[travel_experiences_and_challenges_in_morocco_and_spain | travels]] to explore the northern regions of Morocco [00:01:27].

### Northern Morocco and Strait of Gibraltar
Their journey continued as far as Tangier, located near the Strait of Gibraltar [00:01:29].

## Extension to Southern Europe
From Tangier, the travelers found a very cheap flight from Malaga, Spain, to [[life_and_moving_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] [00:01:41]. This led them to take a ferry to Spain, specifically from Malaga [00:01:46].

### Granada and Alhambra Palace
While in Spain, they decided to visit Granada to see the Alhambra Palace [00:01:58]. The entrance area in front of the Alhambra was described as incredibly crowded, with "the entire world's population" seemingly gathered there, making it impossible to get a ticket for three days [00:02:09].

### Travel Challenges in Spain
During their visit to Granada, a significant setback occurred: their passports and the journey's income of approximately $2,000 were stolen [00:02:26]. This left them stranded and requiring travel documents [00:03:02]. They traveled to Madrid to seek assistance from the Greek and Armenian consulates [00:03:06]. The consulates provided travel documents, but these restricted their movement to Greece and Armenia respectively [00:03:18]. As a result, the speaker's wife departed on a flight to Athens, while the speaker had to wait for a midnight flight to Yerevan, Armenia [00:03:32]. From Yerevan, the speaker plans to return to [[life_and_moving_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] [01:17:09].

## Observations on Morocco
Morocco is described as a "magnificent" [00:00:42] and "beautiful country" [00:04:09], though it suffers from "too many tourists" [00:04:10]. The speaker expressed a dislike for European crowds [00:04:17].

### Modernity and Cleanliness
Morocco is seen as a "docile," "humane," and "civilized country" [00:04:29]. During their journey, particularly in the northern part, discussions arose about whether Morocco or Türkiye was more modern [00:04:46].
*   **Modern parts of cities:** Modern areas of Moroccan cities are "extremely Europe" [00:05:21], clean, orderly, and contemporary [00:05:54]. Rabat was particularly striking in this regard [00:05:51].
*   **Cleanliness:** Morocco is considered a cleaner country than Türkiye, Egypt, and Iran, indicating efficient municipal services [00:05:31].
*   **Old cities:** Unlike Türkiye, Morocco's old cities are vast and have been preserved in their original detail, with no noticeable modern structures [00:06:16]. Examples include Marrakech's Medina [00:06:22].
*   **Rural areas:** In the southern rural areas, a lifestyle from centuries ago persists [00:07:00].
*   **Modernity Assessment:** The speaker believes Morocco is a "few steps ahead of Türkiye" in certain aspects of modernity, while also acknowledging that one end of its social spectrum has entered the 21st century less than Türkiye [00:07:17].

### [[impact_of_historical_colonial_influences_on_modernday_morocco | Impact of French Colonialism]]
The 40-50 years of French rule significantly influenced Morocco [00:07:36]. French is widely spoken, and official signs and offices are in French, often not even using Arabic [00:07:44]. This presence of "European polish" [00:08:06] contrasts with the preservation of many traditional social orders [00:08:16].

### [[political_and_social_dynamics_in_morocco_and_similar_regions | Political and Social Dynamics]]
Slogans such as "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (God, the Homeland, the King) are common, similar to nationalistic slogans in Türkiye [00:08:39]. The King is highly revered, with his photographs displayed ubiquitously [00:08:59]. Older, conservative individuals tend to speak cautiously about the King, while younger, modern, secular-leaning middle-class women show "fanatic" loyalty to the King, which is observed as an "astonishing social equivalence" to Kemalist fanaticism in Türkiye [00:09:29].

### Highlights of the Trip
1.  **Sahara Desert Camp:** An unforgettable experience in the Sahara desert near the Mauritania border, requiring a two-hour jeep ride followed by a camel ride [00:12:13]. The environment was described as unique and awe-inspiring [00:12:40].
2.  **Jemaa el-Fna Square (Marrakech):** This square is considered one of the most unique places globally, bustling with activity 24 hours a day [00:13:12]. During the day, it hosts storytellers, snake charmers, fortune tellers, and various vendors [00:13:39]. In the evening, it transforms into a vibrant food market with diverse, delicious, and affordable food [00:13:56]. The atmosphere is further enhanced by Berber musicians [00:14:41]. While initially enjoyable, managing a large group in its chaos became tiring [00:15:10]. The square has become "extremely touristic" [00:15:40].
3.  **Fez Bazaar:** The bazaar in Fez is described as unique and larger than the Marrakech Bazaar, preserving its historical character [00:15:30]. It offers breathtaking beauty at every turn, with intricate doors, courtyards, palaces, and madrasahs showcasing a past civilization that rivaled 15th-16th century Europe [00:16:04].
    *   **Craftsmanship:** The Fez Bazaar actively features manufacturing tradesmen, giving it a medieval feel, unlike Türkiye where crafts are largely "dead" [00:17:00]. Artisans, particularly those over 50, engage in incredible work in various trades like carpentry, tiling, lamp-making, and leather [00:17:39]. However, it's noted that this traditional handicraft tradition may decline in 20-30 years as younger generations are less involved [00:18:41].
4.  **Claudio Bravo's Palace:** Located in Taroudant, southern Morocco, this palace was built by Chilean artist Claudio Bravo, a prominent figure in 20th-century anti-modernism [00:19:07]. He earned considerable wealth painting portraits of various historical figures and used it to construct this desert palace [00:19:44].
    *   **Artistic Taste and Wealth:** The palace stands out as an example of immense wealth combined with refined artistic taste and education, a rarity in the modern world where large fortunes are often associated with "uncouth people" [00:20:13]. Bravo's art was classical and disciplined, in the style of Velasquez, with occasional modernist influences [00:21:15].
    *   **Future of the Palace:** Bravo died a few years after building the palace, leaving no heirs. His inheritance was left to his driver, who, though likeable, is not equipped to manage such an estate [00:22:03]. The speaker believes the palace will inevitably deteriorate without proper management [00:22:51].
    *   **Conditions for Sustaining a Palace:** To sustain a palace across generations, two conditions are deemed necessary:
        *   **Long-term Income:** A stable, long-term source of income, ideally agricultural land, as modern financial instruments are volatile [00:24:55].
        *   **Multiple Heirs:** Numerous children, increasing the chance that at least one will be capable and willing to continue the work [00:26:09].
        *   Without these, creating lasting beauty in the modern world is not possible [00:26:24].

## Current Travel Situation and Future Plans
Currently in Vienna airport, the speaker is awaiting a flight to Yerevan, Armenia, to obtain a new passport after the robbery in Spain [00:00:18]. Following this, they will return to [[life_and_moving_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] [01:17:09]. Their companion's situation is more prolonged, expecting to stay in Greece for two weeks [01:17:26]. The entire ordeal is a result of being robbed in Spain, losing passports, a driver's license, money, and reading glasses [01:17:30].

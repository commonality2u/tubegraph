The discussion on orphanhood and adoption arose from a question posed by Can Turhan's wife, asking whether homosexual couples should be able to adopt, and if not, whether a child's only chance is to remain in an orphanage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

## Ideal Family Structure

The speaker's primary view is that mothers should raise children, as a healthy child grows under the mother's guidance and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. In addition to the mother, the father should also be present in the family as an authority figure and a final reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This perspective is based on the speaker's [[personal_reflections_on_family_separation | personal observations and life lessons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

## Challenges of Orphanhood

Children who do not grow up under the supervision and control of both parents often become problematic, sick, unhappy, and difficult individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. The speaker has observed the developmental trajectories of those raised in orphanages, noting that growing up in such environments is generally "not a good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Considering Alternative Solutions

Given that life and society do not always offer ideal solutions, and sometimes deal a "very bad hand" to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, alternative arrangements must be considered as "the lesser evil" when a mother and father cannot be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This applies to situations where there is no gender balance or the traditional compassion and authority of both parents are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

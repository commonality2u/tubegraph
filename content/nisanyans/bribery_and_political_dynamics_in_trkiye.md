The discussion on [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | political dynamics in Trkiye]] often involves the topic of corruption and the integrity of its [[turkish_politics_and_elections | political systems]]. A significant event frequently referenced in this context is the 17-25 December 2013 investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## The 17-25 December 2013 Investigations
In December 2013, specifically on the 17th and 25th, a series of investigation reports emerged that seriously implicated then-Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan and individuals closely associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. For about three months following these dates, the market was significantly affected by these revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Audio recordings of meetings involving Tayyip Erdoğan, his son, his ministers, and various other individuals became public, leading to an "incredible scandal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

It is asserted that in any typical democratic nation, such revelations would have necessitated the immediate withdrawal of the government from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. In a normal regime, wise individuals within the parliament and ruling party would have advised resignation for the sake of investigation security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The material uncovered by the police at that time appeared convincing, including a dialogue attributed to Tayyip Erdoğan and his son discussing "hiding the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This dialogue, in particular, seemed difficult to fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## The Nature of Bribery in Trkiye
It is widely understood that a significant "bribery wheel" exists in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Trkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Bribery is described as a specific mechanism that has historically underpinned various dealings in Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. There is no indication that the situation was different during the regime in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Those involved in giving and taking bribes are said to hide their actions, record them, and use these recordings as blackmail when opportune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
The events of 2013 in Trkiye are viewed as potentially aiming for a regime change under the guidance of the CIA and the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The objective might have been to use Trkiye as a "battering ram" against Russia, similar to how Ukraine is currently being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This aspect requires further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### Comparison to Ukraine
A parallel is drawn between the [[political_climate_and_unrest_in_trkiye | political changes in Turkey]] and events in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the US reportedly gained control of the country from within starting in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. By 2014, a bloody coup brought their preferred figures to power, establishing a regime to be used as a weapon against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This resulted in Ukraine's destruction, unlikely to recover for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The question arises whether the same target and strategy were intended for Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

### The July 15 Coup Attempt
Another question is posed regarding the 2016 July 15 coup attempt in Trkiye: if it had succeeded and Trkiye transformed into a "black state" like Ukraine, would it have been glorified and used against Russia and Iran by a globalist team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>? This is described as a pertinent question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Türkiye's Role in Global Strategy
A strategy to create a "World War II front" is mentioned, extending from Finland and Sweden, through Poland, and then Ukraine, with Trkiye forming another part of this front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. It is asserted that Trkiye "spoiled this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

A drone attack occurred on the Kremlin approximately two to three months prior to the speaker's visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This event led to significant, albeit localized, internet disruptions in [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Moscow]].

## Immediate Effects: Internet Disruption

To confuse potential drones, the internet was cut off for about a minute every ten minutes within a one-kilometer radius of the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The speaker directly experienced these [[experiences_with_internet_disruptions_in_russia | internet disruptions]] while staying in a luxurious hotel near the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, noting its disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While the current location for the broadcast offers "wonderful internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, there is generally no "problem-free internet in the city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The speaker notes that the internet issues were particularly prevalent in the area directly across from Putin's office, where some "security measures" were in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although there were known ways to bypass these disruptions (e.g., using a VPN or moving two blocks away to a cafe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, the hotel's balcony was forbidden due to concerns about potential "rifle attacks" on Putin's nearby office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Broader [[impressions_of_daily_life_in_russia_amidst_conflict | Social and Political Impressions of Moscow]]

Despite the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Russia-Ukraine conflict]], there is "not the slightest sign that this country is at war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Normal life continues, with concerts, cinemas, and theaters full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. People are busy with their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and no signs of fear or tension were observed among the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Similarly, police or soldiers are rarely seen on the streets, with only one or two officers observed during a day and a half in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. There were no instances of people being asked for IDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Recent elections in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] have highlighted significant aspects of public perception and the role of various influences within the [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | political landscape]]. Many citizens who had convinced themselves of a government change were left disappointed, having prepared for celebrations on May 14th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The speaker wished them "get well soon" due to their dashed hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Election Outcomes

Several intertwined factors are identified as contributing to the election results:

### Concentration of Power
The government possesses a "superpower" due to a concentration of authority in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] that has existed for many decades, notably since the 1930s. This entrenched power is not easily relinquished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The opposition lacked a comparable force to challenge this deeply rooted power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Lack of a Strong Political Alternative
There was no significant social excitement or emotional explosion that could create an opposing power element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The political leadership and alternative were lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The candidate put forth, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, was characterized as "probably the most incompetent and most doomed to defeat person in the history of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He had consistently lost multiple elections, maintaining a stable vote share around 24-25%, even after incorporating three additional parties into his alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Misunderstanding of Social Dynamics by Educated Classes
A significant segment of society, referred to as "White Turks" or the educated classes, demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of social dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
- They failed to grasp why a large portion of society supports Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
- Their own discourse and attitudes were perceived as "ridiculous and disgusting" by many, a fact they could not comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
- Accused others of bigotry while being "incredibly bigoted" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
- They propagated narratives calling people ignorant, stupid, or implying they sold their votes for trivial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
- This group failed to represent any dynamism or offer appealing solutions to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
- Their reliance on a retired civil servant as a candidate, hoping his "Western image" and watered-down Atatürkism would sway an 86-million-person country, revealed a deep ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### The Role of Social Media in Public Perception
The earthquake in [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] did not significantly alter political preferences in affected cities like Maraş, where Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won with 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. This contradicted predictions from "dear social media family" who expected a political "earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. Social media was seen as a platform where less educated classes decided Erdoğan was responsible for the earthquake, assuming people would then hate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

Regarding democracy in the internet age, the speaker believes there is a *decrease* in democracy, not an increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
- Information bombardment on the internet reduces people's rational decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.
- It fosters a "herd mentality," where people choose a "pole" and follow it without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
- The internet is largely under state control, further diminishing democratic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
- This leads to the vast majority of society becoming "completely passive," confined to sharing emojis on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

### Election Polls and Manipulation
The phenomenon of polling is described as increasingly ineffective propaganda, especially over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.
- Political players have learned to manipulate polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.
- The public has also learned to lie in response to pollsters, rendering results unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>.
- All major survey companies reported similar, ultimately inaccurate, rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>.

### The Opposition's "Winning" Campaign
The opposition's "We are winning" campaign, which claimed a first-round victory, was a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.
- Voters were initially prepared for a second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.
- The aggressive first-round victory narrative demotivated voters when it failed, leading to disappointment and a lack of desire for a second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.
- The opposition now faces the challenge of re-motivating its disillusioned base for the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Societal Divisions

The election results reveal a multi-colored [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | map]] of [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]]:
- The central part of the country is largely yellow (government-supporting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.
- A thin strip in the west, encompassing cities like Istanbul, Thrace, Çanakkale, Izmir, and Muğla, represents another distinct bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>.
- A large bloc in the southeast, predominantly Kurdish, forms a third distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">[01:34:18]</a>.

There is "no consistency" or "connection" between these opposition blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>. The political alliance among them is "extremely superficial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>. The Southeast, in particular, is described as a "region in rebellion" with a homogeneously Kurdish population (over 80%) who are proud of their Kurdish identity, speak Kurdish, and do not consider themselves Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>. This region has a separate history, culture, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>. In a highly polarized state, the speaker believes [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]]'s political unity cannot be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Potential Scenarios
The speaker expresses the belief that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has become a burden [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | Turkey]] can no longer carry and "must go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. However, this is not expected to happen through elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
Two main possibilities are considered for the future of [[turkeys_political_landscape_after_recent_elections | Turkey]]:
1.  **Continuation of the current regime**: The speaker gives this possibility a 75% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This implies that "the old bathhouse, the old stone will continue" for the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Controlled removal of Erdoğan by his inner circle**: This is deemed the "second strongest possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. It suggests a scenario where someone within Erdoğan's own staff gradually removes him from power in an "apparently legal environment and in a decent manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that predicting the future is not their aim; rather, they seek to offer logical alternative scenarios to broaden people's horizons and encourage more rational and creative decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

## Conclusion on Public Perception
[[Turkish political landscape and elections | Turkish society]] is described as "extremely pragmatic" and "extremely opportunist," with a more flexible mindset than European societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. It is not inherently conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>; rather, it is a "covert society" that will abandon current idols if offered an attractive alternative that makes them "feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Merely insulting or condescending to them by calling them "inferior" or "stupid" is not a viable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The question becomes whether a candidate presenting a "miserable kitchen" image can inspire, or one who promises to "conquer the world together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

The topic of LGBT and its role in society is acknowledged as an issue where any answer given is likely to upset someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Perceptions of LGBT

It is questioned whether the LGBT community constitutes a "Per organized issue" or even a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While it may not have reached that point yet, it is perceived to be moving rapidly in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

In the Western world, the LGBT movement is seen as having transformed beyond a human rights claim into something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It is viewed as a "mistake of knitting" that states, particularly the American State, systematically use to create pressure on society and restrict its power and freedom of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Any organization that emerges in the United States seems to quickly become a tool for total leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This development is described as "very strange" and "very worrying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Mutual Consent and Societal Norms

A fundamental question arises: "Can two or more people really do whatever they want with mutual consent?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Another related question is, "When does sexual orientation become sexual perversion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

From the perspective of traditional liberal and libertarian thought, dating back to the 18th-century Enlightenment, anything adults do mutually and of their own free will that does not harm third parties is considered free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This idea is described as valuable and instrumental in humanity's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

However, a counter-argument emphasizes the fact that [[cultural_and_societal_norms | society]], partly for biological reasons and partly to protect its own peace and tranquility, imposes certain norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Ignoring these [[cultural_and_societal_norms | norms]] when considering actions taken with mutual consent may overlook potential social harms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. [[cultural_and_societal_norms | Societies]], through their ceremonies and traditions, establish rules of living together that define their distinction from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The discussion returns to whether perversions based on mutual consent between adults should be considered freedom, or if [[cultural_and_societal_norms | society]] has the right to defend its own values and traditions against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The argument for promoting human life through more beautiful and peaceful solutions is always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Impact on Population Decrease

A perspective suggests that global population reduction is being actively worked on through technical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. In Western countries, there has been a tremendous decrease in fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The destruction of the institution of marriage naturally reduces the tendency to have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

The promotion and glorification of transsexual and homosexual identities are cited as factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. As a result, the number of individuals who prefer homosexual relationships in society has increased enormously, with figures like 20% mentioned for the United States today, compared to a historical norm of around 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This is seen as turning a personal preference into an action that radically reduces population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

Other factors contributing to population decrease include:
*   Marriage being put aside for career, profession, and money-earning in labor life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   Promotion of non-fertile sexuality types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   Abortion being approved as a birth control method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Sexual Topics and Religion

A question is raised about why Islam, despite coming from the same geography as other religions, appears to have more sexual topics, specifically "dry Nuri chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. It is debated whether this is a historical embodiment of Islam or a feature of Islam that has become an obsession with sexual matters in its current, "degenerate" form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Judaism is also noted to have a similar aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

Religions like Judaism and Islam claim to regulate every moment of life, every act, and thus inevitably include significant dimensions related to sexuality, sexual relations, and sexual behavior, including marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. While regulating sexual life within values is seen as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>, it is asserted that the "People's Islam" or Islam experienced in the modern world has become an obsession with sexual roles and cleanliness, deviating from its historical tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

The shaking of sexual roles in [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | society]] by modernity, particularly in traditional societies like those influenced by the Ottoman Empire, was perceived as a significant threat, especially by lower classes adhering to traditional lifestyles and family structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. [[traditional_and_modern_societal_challenges | Urbanization]] and migration from villages to cities are suggested as reasons for this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. Village life is described as having much looser sexual roles and being lived more naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. When people of village origin migrate to cities and have to constantly deal with specific living spaces for men and women, this can lead to "sexual obsessions" articulated through religious discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

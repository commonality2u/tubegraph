Aramaic, also known as Syriac and including the Urfa dialect, served as the dominant language across the entire Middle East around 1000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. Its reach extended across Mesopotamia, Babylon, Syria, Palestine, and Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. It was among the first civilizations globally to systematically develop a written culture, producing extensive written works from 700 to 800 BC onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Aramaic was also a pioneer in the use of alphabetic writing, with Phoenician being identified as a dialect of Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

## Aramaic as a Cultural and Administrative Language

By 500 BC, when the Persian Empire conquered the Middle East, Aramaic was adopted as the official administrative (Divan) language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>. This was because the conquered region possessed a superior culture to that of the Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. Although Persian inscriptions were used by the high aristocracy, military, and kings, state and cultural affairs, along with trade, were conducted in Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. Consequently, Aramaic flourished for a millennium as the common cultural language of the Persian Empire, spanning from the Mediterranean to the Great Wall of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

## Transition to Arabic and Enduring Influence

Around the 6th century, growing Arab tribes, particularly in the desert-to-green-field transition zones of southern and eastern Syria and southern and western Iraq, began to destabilize the existing empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This rise, coupled with Byzantium's economic weakening, led to new balances in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. The nomadic and warrior Arabs began to challenge settled Aramaic-speaking communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.

Eventually, a significant Arab revolution led to the political domination of the region and the formation of an [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arab Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This shift resulted in Arabic largely replacing Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. However, Arabic, stemming from a more primitive social structure, absorbed much from Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. This was particularly evident in vocabulary related to written culture, law, literature, and religion, as Aramaic had a well-established written tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.

Aramaic played a crucial role in [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | religious texts]] of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. Both Christians and Jews in the region utilized Aramaic as their common religious literary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. The Talmud, a significant Jewish religious work, was compiled in Aramaic between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD, as were all Torah commentaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. While early Christian religious works were primarily in Greek, Christian culture from the 4th-5th centuries onward came under the strong influence of Aramaic, with Syriac-produced books becoming more numerous and content-rich than Greek ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.

Despite its initial widespread use, Aramaic gradually faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. Even in the time of Harun Rashid (early 9th century), the majority of Baghdad's population were Aramaic-speaking Christians, but the ruling class had adopted Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. Today, Aramaic exists only in small, isolated communities in Syria, northern Iraq, Lebanon, and Turkey, with some speakers also in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

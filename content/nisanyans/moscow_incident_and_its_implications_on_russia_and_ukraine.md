The recent incident in Moscow is described as a "tragic event" where "over 100,000 people" were killed, though a later clarification in the same discussion noted "100-odd people being killed like sacrificial lambs" and "so many people being injured" [00:00:36]. This event occurred in Moscow, a city known for its cultural activities [00:00:49].

## Analysis of the Incident

The immediate reaction, interpreting the incident as an "expression of hostility" fueled by hatred towards Russia, is deemed unconvincing given the magnitude of the operation [00:01:40]. Such an undertaking, requiring the mobilization of "tens or maybe hundreds of people," suggests intelligence involvement [00:02:12].

The speaker proposes that the incident is a "link in a chain of provocations" that have been recurring for approximately two years [00:02:31].

### Objectives of the Provocations
The primary aim of these provocations appears to be to force Russia to "react aggressively and in an angry way," thereby escalating the [[The Ukraine war and its impact on NATO and global alliances | Ukraine War]] [00:02:54]. It is anticipated that Russia would react disproportionately, possibly by destroying Kiev [00:03:08].

### Examples of Alleged Provocations
Similar incidents cited as part of this pattern include:
*   Bombings targeting civilians in the city of Belgium on Russia's border [00:03:35]. These are considered provocations, not having a military purpose [00:03:38].
*   Two attempted demolitions of the Crimean Bridge [00:03:48].
*   The bombing of an apartment building in Moscow by an unmanned aerial vehicle a few months prior [00:03:53].

The main motive behind these actions is to "escalate the war" and elicit an emotional reaction from Russia [00:04:22].

## Western Alliance's Position

The speaker questions who desires this escalation. The official approach of Western countries, including America and Western Europe, does not seem to be in this direction [00:04:48]. The Western alliance, according to the speaker, recognizes that the [[The Ukraine war and its impact on NATO and global alliances | Ukraine War]] is "lost" and has been "over for over a year, maybe since January 2023" [00:04:57]. Ukraine is seen as having "no way to win" [00:05:09].

The West's significant investment in the war—financially, industrially, and in military personnel—has not yielded the desired outcome, and "defeat is clearly at the door" [00:05:30].

### Western Fears
The primary concern for the West is a "sudden and massive attack" by Russia that would occupy Kiev, which would signify a "disaster for the Western alliance" [00:05:54]. Such an outcome would call into question the functionality and future of organizations like [[The Ukraine war and its impact on NATO and global alliances | NATO]] and the European Union [00:06:42]. A defeat for [[The Ukraine war and its impact on NATO and global alliances | NATO]] would lead global allies, particularly those of the United States, to question its power and trustworthiness [00:07:13]. Countries like Germany, Turkey, Australia, and India might review their foreign policies [00:07:43].

The West is "very afraid" of the war ending in a "collapse" [00:08:03].

### Western Strategy: Intimidation and Bluff
For over a year, Western policies have aimed to "intimidate Russia" [00:08:17]. An example is the widely announced Ukrainian counter-attack in the summer of 2023 [00:08:37]. This announcement, despite the need for surprise in a real counter-attack, served to dissuade Russia from launching a major offensive and to encourage it to strengthen its defensive positions [00:09:20].

More recently, major Western spokespeople have been making statements about preparing for a "Great World War," which the speaker views as "bluffing" rather than "real planning" [00:09:55]. The goal is to send the message: "Watch your step against Russia. Don't launch a major attack. Because you don't know what the consequences will be... we are crazy, we can do all kinds of crazy things and we will start a World War" [00:10:28].

### Fear of Western Alliance Collapse
In contrast to the 1980s and 1990s discourse about the collapse of the Soviet Union, the current situation presents the "collapse of the Western alliance" as a danger to the entire world, including Russia [00:11:39]. The Western alliance has been the "cornerstone of the diplomatic and military balances in the world for decades" [000:11:44].

### Desired Outcome for the West
The West's "expectations and hopes" are for the [[The Ukraine war and its impact on NATO and global alliances | Ukraine War]] to "drag on for a long time" without "serious incidents or much development" [00:12:05]. The aim is for public interest to wane, so that when the war eventually ends—even in Ukraine's defeat—"no one will care" or even notice [00:12:21].

The West does not want Russia to launch a "sudden and major attack and collapse Ukraine," and Russia "also sees this logic and accepts it up to a point" [00:12:53]. The current military balance suggests Russia could easily "gather like a ripe pear" Ukraine's military forces [00:13:06].

## Perpetrators of the Moscow Incident

If the logic of the Western desire for a prolonged, low-intensity conflict is correct, the Moscow incident becomes a "big question mark" [00:13:30]. While Western leaders like the NATO Secretary General, President of the European Council, and French President are signaling restraint to Russia, others might be trying to encourage Russia towards an "enterprising policy" [00:13:46].

The speaker dismisses ISIS as the perpetrator, calling the blame "ridiculous" and "absurd" [00:19:10]. The speaker suggests potential actors:
*   State institutions [00:14:54].
*   "Adventurous elements" growing in the gaps of overly large and uncontrollable state institutions [00:15:00].
*   One or more states within the Western alliance [00:15:16].
*   Organized forces in Ukraine that have "lost the ability to think rationally," likened to the Nazi Party administration in the last days of World War I [00:15:38]. There are "sounds of conflict" and "differences of opinion" within Ukraine [00:15:42].
*   Armed and military forces in Ukraine with "very different views on what the right policy is" [00:16:05].
*   Western "militia forces" and "organized armed people" who have joined the war in Ukraine [00:16:20]. These are described as "volunteer Akıncıs" (akin to Ottoman raiders) rather than mercenaries, seeking adventure, honor, or money [00:16:53]. The extent to which these groups act under government control versus independently is unknown [00:17:39].

### Disinformation and Public Thinking
The speaker notes that the quick and unanimous blaming of ISIS by Western governments fits a pattern of releasing "nonsense theories" and "slogans" that have a short lifespan, typically about a week, before another is introduced [00:19:24]. The purpose of this "propaganda" is not to convince, but to "destroy the public's ability to think rationally" by overwhelming them with inconsistent and often unbelievable lies [00:20:48]. This method aims to "confuse the mind" and prevent rational thought [00:22:09]. This tactic was observed intensely during the COVID-19 pandemic and the [[RussiaUkraine conflict and geopolitical analysis | Gaza War]] [00:21:18].

## Russia's Reaction
Despite the provocation, Putin's response on television was "very boring, very measured," indicating a strategic approach akin to "playing chess" while others might expect a more emotional "backgammon" response [00:22:57]. This suggests Russia is not reacting as emotionally as the provocateurs might intend.

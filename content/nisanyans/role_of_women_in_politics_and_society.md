The discussion surrounding the [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | cultural and societal roles of women]] and their involvement in [[politics_in_the_country | politics]] touches upon current political appointments, historical contexts, and broader societal trends.

## Women in Modern Politics

A recent cabinet announcement has been criticized for the limited number of women, with only one solid woman appointed and no other female cabinet members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. However, it is noted that for the first time in Turkey's history, a woman is set to be appointed to head the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

Globally, female cabinet members and heads of state have become "very fashionable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a> and are presented as a condition of modernity, democracy, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Despite this trend, there is skepticism regarding the performance of some contemporary female politicians. Examples cited include Nancy Pelosi, the Foreign Minister of Germany, the Prime Ministers of Finland, Estonia, and Moldova, the woman expelled in New Zealand, and the Foreign Minister of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. These individuals are described as "the worst and corrupt politicians in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, showing "such a level of stupidity, incompetence and indifference that it really becomes synonymous with treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

A key question posed is why women with strong character and competence do not seem to rise to prominence in global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Angela Merkel is mentioned as a rare example of a woman in a high position of power who possessed "a certain level of intelligence, mastery and personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

It is suggested that many women presented as politicians globally are a "political tragedy that came out of a counter and was mass-produced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This trend is interpreted as conveying a message: "We have established such an order that we bring them to the forefront and you eat them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, echoing Caligula's statement about electing his horse as a Senator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Similarly, "beautiful women who do not have any intellectual capacity and administrative skills" are sometimes brought to the forefront purely for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, as "they do not govern anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. The act of placing a "senile old man" or a "beautiful and empty woman" at the top of politics is deemed to have no difference in quality, as both are "selling images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

## Historical Context of Women's Roles

There is no historical evidence of truly matriarchal societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. While some societies might carry property or names through the mother's line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>, the general division of labor between men and women has remained largely similar across societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

In primitive and tribal societies, the distinction between women and men was less pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Women could undertake traditionally male functions, such as riding horses, fighting, and speaking fearlessly in assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This dynamic was observed in pre-Islamic Arab societies and in ancient Greek epics like the Iliad, where goddesses exhibited strong will and readiness to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. Similarly, in the primitive period of the Turks, before complex social structures and state organization, women played a more active societal role, as evidenced in the tales of Dede Korkut and in primitive Native American societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

With the advent of [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | civilization]], a stricter and more comprehensive division of labor emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This led to the professionalization of state, society, city, army, church, and religious management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>, along with the rise of complex written cultures and commercial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Historically, this development consistently resulted in the restriction of women's visible roles outside the home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. This trend was not limited to the advent of Islam but also occurred with Christianity, the Roman Empire, European colonialism in the Americas, and in countries like China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

The transition from primitive tribal societies to complex civilizations led to a separation of the public and household spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. While women might maintain dominance within the home, the public sphere became largely male-dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

However, this traditional structure proved unsustainable in the 20th and 21st centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>, and society is now moving into a new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Nevertheless, seeking solutions for contemporary needs in pre-Islamic or pre-civilization traditions is considered absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

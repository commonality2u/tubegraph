## Introduction to Religious Traditions and Historical Events

The celebration of Eid al-Adha is recognized as a social tradition that should be honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The speaker extends congratulations to both those who celebrate it and those who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Critiques of Religious Narratives and Belief

### The Narrative of Bar Abbas and Jesus
The historical account of the crucifixion of Jesus and the forgiveness of Bar Abbas is critically examined due to the absence of objective press or publications from that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. Instead of questioning why the forgiveness occurred, the speaker suggests it's more insightful to ask why people felt the need to recount such a story 100 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This highlights the subjective nature and potential evolution of [[comparison_of_religious_narratives_and_their_evolution | religious narratives]].

### The Concept of the "Death of God"
The idea of the "death of God" is seen as a secondary, derivative result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. The speaker argues that God and belief in God are serious, stemming from the dominance of religious rules and traditions in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. If society enthusiastically engages with religious stories and discussions, and adheres to practices like prayer, fasting, and Eid celebrations, then "God doesn't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. In the West, the Church's influence diminished first, followed by the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. This discussion relates to [[Philosophical discussions on morality and belief | philosophical discussions on morality and belief]].

### Turkey's Encounter with Westernization and Religion
Turkey's efforts at Westernization, particularly from the mid-19th century to the end of the 20th century, aimed to reduce the dominance of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>. However, this process failed to offer a convincing alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>. Turkey's reluctance to fully embrace Western institutions and moral laws led to a weak and feeble outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>. By the 21st century, the West itself had "died" as a model for an ideal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>. Consequently, a large portion of the Turkish populace reverted to Islam, their familiar alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. Kurds, conversely, turned to Kurdish nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:13">[01:50:13]</a>. This bankruptcy of the Western model resulted in a three-sided conflict: Turkish fanatic nationalism/fascism, Islamic piety, and Kurdish nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. Under these conditions, religion is unlikely to lose its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. This provides a [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | historical and philosophical perspective on religion]] within Turkey.

## The Nestorian Church: A Case Study in Religious History and Evolution

Nestorianism, derived from Nestorius, a Patriarch of Istanbul elected around 420-424 AD, was a religious movement centered on a significant philosophical debate about the personality of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

### Theological Dispute and Exile
Nestorius's views, concerning whether Jesus' human and divine personalities were the same or different, sparked a complex philosophical discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Initially perceived as nonsense, the debate revealed a sophisticated intellectual depth upon closer examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. Despite its intellectual complexity, the speaker considers all philosophical discussions to be "empty-based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

Nestorius was exiled to a monastery in the Egyptian desert and subsequently killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. However, his movement, Nestorianism, persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

### Council of Ephesus and Persecution
In 431 AD, a major church council in Ephesus condemned Nestorianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. Despite this, the movement remained influential, especially in the eastern provinces, particularly in Urfa and other Syrian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. Around the 450s, a harsher period of oppression began, leading to the prosecution and arrest of many Nestorian clergy and thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. This persecution led many to flee across the border to Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

### Migration and Cultural Centers
The significant school in Urfa, a madrasah, saw all its teachers relocate to Nusaybin, which was then part of Iran, establishing the Nusaybin school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. This became a vital cultural center for 500-600 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

### Official Adoption in the Iranian Empire
Within the Iranian Empire, the Christian Church community in Baghdad later adopted Nestorianism as its official doctrine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Around 470 or 480 AD, Nestorian Christianity was effectively adopted as the second official religion across Iranian cities, with Nestorian bishoprics established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>. While Zoroastrianism remained the state religion, Christianity became dominant in the most fertile and populous regions like present-day Iraq and Mesopotamia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>. The Iranian state preferred Nestorianism as an alternative to Byzantine Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. This represents a significant [[comparative_analysis_of_state_religions_and_ideologies_in_ancient_empires | comparative analysis of state religions and ideologies in ancient empires]].

### Spread and Later Divisions
Nestorian clergy from Iran established important Christian communities in Central Asia and India, particularly the state of Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>, where a large group with a history of this past remains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. In contrast, Armenia, a problematic neighbor and province of Iran, resisted Nestorianism due to terror of massacres and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

After the arrival of Islam, the Nestorian Church maintained a significant presence in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. During the Abbasid period, Nestorianism was influential in state administration and intellectual fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. However, after the Mongol invasions in the 1200s, Nestorians in the Islamic world were largely crushed; survivors either converted to Islam or fled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

By 1300, the patriarch of Baghdad moved to Mosul and then to an inaccessible village in the Hakkari principality, like Kuşhanis Village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. At the end of the 15th century, a part of the Nestorian community submitted to the Catholic Church, accepting the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. By the early 1600s, internal conflict led to a split: those who cut ties with the Catholic world remained Nestorians (or Assyrians), primarily in the mountainous regions of Hakkari and Northern Iraq, while those who remained Catholic were called the Chaldean Church, primarily in cities like Mosul, Siirt, and Kirkuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>. These two groups became distinct sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>.

### Nestorian Presence in Hakkari
Until the early 20th century, the Nestorians were a powerful and independent element within the Hakkari principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. This principality, based in mountainous areas like Çukurca and the Tiyari and Takuma Valleys, had an independent state-like existence, nominally respecting the Ottomans or the Shah of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. Nestorians were independent tribes, recognizing the Hakkari bey but managing their internal affairs and collecting their own taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.

A significant Kurdish-subject Nestorian population in Hakkari villages and towns spoke Kurdish daily but performed church services in the Eastern dialect of Old Syriac, making them bilingual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. The Chaldeans, in contrast, were a more settled, urban population in the plains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>. The geographical distribution of Nestorians in the Ottoman Empire largely mirrored the old Iranian Empire's border, east of the Tigris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.

### Decline and Disappearance in Turkey
During World War I, Nestorians were largely destroyed in Turkey; some fled to Northern Iraq (under English rule) and others were massacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. The Hakkari Nestorians were notably attacked twice in 1846 and 1849 by Nurullah Bey, the Hakkari bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>. In 1915, upon state instructions, Kurdish tribes burned or expelled the Nestorian population in regions like Dağlıca and Oramar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>. Many became refugees in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

After the British took over Iraq, Nestorians migrated there in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>. Some returned to Hakkari in 1919, but in 1924, the Republic of Turkey militarily eliminated or deported all of them within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. This ended the 1500-1600 year Nestorian and Chaldean presence in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.

Currently, a small Nestorian community continues its leadership in a suburb of Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>. The speaker reflects on the profound loss of this history, noting that locals today might mistake a historical Nestorian cathedral as an "Armenian Church" due to a lack of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>. This demonstrates the societal impact of the loss of [[the_role_of_historical_narratives_in_contemporary_society | historical narratives]].

### Comparison to Switzerland
The speaker discusses a question about Hakkari potentially becoming like Switzerland in the future. They note that 500 years ago, Switzerland was the poorest, most underdeveloped, and tribal country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, analogous to Hakkari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>. This comparison, in the context of Hakkari's history, highlights the potential for dramatic [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | societal transformations]].

## Modern Religious and Social Events

### Quran Burning Protest in Sweden
A recent Quran burning protest in Sweden is seen as serving a clear purpose: eliminating Turkey's chance of approving Sweden's NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>. Turkey cannot approve it due to strong reaction expected from the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>. The speaker speculates that Russia or Turkey might have organized this event to achieve this political outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a>. Preventing Sweden's NATO membership is considered an important task for humanity, as it is seen as an "invitation to war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>. The speaker also suggests that elements within the Swedish state might have organized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:03">[01:46:03]</a>. This event is discussed as a modern [[social_and_political_comments_on_historical_and_modern_issues | social and political issue]] with religious implications.

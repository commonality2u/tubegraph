## İsmet İnönü's Leadership During WWII

İsmet İnönü is characterized as a manager without a grand vision, who was not a megalomaniac and had minimal ideological obsessions by the standards of his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He maintained a distance from Turkism movements that proliferated after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. His actions, like breaking the pro-Nazi structure in [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | Turkey]] with the 1942 arrests, intensified the animosity of Turkists towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. After 1942, Turkism emerged as the primary [[turkish_politics_and_elections | cleavage line]] in [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Approach to Governance and Reforms
İnönü shared the values of the revolutionary regime but prioritized stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While he played a key role in the violent suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion, he adopted a more moderate stance during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. His disagreement with Atatürk on the Dersim issue led to his dismissal from office and "political death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Unlike Atatürk, İnönü's interest in Western culture and law was sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He actively promoted classical music, which he developed a love for in Yemen, and worked to share this passion with the people of Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Upon assuming leadership, İnönü implemented one of the most comprehensive and courageous amnesty rights in the Republic's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In 1938, Atatürk's picture was removed from currency and other public places, possibly as a step to erase the excesses of a 15-year period of power intoxication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Inönü's economic policies during his early leadership were cautious and conservative due to his understanding of the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This led to accusations of being strict or cowardly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, after 1946, with the opening of credit lines from the United States, he initiated policies for rapid economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. He avoided flashy symbolic reforms, possibly due to World War II, and instead focused on real agricultural revolutions, such as cultivating tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. He also undertook significant public health initiatives like the eradication of Menemen and malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

He aimed to replace the "Kuvayi Milliye" (nationalist gang members) who surrounded his predecessor with young, educated cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The establishment of Village Institutes, supported by figures like Hasan Ali Yücel and İsmail Tonguç, occurred during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Land reform projects in Urfa and the Aegean region were also initiated under his administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Turkey's Neutrality in World War II

One of İnönü's most significant achievements was keeping [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] out of the disaster of the two World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The Turkish army's condition in 1940 was described as "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Entering the war on the side of the Allies would have been a liability for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The devastating consequences for countries like Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which fought and were defeated, illustrate the wisdom of Turkey's neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. It's difficult to imagine what would have happened if [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] had entered the war on Germany's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

### Public Hardship During Wartime
During the war years, the Turkish population experienced significant hardship, including bread rationing and forced labor for peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Military and gendarmerie pressure was also prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. However, these hardships were considered minor compared to the suffering endured by people in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

### The Contrast with WWI
Despite severe losses, hunger, and epidemics during World War I, that conflict is often remembered with "good intentions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. In contrast, the administrators of World War II, which was managed with ration cards, became subjects of hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. This difference in perception is attributed to the "plunder and tremendous wealth transfer" that occurred during WWI, enriching some segments of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. The genocide and plunder policies of the Union and Progress regime during WWI, where children were slaughtered and property seized, may have shaped popular attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

### Wartime Policies and Non-Muslims
In 1942, measures like the Wealth Tax and conscription were implemented, which implicitly led to plunder. By 1942, there was little left to plunder from the non-Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. The Turkish government took the majority of the non-Muslim male population to concentration camps twice in two years, releasing them months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. This was considered "strange behavior" by the standards of the two World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

Earlier, in 1934, a policy was implemented to expel the Jewish population from western [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]], outside of Istanbul, to create a buffer zone against potential German aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. This was done through mob attacks, breaking shops, marking houses, and state inaction or even encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Similarly, surviving Armenian communities in Anatolia were "purified" and encouraged to move to Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. This policy of concentrating the non-Muslim population in Istanbul reflected a mix of racism, stupidity, and perceived state necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

## Post-War Political Landscape

### İnönü's Transition to Multi-Party Politics
İnönü's career after 1950 saw him become the first, and possibly only, National Chief to voluntarily relinquish power after an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. He then shrank his influence after the 1950 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

### The 1960 Coup and İnönü's Role
The 1960s saw a strong movement towards a Nasserist-style regime under figures like Alparslan Türkeş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. A few months after the coup, İnönü played a significant role in braking this radical direction through an internal coup, steering towards a softer, "half-baked" democracy or a transition program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. However, his later political actions, including struggles with Demirel, support for military sentences in 1971, and resistance to Ecevit's rise in 1973, damaged his reputation and contributed to the ongoing deadlock in [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

Inönü sided with the moderate faction within the army following the 1960 coup, which aimed for a clean-up and a return to multi-party order aligned with NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. This led to the purging of radical revolutionary officers from the National Unity Committee in October 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>. For the next decade, factions within the army repeatedly attempted coups and formed secret political organizations, keeping [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]] on edge until the 1980 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:21">[01:52:21]</a>.

### The Atatürk Cult Post-1950
The "cult of the founder God" which continued after 1950, and especially after 1960, spread with "worse fury than before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.
After Atatürk's death in 1938, there was an effort to gradually erase his image and influence, removing his picture from money and textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:23">[01:41:23]</a>. His body was kept in the basement of the Ethnography Museum for 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>, as [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] tried to distance itself from the Soviet Union's Lenin and Stalin cults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>.

However, the Atatürk cult was "resurrected" in 1950, during the İnönü period, by the Democrat Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>. This included the enactment of an Atatürk protection law, prohibiting insult to his memory, and the revival of the Anıtkabir project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. Busts of Atatürk were placed in all provinces and government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:26">[01:43:26]</a>. This systematic policy in 1950 was likely a political decision during a risky transition from a single-party dictatorship to a democratic election period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. It was an agreement between the Republican People's Party and the Democrat Party to make the cult of Atatürk the "only unquestionable truth" and a "national unity" mortar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>. While strong in the early Democrat Party years, this mortar gradually weakened towards the end of the 1950s, only to be forcefully re-imposed by the military after the 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:14">[01:47:14]</a>.

### Greek Exile of 1963-64
The exile of Greeks from Istanbul in December 1963, often linked to the Cyprus issue, was a response to conflicts between the two communities in Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. Approximately 50,000 Greek passport holders in Istanbul were expelled within a week, losing their belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:29">[02:28:29]</a>. This was not a retaliation to the 1955 Istanbul pogrom, but a separate event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:45">[02:29:45]</a>. The Greek population of Istanbul remained in [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | Turkey]] after the Treaty of Lausanne because their departure would have caused the Turkish economy to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:20">[02:31:20]</a>. An agreement in 1935 allowed Istanbul Greeks to obtain Greek citizenship, offering conveniences like sending children to universities in Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>. In return, the Turks in Western Thrace were promised to be untouched by Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>. The 1963-64 expulsions thus ruptured this historical balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:56">[02:32:56]</a>.

Alevism is a distinct religious and cultural identity in Turkey, historically characterized by its divergence from mainstream Sunni Islam and its experience of continuous state oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. It is a very closed society, making it sensitive for outsiders to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Historical Origins of Alevism

[[historical_origins_of_alevism | Alevism]] as it is known today largely crystallized between the 1400s and 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This period saw the rise of the Safavid dynasty in Ardabil, Iran, under leaders like Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and Shah Ismail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. They initiated a significant revolutionary and protest movement against classical Islam and Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This religious reform movement interestingly coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The movement grew to such an extent that it threatened the Ottoman Empire, particularly during the reigns of Sultan Bayezid II and Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While the Alevi movement as a defined entity emerged around this time, it drew from earlier roots, including rebellions in Anatolia in the 1200s, such as those led by Baba Ishak and Baba Ilyas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Remnants of movements like Hurufism and Batinism also influenced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A significant factor was the unrest among newly and sometimes forcibly converted Muslims in Anatolia, who formed large groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This led to a broad rebellion that encompassed various resistance centers and quickly spread across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The Ottoman state perceived this movement as a mortal ideological threat and ruthlessly suppressed Alevism for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They declared Alevis illegal, killed them, and exiled them to mountainous regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This oppression continued into the 19th century, particularly during the suppression of the Janissary Corps, which also led to violent persecution of Alevis and Bektashis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Consequently, Alevis have never had good relations with the state, living illegally, hiding their identity, and worshipping secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Core Beliefs and Practices

The fundamental characteristic of Alevism is its resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law (Sharia), and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Alevis reject many basic tenets of mainstream Islam:
*   They do not observe the traditional fast, or perform a different type of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   They reject Sharia rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   They do not perform the pilgrimage (Hajj) or pay zakat (charity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Despite rejecting these core Islamic practices, Alevis define themselves as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Their self-definition centers on being supporters of Ahl al-Bayt (the family of Prophet Muhammad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. They believe the first four caliphs, except Ali, were illegitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. They consider Ali to be the true caliph of Muhammad, followed by the Twelve Imams from his lineage, including Hasan and Husayn, whose leadership they accept as the true representation of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Comparison with Shiism

While Alevism shares roots with Shiism (a party that existed within Islam since the 7th century), the Shah Ismail movement created a "brand new incident" and a distinct political constellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. When Shah Ismail became king of Iran, Iranian Shiism developed a strong madrasah tradition, academic framework, and mullah hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. In contrast, Alevis in Turkey, due to fear of the Ottoman state and Iran, developed a different tradition without such a central academic or hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This decentralized nature, resembling Protestantism compared to the "Catholic Church" of Shiism, relies on local *dedes* (spiritual leaders) who continue shamanic and ancient traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Diversity within Alevi Communities

[[differences_between_various_alevi_communities | Alevism]] is an eclectic movement, incorporating diverse elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. It brought together groups in Anatolia who, for various reasons, were not aligned with mainstream Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Its geographical spread includes:
*   A triangle-shaped region of Sivas (especially Divriği-Kangal districts), Tunceli-Erzincan, parts of Tokat and Amasya, extending south to the metropolitan area of Malatya and Maraş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   A significant Kurdish Alevi population west of the Euphrates, in areas like Malatya, Sivas, and Erzincan, which were largely cleared of Alevis east of the Euphrates after massacres around 1500-1514 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   An Arab Alevi population (Nusayris) in Antakya and Hatay, whose traditions, worship, and beliefs are distinct from other Alevis and share similarities with Arab Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Alevi populations in Albania (especially the southern, Orthodox-influenced part) and the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Alevis are ethnically diverse:
*   Approximately half of Alevis in Turkey are of Turkish origin, strongly identifying with Turkmen and Central Asian heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   About 40% are of Kurdish origin, speaking Kurdish, and do not identify as Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
*   Nusayris in Hatay have no connection to Turkishness, being closer culturally to Arab Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Tahtacıs**: Forest villagers found in the coastal mountains from Antalya to Çanakkale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. They have a nomadic history, distinct culture, and historically little harmony with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. They are considered Alevi but are distinct from other Alevis and often vote for the MHP (Nationalist Movement Party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Abdals**: Found in Central Anatolia, especially south of Gaziantep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. They are a professional social group associated with music and entertainment, often considered similar to Romani people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. They also exhibit anti-state sentiments and do not take Muslims seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

Alevism's unique character stems from its absorption of various traditions, including elements from Central Asian Turkish traditions, Christianity (evident in the Ali figure resembling Jesus and ceremonies resembling Easter), and old Kurdish traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

## Cultural Evolution and Political Landscape

The [[cultural_evolution_of_alevi_society | cultural evolution of Alevi society]] has been shaped by its history of being a marginalized group. The common theme uniting diverse Alevi communities is their opposition to the state and the dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This "anti-state" stance meant they often fled to remote mountainous regions to avoid Ottoman authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

The [[relationship_between_alevism_and_turkish_identity | relationship between Alevism and Turkish identity]] is complex. While some Alevis identify strongly with Turkish heritage, others (Kurdish, Arab) do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.

### Alevism as a Rebellion Movement

[[alevism_as_a_rebellion_movement | Alevism]] represents a significant rebellion against the state and religious orthodoxy. There is a strong, radical state hostility tradition among Alevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

### Political Affiliations and Kemalism

Despite centuries of conflict with the state, a significant portion of Alevis today vote for the CHP (Republican People's Party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Their primary and long-standing "enemy" for 500 years has been the Sunni Islamic establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. In the context of a Sunni-dominated state, [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Kemalism]] and secularism, symbolized by Atatürk, offered Alevis a perceived space within the state for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. This allows them to assert their right to participate in state institutions, holding positions as civil servants, police, or generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Kemalism is currently seen as their primary political anchor against religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.

However, Kemalism is viewed by some as a "dead end" for Alevis because it is a minority political ideology in Turkey, doomed to defeat in a democratic system where the majority favors Islamic ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

### Influence on Turkish Leftist Movements

In the 1960s, Alevis briefly engaged with moderate right-wing politics, but after disappointment, they rapidly shifted towards the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. By the 1970s, Alevis overwhelmingly moved to the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. A significant portion, estimated at 90%, of the revolutionary youth movement in Turkey during the 1970s came from the Alevi community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

The [[influence_of_alevism_on_turkish_leftist_movements | Alevi culture]] profoundly shaped the leftist movement in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. This influence is visible in the leftist tradition's folk songs, fashion, and social dynamics, leading to the bağlama (a stringed instrument) and Alevi breath (spiritual folk music) becoming symbols of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. A key defining characteristic of the Turkish left is its strong anti-Muslim stance, reflecting the Alevi emphasis on resistance to the dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

Alevis in modern Turkey often manage to protect themselves from ideological aggression of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. While many modern Alevis may not actively practice Alevism, their family upbringing often instills a critical attitude towards official state narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. However, the Turkish state has a history of successful assimilation, which raises questions about how many generations this distinct identity can endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

The speaker reflects on their personal journey of exile from [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Türkiye]], marking significant milestones and challenges faced over seven years.

## Seven Years in Exile

On July 14th, the speaker commemorates the seventh anniversary of their departure from prison and [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This event was announced with a message titled "Bird Flown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The speaker admits they "didn't expect it to be this long and this difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Initial Hopes and Subsequent Challenges

The initial phase of exile, starting in Samosd, was described as "quite exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, with the prospect of establishing a new life and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This new initiative "seemed exciting" and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, a "second blow" came from the Greek police, leading to what felt like "a second exile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The subsequent two and a half years have been particularly "tiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, as "being an exile is not an easy thing, it's a difficult art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## A Silver Lining

Amidst the challenges, the speaker highlights one "only advantage [or] beauty of this whole process": meeting their wife, Iray, who "saves the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Reflections

The speaker notes that July 14th also symbolizes the French Revolution and the Bastille incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, when the prison was captured, the governor killed, and prisoners released in 1789 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This historical context of liberation and radical change serves as a backdrop to their personal experience of leaving confinement.

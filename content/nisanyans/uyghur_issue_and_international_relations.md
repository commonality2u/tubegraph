## Uyghur Issue and International Relations

The **Uyghur issue** has been discussed from various perspectives, particularly concerning its origins and international implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. The speaker states that they have thoroughly read the arguments and theses from both sides of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

### Origin of the "Uyghur Genocide Theory"

The speaker asserts that the "Uyghur massacre" or "Uyghur genocide theory" originated in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. They describe it as propaganda systematically disseminated by the [[American and Chinese Geopolitical Tensions | American State Department]] and the CIA, stemming from specific individuals and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

It is claimed that in the early 2000s, the Americans attempted to provoke the Uyghurs, establishing an organization that led to the emergence of Uyghur Islamic jihadists in Uyghuristan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. According to the speaker, [[Turkish Political Transformation and International Relations | TÃ¼rkiye]] also supported this project at the time, providing logistical assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

The speaker's understanding of the situation is partly informed by their first American wife, who worked at the Uyghur desk of the International Amnesty Organization, eventually becoming its manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. This wife reportedly developed a strong dislike for the organization and left her position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

The goal behind the organization among the Uyghurs was to establish [[American and Chinese Geopolitical Tensions | American]] and NATO dominance in [[Central Asianism and its impact on Turkish national identity | Central Asia]] after Afghanistan, aiming to weaken [[geopolitical_issues_involving_united_states_china_and_taiwan | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

### China's Response and Policy

In response to these perceived threats, [[geopolitical_issues_involving_united_states_china_and_taiwan | China]] implemented a very clear and strong policy, putting heavy pressure on individuals and organizations connected to these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. This involved taking people to re-education camps, where they were reportedly "annoyed" but not severely beaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

The speaker observes that [[geopolitical_issues_involving_united_states_china_and_taiwan | China]] does not have a negative policy towards the Uyghur nation or people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Uyghurs hold various positions across [[geopolitical_issues_involving_united_states_china_and_taiwan | China]], and their culture is appreciated on a folkloric level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The Uyghur Xinjiang province continues to develop and prosper rapidly, with Uyghur Muslims, a minority, sharing in this prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

It is believed that the re-education camps are largely closed, with very few remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. The speaker concludes that [[geopolitical_issues_involving_united_states_china_and_taiwan | China]] has successfully eliminated the "scourge" brought upon them by the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Opinion on the Term "Genocide"

The speaker finds it objectionable and wrong to empty the word "genocide" of its despicable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Speaker's View
> During this period of alleged oppression, the speaker states that Uyghurs were not killed, destroyed, exiled from their countries, or deprived of their property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Instead, their freedoms were restricted to a certain extent, and their organizational structures were dismantled, which the speaker views as a "successful police operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. They find those who transformed this issue into a propaganda tool to be incredibly hypocritical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

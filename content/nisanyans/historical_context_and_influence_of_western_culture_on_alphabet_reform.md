The **Alphabet Revolution** in [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | Türkiye]] and the Language Revolution are distinct historical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The alphabet reform occurred in 1927-1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, while the Language Revolution commenced in 1932 and reached its peak in 1935 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. There is a four to five-year difference between these two initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Necessity and Early Reform Attempts

The alphabet reform, sometimes referred to as the "mortar revolution" (likely a transcription error for alphabet revolution in context), became a [[necessity_of_the_alphabet_revolution | necessity]] starting from the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Most discerning individuals in [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Türkiye]] increasingly viewed a writing revolution as a prerequisite for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

During the First Constitutional Era (1908-1917/1918), the Ottoman ruling classes explored various ideas for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Proposals included:
*   Radically reforming the [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] to become a fully alphabetic script, explicitly expressing all vowels and consonants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   Transforming Arabic letters to be separate and independent, akin to Latin alphabet characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Cultural Transformation and Western Influence

From approximately 1850 onwards, and possibly even earlier, the cultural landscape of [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Türkiye's]] ruling, cultured, and educated classes underwent a complete transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Their horizons shifted, with the West becoming their primary point of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

This pervasive [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western influence]] manifested in various ways:
*   New ideas, especially in politics and law, originated from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   Affluent families sent their children to Western cities like Geneva, Paris, and London for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   Western literary forms, clothing fashions, scientific developments, journalistic styles, and article writing methods were imitated and adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

This process made the adoption of a Western-style alphabet "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Challenges with the Arabic Alphabet and Justifications for Change

The [[challenges_with_the_arabic_alphabet | Arabic alphabet]] presented significant problems for writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. While these issues were not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, the Latin alphabet, as adopted in [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | Türkiye]], is considered a more advanced script, better suited for expressing fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

A critical issue was the difficulty of writing non-native words in Turkish correctly using the [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Attempts to transliterate foreign words that didn't align with Turkish and Arabic sound structures led to "absurd results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. For instance, in old maps and tax records, it is challenging to determine the correct pronunciation of over half the place names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Debunked Arguments

Two primary arguments historically put forth regarding the alphabet revolution are considered baseless:
1.  **Increased literacy:** It was claimed that the alphabet reform increased literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, this claim lacks logical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. For example, Iran maintained the [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] for Persian, despite it being a "foreign alphabet" for Persian sounds, yet Iran's literacy rate is comparable to or even higher than [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | Türkiye's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Similarly, Israel achieved high literacy rates by imposing the Hebrew alphabet, which shares structural similarities with the Arabic alphabet, despite most Jews not knowing it traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Therefore, the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | Alphabet Revolution in Türkiye]] likely did not significantly contribute to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Aiding Westernization:** The claim that the alphabet reform significantly "helped westernization" is also largely untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. However, it was a strong cultural pressure that became inevitable when the country's cultural structure and orientation shifted towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## The Threat of Non-Muslim Alphabets

Another crucial factor in the alphabet revolution was the burgeoning publication in Turkish using Armenian and Greek letters starting from the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   Many Turkish novels and newspapers were published in Armenian letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   Turkish newspapers, including news, international updates, stock market information, jokes, and poems, were also printed in Greek letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

Increasingly, some Turkish Muslims preferred reading these publications over those in [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic letters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. They even learned the Armenian alphabet to access Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This was because both the Armenian and Greek alphabets were significantly more effective and straightforward than the old [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] in expressing the nuances of spoken Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

With rising literacy, there was a real possibility of a large shift towards Armenian and Greek alphabets in [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Preventing this shift was difficult with the [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, making the alphabet revolution an "inevitable development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

The Language Revolution, which aimed to eliminate all Arabic and Persian words from Turkish, was a separate and distinct "madness" that began a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

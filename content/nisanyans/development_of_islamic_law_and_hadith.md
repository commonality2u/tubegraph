Islamic law and the compilation of Hadith emerged as foundational elements of the Islamic State, transitioning from a military operation into a structured empire requiring a comprehensive legal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. This development sought to establish a system of governance and societal norms based on religious principles, influenced by existing legal traditions and asserting the autonomy of law from state authority.

## Historical Context: From Military Operation to Legal System

The Islamic State began as a tribal gang and developed through a conquest movement, leading to a period of intense internal conflict and massacres after the Prophet's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Upon reaching a stable plateau during the Umayyad era, the empire felt the need to establish a legal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. The question arose: how would daily life, including issues like returning borrowed goods, be managed with Islam as the reference? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>

Intelligent and sophisticated individuals recognized that by systematically analyzing narratives about the time of Prophet Muhammad, a vast legal system could be incrementally established, separating realistic accounts from unrealistic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. This endeavor resulted in what is known as Hadith, which is more than just mythological stories; it is a legal system built upon these narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. This [[religious_influence_on_laws_and_modernization | legal system]] is considered one of the few original legal sources in world history, alongside ancient Roman law and English customary law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

## The Rise of Hadith as a Legal Source

Around 800-850 AD, during the peak of the Abbasid State, the science of Hadith emerged as a widespread social phenomenon across the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. This period saw countless compilations of Hadith, which are accounts of the Prophet's words and actions, often attributed through a chain of narrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.

### Bukhari's Prominence

Among these compilations, six were recognized as reference works in the Sunni tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. While these compilations often overlapped, Bukhari's compilation became the most famous, largest, and most authoritative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Initially, around 840 AD (during the time of Caliph Mutasim or Mutawakkil), Bukhari's work was accepted as a respectable academic reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Over time, it gained a sanctity that could almost rival the [[historical_and_religious_context_of_quran_writing | Quran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. At its inception, Bukhari's Hadith was seen as the result of "very good research" by one of many quarreling scholars in Baghdad, renowned for its quality and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

## Influences on Islamic Law: The Jewish Tradition (Talmud)

A significant influence on the development of Islamic law was the [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Jewish tradition]], particularly the Talmud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. The Talmud, a vast collection of legal precedents and Torah interpretations, developed over approximately 500 years, from the time of Christ to 500-600 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. It is characterized by its dialectical system, where religious scholars engage in discussions and interpretations, forming layers of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. Key centers for the Talmudic tradition included Tiberias (near modern-day Baghdad), which was known to the jurists and scholars in Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. These Islamic scholars were heavily influenced by this tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## Autonomy of Law and the Role of Jurists

A crucial aspect of Islamic law's development, especially in the 9th century, was the effort to establish the autonomy of the legal field against state authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. While the Caliph held power in military and taxation matters, the resolution of disputes between individuals was considered outside the state's direct legal jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

Judges and scholars (jurists) formed a distinct class whose authority derived from religion, not from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. They established an "extraordinarily complex labyrinth of knowledge" to prevent the head of state from interfering in legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. This concern for legal autonomy also underlies the science of Hadith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

## Sophistication of the Hadith System

The Hadith system is highly sophisticated and rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. To understand and express an opinion within it, one needs to have memorized the sciences of `tabakat` and `sikat` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. These sciences involve the life stories of tens of thousands of people who transmitted the Prophet Muhammad's words and actions, verifying the authenticity and meaning of the transmissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. This intricate knowledge empowered jurists to assert their authority against rulers, stating that legal matters were outside the ruler's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>.

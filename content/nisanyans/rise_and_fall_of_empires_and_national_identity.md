This article explores the historical evolution of states and the concept of national identity, particularly focusing on the rise of modern nationalism and its impact on multi-ethnic empires like the Ottoman Empire, and the subsequent decline of nationalism in the 21st century.

## The Historical Context of States

Before the late 18th century, states were fundamentally different from modern nation-states. The idea of establishing states based on nationality is a very modern concept, primarily emerging after the French Revolution [00:10:53].

Historically, various types of states existed:
*   **City-States** In entities comprising a city and its controlled provincial area, there was an extremely strong sense of solidarity [00:11:23]. Citizens felt "this city is ours" and gathered in assemblies to make decisions, even sacrificing themselves for the city's honor [00:11:32]. Examples of intermediate forms included the Swiss Confederation and the Dutch Confederation [00:12:01].
*   **Dynastic Loyalty** Serious states and kingdoms were not based on a sense of nation [00:12:17]. Instead, they centered on a sovereign dynasty, where loyalty to the dynasty was an extremely strong feeling [00:12:26]. People believed they earned their livelihood thanks to the dynasty and would sacrifice their lives for it if necessary [00:12:34]. Religious identity also played a role [00:12:41]. However, a great state based on nationality, like France, England, or the Ottoman Empire, did not exist under this model [00:12:46].

## The Rise of Modern Nationalism

The shift towards [[historical_roots_and_impacts_of_nationalism | modern nationalism]] began in 1792 [01:13:14], with the revolutionary regime in France [01:17:17]. When European states united against France, the French State introduced compulsory military service [01:13:46]. This was a radical innovation, as it was the first time in European history that every citizen was obliged to join the army upon the state's call [01:13:56].

Before this, military service was primarily for professional soldiers [01:14:12] or the ruling noble elites [01:14:48]. The recruitment of ordinary people into the military was a brand new event [01:14:57]. For a farmer, baker, or shoemaker to become a soldier, they had to feel that the state was "their state," that "our state is ours," and that "we are equal to the state" [01:15:29]. This required the governing cadres to portray themselves as representing the people, an idea the speaker describes as a "fraud" but necessary for people to join the military [01:15:47].

This new model, combining the Republic, compulsory military service, and the [[the_role_of_language_in_national_identity | nation feeling]], meant that "we, our nation, govern themselves as a subject" [01:16:11]. The state was presented as the institutionalized expression of the people, synonymous with the nation [01:17:06]. This concept spread rapidly from the early 1800s, influencing countries like Spain and Germany [01:17:20].

In Germany, German romantics began demanding a new state built on the German nation, as Germany was then a mosaic of over 300 independent kingdoms, principalities, duchies, and city-states [01:17:33]. The success of Napoleon's army, built on compulsory military service, forced Prussia and other German principalities to adopt similar systems [01:18:31].

## Nationalism and Empires: The Ottoman Experience

The Ottoman Empire, a multi-ethnic state, also adopted compulsory military service, albeit later, around 1824-1826 during the time of Mahmud II [01:19:00]. This was a significant shift from the previous system where military service was a professional, income-generating profession, as exemplified by the Janissaries [01:34:02]. Professional soldiers also enjoyed tax exemptions [01:35:04]. By the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire struggled to maintain a large empire-wide military institution, relying instead on regional armies and local emirs [01:35:16].

The introduction of compulsory military service in the Ottoman Empire had unforeseen consequences:
*   **Rise of Minority Nationalisms** In multi-ethnic societies, the concept that the state belonged to a "dominant nation" led minority societies to question their loyalty [02:11:09]. They began to argue that if the state was primarily for the dominant nation, then "this is not our country" [02:22:58], leading to demands for their own states [02:22:02]. This was a "typical disease of the 19th and 20th centuries" [02:22:02].
*   **Collapse of the Ottoman Empire** This period coincided with the fragmentation of the Ottoman Empire [02:26:26], as groups like the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Arabs, and Armenians sought to establish their own national states [02:26:30]. This process is connected to [[comparison_of_ottoman_empires_collapse_with_other_empires | other empires]].
*   **Economic Impact and Plunder** According to Islamic law, non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire were forbidden from carrying weapons [02:37:01]. When compulsory military service was introduced for Muslims, non-Muslims were required to pay a large fee to be exempt [02:38:45]. This meant that while Muslim peasants were impoverished by constant military service, non-Muslims were compelled to engage in income-generating activities to afford the exemption [02:38:51]. This economic disparity, coupled with the exploitation of Turks by the Ottoman state, led to the plunder of wealthy non-Muslims [02:41:57]. The wealth of figures like Vehbi Koç, Sakıp Sabancı, and Eczacıbaşı is linked to the confiscated properties of Armenian and other non-Muslim communities in cities like Ankara, Adana, and İzmir [02:39:09]. This is viewed as a "human tragedy," a "chain reaction of stupid results" stemming from the Ottoman Empire's policies [02:43:29].

## The Decline of Nationalism in the 21st Century

Compulsory general military service has been disappearing globally over the last 10-20 years [02:29:29]. In many Western countries, it no longer exists as a serious life-altering event [02:33:51]. Military service is increasingly becoming a professional occupation requiring technical expertise [02:44:45]. This shift means that soldiers are not necessarily attached to the state with a deep sense of loyalty or belonging, but rather see it as a profession or a source of economic benefit [02:51:11].

Under these conditions, the sense of [[nationalism_and_its_global_consequences | nationalism]], encapsulated as "We are from such and such a nation, therefore we are loyal to this state, we will give our lives for this state if necessary," is rapidly deteriorating [02:53:30]. While a "soldier nation" sentiment still exists in some countries like Türkiye, it is fading among the well-off and educated [02:26:18]. In Western societies, the idea of sacrificing one's life for the homeland has become an "absurd idea" with no credibility [02:48:48]. This suggests that the feeling of belonging to a nation with political ties has also been diminished [02:59:03].

The speaker speculates that in an era where conflicts are intense and control is lost, the future might see the rise of "strong core organizations based on force of arms," such as mafias, whose members are loyal to each other [03:04:41]. This is already observable in Latin America [03:01:09].

## Notable Figures and Concepts

*   **Eğil:** The ancestral hometown of a friend's family, Eğil, in Diyarbakır, Türkiye, is noted for its ancient history. Its real name, "Agl," is a Syriac (Aramaic) word [00:06:51]. It served as a strategic position connecting the Mesopotamian plains to the Taurus Mountains [00:08:00]. Its earliest known founders, from centuries before Christ, spoke Aramaic [00:08:21]. Kurdish Mirs later established a principality there, ruling independently until the 19th century [00:09:14].
*   **Mehmet Ali Pasha (of Egypt):** Considered by the speaker to be the person who "served Turkishness the most in modern history" [00:43:40]. Despite being Albanian by heritage [00:44:11], Mehmet Ali Pasha established the new Egyptian state [00:45:31]. The ruling classes of this newly established Egyptian state spoke Turkish throughout the 19th and into the mid-20th century [00:46:41]. Turkish became the elite and administrative language of Egypt until Gamal Abdel Nasser's regime in the 1950s [00:48:05]. Mehmet Ali Pasha's influence significantly expanded the spread of the Turkish language as a language of elite and administration [00:48:31].

### Reflection on Leadership

A leader's primary aim is to protect and increase their own power [01:42:37]. Leaders make concessions, offer rewards, or instill fear in the populace based on what they believe will best serve this goal [01:13:00]. Politics is likened to a game where those who make the most unexpected and unpredictable moves, coupled with luck, often win [01:15:06]. The 16th-century French political thinker Jean Bodin, a founder of modern state theory, even dedicated a volume of his work *Republik* to astrology and the influence of stars on political fate, a view the speaker came to appreciate as offering a "healthiest method of political analysis" due to the unpredictability of political actors [01:15:47].

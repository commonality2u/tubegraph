April 24 is globally recognized, especially in Armenia, as the day of commemoration for the [[armenian_history_and_geopolitical_struggles | Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is a highly emotional event in Armenia, with the entire population walking to the monument on a hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The April 24, 1915 Arrests

The events of April 24, 1915, though distinct from the genocide itself, represent a crucial political step preceding the mass atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, a significant operation took place in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities within the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Approximately 235 to 250 prominent figures of the Armenian community in Istanbul were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These individuals included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters – all known and impactful intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A few days later, some groups were sent to Ayaş and Çankırı in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. While some managed to escape, many were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Similar operations occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. In some places, prominent Armenians were called to the governor's office, killed, and their bodies disposed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Purpose of the Operation

This "political collapse operation" aimed to "cleanse" the political leaders and voices of the Armenian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It mirrored methods seen in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman period]], where the state would suddenly apprehend individuals based on compiled information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Notably, this operation included those who were strongly against extremist nationalist Armenian movements, as well as individuals with no organizational ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The principle applied was to gather all prominent figures and leaders indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Escalation to Genocide

Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This gradually spiraled out of control, turning into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The Turkish state systematically designed a genocide project beginning around 1895, with the infrastructure consciously and resolutely prepared from 1913, and put into practice in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The objective was the elimination of the Armenian and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Historical Context and Rationale

The idea of cleansing Anatolia of non-Muslim populations, including Greeks and Assyrians, is considered Turkey's greatest trauma and has been advocated since the 1890s under Abdulhamid's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) initially held an optimistic approach after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, but by 1909-1910, following the Adana events, they returned to Abdulhamid's program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. By 1910 or 1911, the CUP concluded that a new Turkey could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

Despite the chaos of the Balkan War in 1912, when the CUP returned to power in 1913, all plans for the 1915 cleansing were already prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Distinction from Population Exchange

Unlike the expulsion of Turks from Rumelia or Circassians from the Caucasus, which often involved mutual population exchange with available land, the Armenians had "nowhere to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, facing a life-and-death struggle against Russia in World War I, viewed deporting Armenians to Syria as providing "enemy material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. The high probability of losing Erzurum and Van if defeated further fueled the decision against simple deportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. It became evident that massacres were the only perceived solution to prevent future claims for compensation, land, or property after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

## Turkish State's Policy of Denial

The Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the [[armenian_history_and_geopolitical_struggles | Armenian Genocide]] until 1975, particularly until 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. For 50 years (1915-1965), despite knowing about the genocide, Turkish officials preferred not to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Shift to Active Denial

The issue resurfaced globally in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union on the 50th anniversary in Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. While there were some murmurs in Turkey under the Demirel governments, Turkey still preferred silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. At that time, Turkey's reputation in the Western world was high, and there was a consensus to avoid discussing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

However, after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974-1975, an organization called ASALA emerged, initiating attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Simultaneously, the [[armenian_history_and_geopolitical_struggles | Armenian Genocide]] was suddenly "remembered" by the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. In response, Turkey adopted a policy of systematic denial, orchestrated by figures like Coşkun Kırca, Gün Aktan, and Kamuran İnan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Once this policy of "nothing like this happened" was adopted, Turkey found itself unable to backtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Consequences of Denial

After 1974, Turkey's international standing in the Western world significantly declined following the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This created a strong anti-Turkey sentiment in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Turkey's denial of a universally known past crime was perceived as "impudence" and "rudeness," which provided a convenient excuse for other nations to provoke Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This "stupid policy" has been a burden for Turkey for 45-47 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Denying the genocide is considered either ignorance or immorality, as it is an obvious fact recognized globally, with the exception of the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## A Missed Opportunity for Reconciliation (2005-2011)

Between 2005 and 2011, a brief "window of hope" opened for Turkey to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. During this period, a sentiment emerged in mainstream Turkish media (like Radical, Milliyet, Hürriyet, and Yeni Şafak) advocating for facing the incident directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. For the first time, the genocide was openly discussed in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Many opinion leaders from across the political spectrum acknowledged the terrible nature of what happened, that "millions of Armenians, the real children of this country, were miserable, destroyed, expelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

It was argued that Turkey could have publicly acknowledged this as a "shameful incident," which would have been beneficial for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This would have allowed Turkey to shed the "burden of hypocrisy" and overcome the genocide incident that has been an "obsession, a mental illness" for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. However, Turkey ultimately failed to show the courage to take this step on a governmental level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Enduring Impact

The [[armenian_history_and_geopolitical_struggles | Armenian Genocide]] is considered the most significant social and political event of the 20th century in Turkey, fundamentally altering its societal composition and forming the psychological and economic basis of its political structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Without confronting these historical facts, the issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

The speaker recounts a period of frequent travel across various regions, including provinces of France and cities in neighbouring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## European Journeys

Before the current broadcast from Paris, the speaker spent two weeks in the provinces of France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Prior to that, they were in Lisbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Caucasus and Middle Eastern Travels

Continuing the journey backwards, the speaker was in Yerevan before Lisbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, then Tabriz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and Tbilisi before Tabriz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Eastern Anatolia and Religious Sites

Between 2001 and 2006, the speaker prepared a travel book about Eastern Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. During this time, electricity had spread across the region, though perhaps not in Hakkari Şemdinli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A visit to the old Seyit Taha Dergah in Nehri village, now abandoned, left a significant impression, described as very striking and beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The speaker finds religious sites important for their beauty and consistently feels impressed by them, perceiving a spiritual quality in places where generations have worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

In 2004 or 2005, the speaker also visited Sıbgatullah Arvâsî's lodge in Kizan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These travels provided insights into local history, particularly the Naqshbandi movement and the intertwining of Armenian and Kurdish histories in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Global Hitchhiking Adventures

The speaker has extensive experience with hitchhiking, having greatly enjoyed it and finding it beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Notable hitchhiking journeys include:
*   From Paris to Istanbul in the summers of 2017 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
*   From Toronto to the Arctic Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

These experiences led to many adventures, meetings with diverse people, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>. However, the speaker notes that hitchhiking today is much more difficult than in the 1970s, as people are more fearful and accustomed to a regular lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

## [[international_travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_southern_europe | Societal Observations During Travel]]

When discussing the role of Muslims in various societies, the speaker draws on observations from different countries.

### [[travel_experiences_in_montenegro_and_ethiopia | Travel in Ethiopia]]
In Ethiopia, the mountainous regions and historical kingdom homelands, landowners, farmers, administrators, and educated classes (including university graduates and district governors) are predominantly Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. In contrast, bazaar shopkeepers in towns are typically Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. This contrasts with the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, where Armenians often filled similar roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. The speaker observed that Muslims, though a small minority, have a more dominant, respectful, and polite culture in the Ethiopian countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

### [[travel_experiences_in_marrakech_and_morocco | Travel in Sri Lanka]]
Similar observations were made in Sri Lanka, where the state is Buddhist, and most villagers and agricultural workers are Buddhist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. However, all jewelers, street vendors, hotel owners, and grocery store owners in towns are generally Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

## Living in England
The speaker considers London a wonderful, lively, diverse, and colorful city where many talented and qualified people live together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. While there are beautiful places in England, the speaker questions whether the climate is bearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Western societies like England can be very attractive if one has money and is part of a certain social environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. However, the speaker suggests that being a "second-class citizen" in less developed countries might be more enjoyable than being one in these Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

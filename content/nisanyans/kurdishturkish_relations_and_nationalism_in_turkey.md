This article explores various facets of Kurdish-Turkish relations and the concept of [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Turkish nationalism]], drawing on historical context, linguistic shifts, and political dynamics.

## Local Identities and the Term "Çinçavat"

The term "çinçavat" was raised as a topic of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is described as a derogatory adjective used by Karapapaks, or "kemel irin," to refer to "natives" or "Turks" in the Ardahan and Kars regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The word "çinçavat" is derived from Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> and means "atheist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, or "corrupted faith, corrupted religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Etymologically, "Çinç" means "weak" or "void," and "havad" means "faith," thus "lacking faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This clarification provided an opportunity to understand the [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | history]] and social history of the Ardahan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Historical Context of Ardahan and Regional Demographics
The Ottoman invasion of the region began in the 16th century following the defeat of the Iranian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The Ottomans encountered two Georgian Kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, one of which was the Jakeli dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Members of this Christian Georgian dynasty converted to Islam to retain their principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, becoming Beylerbeyi of Çıldır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The Çıldır region historically encompassed present-day Ardahan province, parts of Georgian Ahıska, and sections of Kars (Arpaçay district), and Erzurum (Oltu, Tortum districts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

An Ottoman census from 1595 revealed that almost all villages in Ardahan were inhabited by Christian Georgians, with only one or two Muslim households in some villages by 1595, two decades after the conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Although some villages like Oltu might have had Armenian populations, they were under Georgian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Over 90% of village names in Ardahan were Georgian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, as were hamlet, field, and river names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

After the Georgian rulers converted to Islam, some of the local population also converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. By the early 1800s, some churches were abandoned, but most remained intact, likely used as pilgrimage sites or shrines, suggesting a mixed religious identity among the locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Ottoman Rule and Identity Shifts
The transcript debunks the notion of "Kipchak Turks" in the region, stating there's no historical evidence for their presence in Ardahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, despite mentions of Kipchak warriors in Georgian [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | history]] centuries prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Between the 1595 census and early 18th-century tax records, the region experienced a catastrophic population decrease, not due to massacres, but likely from bad governance and exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Ottoman rule in these areas is characterized as an era of "cruelty and poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

The Russian conquest of the Georgian Kingdom in 1801 created an identity dilemma for Georgians living under Ottoman rule who had partially converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. By 1828, during the Ottoman-Russian War, some local Georgians migrated to the Russian side, while others remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. The remaining Georgians then began asserting a strong "Turkish" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>. Russian records from 1878 (50 years after Ardahan's capture) recorded these locals as Turks, not Georgians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. However, contemporary travelers (European, Georgian, Russian) claimed these "local Turks" were actually Georgians, noting their Georgian names and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

The speaker speculates that the "Turkish" identity adopted by these Georgians was a political, not a biological, claim: "We are Turks. We are subject to the state Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. This identity choice emerged from the ideological and psychological division between 1801 and 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.

### Karapapaks and Ahıska Turks
Karapapaks, Turkish-speaking Muslim migrants from Georgia who settled in villages emptied by the local population in 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>, became the dominant majority in Çıldır and Arpaçay districts today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. They used the term "çinçavat" for the Georgian converts in neighboring villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. While both groups were Muslim and Turkish-speaking, they disliked each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

The term "Ahıska Turks" is considered to have been invented in the 1990s and is evaluated as "standard nonsense of Turkists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. While Ahıska is a province, the ethnic basis for calling its Turks "Ahıska Turks" is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

## Turkey's Imperial Ambitions and Capacity

The idea of Turkey pursuing an imperial policy reminiscent of the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>, particularly after controlling Syria and expanding into Iraq, has been voiced since the Özal period (1980s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. This vision suggests Turkey should lead the region, encompassing Kurds, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and Syria, to form a Middle Eastern Union against the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. This idea resurfaced in the 2000s under Tayyip Erdoğan but receded after 2014-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

While the speaker is not inherently against the idea of empire, viewing it as potentially more civilized than narrow nationalism and capable of creating multinational civilization areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>, they offer a negative assessment of Turkey's capacity for such a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

Three key limitations are identified:
1.  **Natural Resources:** Turkey is poor in oil, natural gas, and strategic minerals, with water being its only significant regional resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.
2.  **Trained Manpower:** Decades of education policies have resulted in a "fiasco," leading to a scarcity of individuals capable of serious management, idea generation, and global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. A large portion of this talent has been lost or has emigrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.
3.  **Lack of Friends/Alliances:** Turkey has "no friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. Its relations with the Western alliance are "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>, and trust from Europeans and Americans is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. Hostility exists with Iran, and relations with the Arab world are poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>. Given these conditions, the dream of regional sovereignty is deemed unrealistic, and Turkey is likely to lose its current positions in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

## Integration, Turkification, and the Kurdish Question

The discussion touches on why Byzantium could not integrate incoming Turkmens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. In the east of present-day Turkey (east of the Euphrates), Islamic rule had existed for 300 years by the time of the Seljuk conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. Southeastern Anatolia was largely Muslim, while historical Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) remained largely Christian, though under Islamic governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. By the late 10th and early 11th centuries, after the collapse of the Islamic Empire, the region entered chaos, with emerging Armenian, Kurdish, and Assyrian formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. Byzantium briefly reconquered the region from 1020 onwards, but its authority collapsed instantly with the Turkish victory at Malazgirt in 1071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>.

The "Turkmens did not conquer Anatolia. The Turks conquered Anatolia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>, referring to commanders, adventurers, and professional soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>. The migration of Turkmens occurred after the conquest, drawn by the "gold rush" of newly opened lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. Assimilation requires political sovereignty, which was not the immediate dynamic as Turkmen tribes grazed sheep and disrupted Byzantine power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>.

### The Problem of a Mono-Ethnic State
The idea of a federal system or local autonomy has never been on Turkey's agenda, considered antithetical to the Republic's founding principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>. This is framed as a discussion about whether to grant autonomy to the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:30">[01:36:30]</a>. The historical experience, including that of the Ottoman Empire, suggests that granting autonomy eventually leads to independence and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. Real feudal systems in the Ottoman period, where autonomous units were connected to the center, invariably led to rebellion and suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>.

Turkey's decision to be an ethnic state, defining itself as Turkish, is seen as a "wrong decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>. While non-Muslim nations were "liquidated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a> and some smaller Muslim groups (Circassians, Pomaks, Lazs, Bosnians) were easily integrated due to their loyalty and historical protection by Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>, the Kurds were different.

> "The Kurds were not like that at any time in [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | history]] for hundreds of years. There was no such thing as Turkification in its [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | history]], it is a separate nation, as everyone knows, it is a separate nation now under the guise of Islam. You can bring these nations together. There is a common denominator between Turks and Kurds, but when you make Turkishness the founding principle of your state, the Kurds say, 'Oh, what are we, Bilan? It has nothing to do with it, we are not Turks.' Indeed, it is so now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:05">[01:41:05]</a>

Before the 1970s and 1980s, Kurds, mainly involved in animal husbandry, did not significantly challenge the state as long as they were not harassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. However, with increased social mobility, migration to cities, and the Turkish state's active attempts to control Kurdish regions under the pretext of security threats, "things got out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>. This led to Kurdish rebellions in neighboring countries and the emergence of Kurdish political formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>.

Furthermore, a significant number of Turkish Kurds migrated to Europe, forming distinct communities separate from Turks in the eyes of Europeans, with different restaurants, coffee houses, political statements, and flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. These individuals, exceeding a million, maintain ties with Turkey, reinforcing the awareness of separate identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:25">[01:43:25]</a>.

### Diverging Identities and Future Prospects
The attempt to maintain Turkey as a mono-ethnic or single-nation state is deemed "funny" and "unrealistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. The only alternative for this policy is "complete deportation and massacre," which Turkey cannot carry out, as Kurds are "a slightly more difficult nation" than Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>. Therefore, Turkey will "sooner or later give up this love either willingly or otherwise" of being a single-nation state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.

The speaker suggests two possible resolutions for this conflict: either "in a bloody manner, through conflict" or "by the demographically more vibrant party imposing its own existence on the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:43">[01:44:43]</a>.

A recent trend over the last 15-20 years highlights the clear divergence in names given to children by Kurds and Turks, forming "two separate nomenclatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. While historically, common Islamic names (Ahmet, Mehmet, İsmail, Ayşe) were used by both, and some Arabic-origin names showed differentiation (e.g., Abdulaziz being prevalent among Kurds), by the late 1990s to early 2000s, this overlap ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>. Secular Kurds increasingly prefer new generation Kurdish names, while Turks opt for Turkish or melodic names with no specific meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>. This linguistic and naming divergence further illustrates the growing ethnic distinction within the country.

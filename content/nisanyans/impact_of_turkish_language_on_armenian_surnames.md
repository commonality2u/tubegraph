During the latter period of the [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]], many adopted surnames like Pastırmacıyan, Deveciyan, Nalbantyan, Terziyan, Bodur Yan, Boşgezenyan, and Çolakyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The overwhelming prevalence of Turkish-origin surnames among Armenians was not due to Ottoman force, but rather the Armenians' own choice, largely influenced by the linguistic landscape of the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Historical Context of Surname Adoption

Before the late 18th century, it was very rare for [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] to have surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Only a few elite and aristocratic families had surnames from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Most common people, like Turks of that era, would identify themselves simply by their given name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

A "surname revolution" occurred around the 1820s, when all Armenians rapidly acquired surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. From that point on, they became known by these new surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Reasons for Turkish Surnames

Almost all of these newly adopted surnames were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon was primarily due to the dominant linguistic environment:

*   **Mother Tongue**: By 1828, the mother tongue for the vast majority of [[Language and cultural changes among Ottoman Armenians|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. In the 1820s, possibly 100% of Armenians either did not know Armenian at all, or only used it in church or specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The major educational efforts of the 19th century later helped revive Armenian as a cultural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Public Language**: Even if Armenian was spoken at home, Turkish was the common language for public conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The bazaar, where many Armenians worked, was a place where only Turkish was spoken within the Ottoman borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Social Integration**: For a surname to be declared and recognized by neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks, etc.), it needed to be in the public language, which was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Types of Turkish Surnames Adopted

In the first quarter of the 19th century, nearly all Armenians who adopted surnames chose Turkish ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While a few adopted their father's name (e.g., Sarkisyan, Hagopyan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, the vast majority fell into two categories:

*   **[[Professional and characteristic names in Armenian surnames|Professional Names]]**: Many surnames reflected professions, such as "shoemaker," "tailor," or "shrimp exporter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Armenians were often associated with specific professions, unlike Turks who might have official duties or be villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **[[Professional and characteristic names in Armenian surnames|Personal Characteristics]]**: Surnames were also based on personal characteristics, such as "loquacious," "lame," "toothy," or "long" (e.g., Bodur Yan, Boşgezenyan, Çolakyan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Later Shifts in Surnames

While some surnames are purely Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, families with Turkish surnames sometimes changed them to Armenian ones at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This shift was influenced by modern nationalism, leading to names like "Kenvosgeriyan" (jeweler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, the original, older Armenian surnames were almost always Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Interestingly, [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames|Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames shortly after their Ottoman counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The main difference was the suffix, with [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames|Iranian Armenians]] typically using "yant" (with a 'T' sound) instead of "yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This linguistic distinction highlights the cultural differences between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

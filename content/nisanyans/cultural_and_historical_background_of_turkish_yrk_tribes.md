The Yörük are Turkish-speaking communities primarily found in the mountainous regions of Western Anatolia, including the Aegean and Mediterranean areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Until about 100 years ago, they maintained a nomadic lifestyle with a typical tribal organization and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. Yörük elements were also prevalent in Thrace and the mountains of present-day Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

## Characteristics and Lifestyle
Yörük tribes generally did not like paying taxes to the state and lived in tents, organized tribally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. They typically spoke their own language and were not on good terms with villagers or the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Their nomadic cycle often involved roaming the mountains in summer and settling in villages or towns during winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

## Distinction from Turkmens
The Yörük are generally considered distinct from Turkmens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. Unlike the Turkmen, Yörüks have little connection to the Oghuz tribal structure or its mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>, as the mythology of the Oghuz tribal structure is dominant among Turkmens but absent among Yörüks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

## Historical Origins and Theories
Information regarding the [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical origins]] of Yörüks in regions like Greece and Bulgaria is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

A long-standing theory suggests that Yörüks are descendants of groups who migrated from [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | Central Asia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. However, this idea should be approached with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

An alternative theory, proposed by an anthropologist named N.H. (possibly Catalan or Southern French), suggests that present-day Yörüks are a continuation of ancient Anatolian nomadic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This theory is based on the fact that similar Yörük-like tribes, living on animal husbandry in the mountains of Western Anatolia and the Balkans, existed during the ancient Roman and Byzantine eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. Examples include the Isaurians and Pisidians, who had their own languages and lived as nomads in the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. The exact disappearance of these older groups is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

## [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | Tribal Structure]] and [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_of_turkish_language | Language Adoption]]
A tribe is viewed as an economic union and a social organization, capable of becoming a war organization when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Weaker tribes could be absorbed by stronger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. To gain political and economic power, tribes sought to include as many useful people as possible, including those from different backgrounds, bandits, or impoverished villagers who turned to animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

While these new members might speak other languages, they were obliged to speak the common language (Turkish) during joint negotiations and congresses where the tribal leader's orders were paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Learning Turkish is relatively easy, and men would typically adopt it over time, even if women continued to speak their original languages within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. This process allowed individuals to become "Turkic" without necessarily realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

## Tribal Myths and Genealogies
[[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | Tribal myths]] and foundation stories, such as the genealogies of Turkish, Turkmen, Kurdish tribes, and Armenian noble dynasties, often contain coded social hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. These narratives, while seemingly simple tales of conflicts, peace, marriages, and migrations, provide significant information understandable by those familiar with the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

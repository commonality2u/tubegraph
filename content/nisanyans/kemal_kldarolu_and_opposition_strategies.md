From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker reflects on the recent Turkish elections, expressing surprise at the widespread conviction among friends and acquaintances that the government would change, leading them to prepare celebrations for May 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He, however, had based his predictions on logical reasons for why the election could not be won by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Reasons for the Opposition's Defeat

The speaker outlines three primary reasons for the opposition's inability to win the election:

### 1. Government's Super Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
The current government possesses a "super power" due to a concentration of power in Türkiye that has existed for many decades, specifically since the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This power is not easily relinquished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The opposition lacks a comparable force or element capable of overcoming this established power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### 2. Incompetent Political Leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
There was no significant social excitement or emotional explosion to create the necessary power element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The opposition lacked a strong political leadership or alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The candidate put forward, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, is described as "probably the most incompetent and most doomed to defeat person in the history of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This candidate had lost approximately ten previous elections and consistently failed to increase his vote share, remaining stable at around 24-25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Even with the inclusion of three additional parties in the recent election, his support remained at a similar level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### 3. Ignorance and Bigotry of the "White Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
The "educated classes of Türkiye," often referred to as "White Turks," are criticized for their profound ignorance in understanding social dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. They fail to comprehend why a large segment of society supports [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] or why their own discourse is perceived as "ridiculous and disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The speaker argues that these groups are incredibly bigoted, accusing others of bigotry while exhibiting it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They portray themselves as democrats while labeling the populace as ignorant, stupid, or corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This elite offers no dynamism or appeal to society, hoping a retired civil servant (Kılıçdaroğlu) will win simply because he presents a Western image and a "watered down" discourse of [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Atatürkism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Personal Stance on the Election Outcome
The speaker states that if he could vote, he would have voted for Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, not because he believes Kılıçdaroğlu would succeed, but due to a "very strong belief that [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] must go now" after 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Critique of the Current Government
While acknowledging the need for change, the speaker does not consider the current government to be "very unsuccessful" by Turkish standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. He questions who could do better given current conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He notes that the government has abandoned its initial promises since 2015, such as justice reform, solving the Kurdish problem, and establishing peace with Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It has also made significant errors, including the "terrible fiasco" of entering Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Reasons for Erdoğan's "Expiration Date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>
1.  **Arbitrary Administration and Denial of Justice**: An arbitrary administration has become dominant, shaking society's conscience regarding justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This includes the imprisonment of prominent figures like Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtaş, countless lawsuits for insulting the president, and the non-implementation of court decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. These practices are deemed "extremely harmful and dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
2.  **Excessive Accumulation of Power**: Twenty years is too long for one person to hold such unlimited, uncontrolled, and unbalanced authority, leading to a "great poisoning of power" and arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. State power is a dangerous weapon, and human nature dictates its misuse when unchecked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Good systems require complex structures and layers of balance to prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
3.  **Hate Speech as a Political Basis**: [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]] has adopted hate speech as the foundation of his politics, constantly injecting hatred and anger into society for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This has led to all segments of society "going mad with hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## Future Scenarios for Political Change
The speaker does not believe [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]] can be overthrown through elections because there is no strong, hopeful opposition figure capable of galvanizing the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. The system seems designed to prevent such a figure from emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

Overthrowing [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]] by ideologically hostile forces would have "terrible consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, leading to a "terrible revenge table" due to the injustices committed over 20 years (e.g., economic corruption, drug trafficking, statutory decrees, actions in Kurdish provinces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

The speaker proposes two main possibilities for [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]]'s departure from office:
1.  **Voluntary Departure**: He might leave on his own (unlikely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
2.  **Controlled Removal from Within**: He must be removed in a controlled, legal, and decent manner by someone within his own staff or power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This is considered the second strongest possibility (after the current regime continuing), with the speaker assigning a 75% probability to the current regime continuing for the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Analysis of the [[turkish_political_landscape_and_election_analysis | Turkish Political Landscape]]

### Societal Characteristics
Turkish society is described as "extremely pragmatic" and "opportunist," with a more flexible mindset than European societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. It is not inherently conservative but appears so out of helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. If offered a compelling alternative that makes them "feel good," they will abandon current idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

### The "Three-Color Map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>
The speaker identifies three distinct political blocks in Türkiye based on election maps:
1.  **Central Anatolia**: A "completely yellow" block.
2.  **Western Strip**: A thin strip from İzmir to Istanbul, including Thrace, Çanakkale, Izmir, and Muğla, representing another block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
3.  **Southeast (Kurdish Region)**: A large block, including Tunceli and a vast "Kurdistan," forming a third distinct block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

There is no consistency, connection, or genuine partnership between these latter two opposition blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. The political alliance between them is superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. The speaker doubts that a geography with a strictly oppositionist and "ethnic cultural alien texture" (referring to the Kurdish region) can maintain political unity with Turkey in the long term, especially in a state of polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### Kurdish Political Movement
The HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party), representing Kurdish nationalism, is criticized for entering the orbit of the US and EU after the situation in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This is deemed a "political mistake" that led to its poor performance in the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. The speaker believes the party (or its successor) will not have a future without radical change and should focus directly and solely on defending Kurdish national interests and their struggle for democracy and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. A "terrible strategic mistake" was made by aligning with the Turkish Workers' Party within an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

### Election Surprises
*   **MHP's Success**: The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) showed a "very successful performance," achieving its highest vote share in recent history despite its leader Devlet Bahçeli's "absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The speaker suggests that right-wing parties that align with the Republican People's Party (CHP) tend to die, while those that do not, win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. MHP's success and the Good Party's failure are seen through this lens.
*   **Good Party's Fiasco**: The Good Party (İYİ Parti) is considered a "fiasco" and the "loser of the election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Despite polls predicting 13-14%, it received 9.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. A significant portion of its voters are believed to have shifted to MHP, possibly as a reaction against the CHP-HDP alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>.
*   **Deva and Davutoğlu's Parties**: The parties of Ali Babacan (Deva) and Ahmet Davutoğlu (Gelecek Partisi), who broke away from the AKP, performed poorly, with Deva having less than 0.5% support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

## Impact of the Earthquake on Elections
The earthquake, contrary to social media predictions, did not cause a shift in [[turkish_political_landscape_and_election_analysis | political preferences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. Cities severely affected, like Maraş, saw [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] win with large majorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The speaker argues that it is illogical to hold the government responsible for an earthquake, as such disasters have occurred for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. The public in affected areas largely discounted the social media narrative blaming the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

## Internet Age and Democracy
The speaker believes that the internet age is leading to a *decrease* in democracy, not an increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Information bombardment on the internet hinders rational decision-making, encouraging a "herd mentality" where people blindly follow a chosen "pole" or authority figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. This trend, coupled with the increasing strengthening of bureaucracies under state control, leads to a passive society confined to sharing emojis on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

## The Second Round and Election Manipulation
The speaker speculates that the Supreme Election Council's delayed announcement of a second round was a "very skillful move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. By not immediately declaring [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]] the winner despite expectations, it allowed for the great disappointment among the opposition to dissipate over 15 days, making it too late for mass reaction or street protests when the final result was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

Regarding allegations of election manipulation, the speaker contends that if results are indeed manipulated, then elections cannot be the solution to the regime problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. He argues that the opposition should have boycotted the elections from the start when [[criticism_of_recep_tayyip_erdoan_and_turkish_political_dynamics | Erdoğan]]'s candidacy was deemed illegal by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Participating in the "theater" undermines their claims of manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

### Unreliability of Polls
The speaker states that election polls have become "completely ridiculous" and "ineffective propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This is because political players have learned to manipulate them, and the public has learned to lie when surveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. All major polling companies gave similar, ultimately incorrect, rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>.

## International Relations
The speaker notes that Türkiye's relationship with Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia is deepening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. He believes Türkiye must withdraw from Syria, and to avoid this appearing as a defeat, the withdrawal should be done in agreement and cooperation with Russia and the Saudis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. For Türkiye, the most rational option is to align with Russia, seen as the "undisputed winner of the Ukraine War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

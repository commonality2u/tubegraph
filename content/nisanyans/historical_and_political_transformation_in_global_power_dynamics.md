From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The world is currently undergoing [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical transformations]] on an unprecedented scale, moving from a long period of stasis to a point where it can no longer sustain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The political balance established after World War I, which sustained itself with minor adjustments, has now collapsed and transformed with a "big bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This collapse is seen as a positive development, as the previous order in America and Europe was "rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. While the exact outcome is uncertain, a significant upheaval is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Shifting Global Power Dynamics

The existing [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]] are being fundamentally reshaped, with new actors emerging and traditional alliances facing significant challenges.

### Decline of Western Hegemony and NATO

The speaker contends that the US has been defeated in all recent wars it has entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. The Ukraine war is presented as another such defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, which will lead to the end of NATO if it loses this "serious and important war" after significant financial and political ideological investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The core assumption of NATO – that it will support members with overwhelming military power – was disproven in Ukraine, demonstrating the alliance's inability to win a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This defeat creates an "extremely risky situation for America" and the possibility of the alliance disintegrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The initial aim of Russia in Ukraine was to quickly occupy Kiev, but the strategy shifted to destroying NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>, a goal that is clearly observed to be achieved as NATO has "collapsed" and is "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.

### The Crisis of Europe

Europe is described as having "lost everything": its industry, military power, and ability to act together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Its leadership is characterized as "extremely weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a> and maintaining power through tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. The European Union project is seen as irrelevant to its initial goals, drowned by a "bureaucratic oligarchy" in Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:00">[57:13:00]</a>.

Europe's decline is attributed to several factors:
*   **Economic Impoverishment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:00">[57:58:00]</a>: Europe lacks the money, power, and courage for large-scale public and private projects, unlike China, Arab states, and Russian oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:24:00">[58:24:00]</a>. This is observed even on an individual basis with European tourists being notably frugal compared to Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30:00">[59:30:00]</a>.
*   **Demographic Shift** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>: The European population has not been renewed, leading to a ridiculously increased average age, particularly among white Europeans (reaching the 60s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. The solution of importing people from Islamic countries and black Africa has led to an "unprecedented social crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Leadership Quality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>: The quality of administrative staff has significantly decreased over the last 20 years, with European leaders described as "stupid people" and "a cadre of nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>. The American vice president's speech at the Munich conference explicitly called out Europe's leadership as dictatorial, illogical, and brain-dead, stating that the US and Russia would solve the Ukraine issue without Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.

### The New World Order

The emerging [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]] suggest three major powers: America, Russia, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. The time has come to establish a new, multi-focused, three-focused world order among these powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This period is considered one of the great turning points in [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | history]], comparable to the Treaty of 1930 or the turn against Napoleon in 1813-14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.

## Major Global Crises as Catalysts for Change

The world has been shaken by three major crises in the last five years, accelerating [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical transformations]]:

### The COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 incident, which began around January 29-30, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:46">[02:38:46]</a>, is characterized as a "big fraud" and a "huge fraud with every element" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>. The speaker, who observed the systematic "pandemic propaganda" and preparation for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>, believes it was consciously organized as a social project by the governing powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>. The event, initially designed as a biological warfare rehearsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:13">[02:17:13]</a>, devolved into an "orgy of bureaucracies" and a "Bureaucratic Enthusiasm ceremony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. The vaccine initiative is questioned as potentially being a fraud scheme to generate billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:15">[02:27:15]</a>.

### The Ukraine War
The Ukraine conflict, beginning in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, is seen as a strategic defeat for the [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western alliance]]. Due to Russia's vast size, population, economic, industrial, and military power compared to Ukraine (one-fifth to one-sixth the size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, a long-term war victory for the West is deemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. NATO's role was limited to financing and supplying weapons, not direct military engagement, making defeat inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The war's true aim from Russia's perspective shifted from merely defeating Ukraine to destroying NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, a strategy that is seen as successful given NATO's current state of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
The October 2023 Gaza operation is described as a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The speaker argues that the Israeli state knew about the attack beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The goal of the attackers was to capture hostages for exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:04">[03:07:04]</a>. The killing of civilians, especially at the concert, is attributed to Israeli state forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:8:04">[03:8:04]</a>, with the purpose of creating a narrative of "terrible terrorists" to justify "ethnic cleansing" of the Palestinian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This is seen as a "brave project to solve the Palestinian issue from its roots" that has not yet succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:26">[03:08:26]</a>. Despite the manipulation, the "real inner face of the story" has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:01">[04:00:01]</a>.

## Broader [[Historical and Modern Societal Transformations | Societal and Political Transformations]]

### Critique of Modern Institutions
The speaker outlines a critique of several fundamental modern institutions:
*   **Parliamentary Institution**: Considered a 19th-century institution that has become "obsolete" and "does not function anywhere in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.
*   **Secondary Education**: Middle school and high school systems are described as "bankrupt" and "finished" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. The curriculum is outdated, irrelevant to real life, and promotes laziness, leading to a lack of practical skills for young people outside of university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Political Parties**: In their current form, political parties are seen as the "biggest obstacle to creating a rational public policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:16">[02:51:16]</a>.
*   **Press and Media**: The classical expressions of freedom of the press and information are losing meaning as the traditional press and broadcasting system has "collapsed" and has a "very short life left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The internet, as the primary communication platform, cannot be regulated with 19th-century ideas of press freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:60:00">[02:60:00]</a>.

### The Misapplication of Mathematics in Social Sciences
The attempt by social sciences to gain a mathematical image, particularly from the American school after 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, is critiqued. This phenomenon emerged historically from the success of mathematics in fields like astronomy and physics (e.g., Galileo's work) as a tool to challenge institutional authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, this mathematical model fails when applied to living beings, especially humans, because it cannot explain human behavior or the concept of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Much of what is taught as social science in universities (sociology, economics, anthropology, political science) is seen as an exercise in "political propaganda" and "social propaganda" designed to justify the superiority of one group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:77:00">[04:77:00]</a>.

### Regional Political Dynamics
*   **Latin America**: Leaders like Bukele of El Salvador are admired for their effective governance and achievements in addressing gang violence and economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. His approach to America is seen as balanced – not provoking, but maintaining a distant friendship due to the vast [[power_dynamics_and_elite_control_in_western_societies | power difference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Argentina's Milei, however, is viewed with suspicion, as his aggressive pursuit of privatization (a failed policy of the 1980s) is unlikely to yield positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Turkey (Türkiye)**: The speaker discusses the complexities of Turkish identity, noting its dual meaning: as a national identity for all citizens and as a term for a privileged, specific ethnic group, leading to much "literature of lies" about Asian/Turkmen origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The current political situation in Turkey is described as irrational and destructive, resembling the "last days of Pompeii" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a>. The speaker predicts that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's presidency will continue as long as he is alive, and that political change will likely come through a mass uprising, a regime collapsing with a bang, or a quick operation overthrowing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current era is one of intense and rapid [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]], where political events are increasingly unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>. The speaker believes that these are days that will be "intensely discussed" and "considered as an example" in [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | historical analyses]] written centuries from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

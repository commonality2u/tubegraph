## Overview of Separatism in the UK

The speaker addresses questions regarding separatist movements on the British Isles, specifically concerning Wales and Scotland, and their potential to break away from the British monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The perspective offered is that in significant conflicts with two opposing sides, such as those advocating for separation versus those against it, both sides can be considered right to certain extents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The [[british_sociopolitical_issues_and_mismanagement | United Kingdom]], or British State, is perceived to be in a continuous decline since losing its Empire in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This decline is evident in the gradual and irreversible disintegration of its institutions, national culture, economic prosperity, military power, and international credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Specific Regions and Their Separatist Ambitions

*   **Wales**: The speaker is unsure if there is serious separatism in Wales today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Scotland**: There is "definitely" serious separatism in Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: There is also "certainly" serious separatism in Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The unification of Northern and Southern Ireland, leading to independence from British rule, appears to be nearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Philosophical and Historical Context of Separation

The discussion extends to the broader concept of national identity and the right to independence, questioning whether it is inherently "right" for any community to demand separation and what the limits of such claims should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Examples such as the independence of Scots, regional differences within Scotland (e.g., Highlands), and the potential for a capital city to gain independence are raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

The speaker ties these discussions to the concept of the Nation State and the "right of determination," arguing that when taken seriously, it leads to a "logical absurdity of political theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This is illustrated by historical examples like the break-up of the Soviet Union, where regions like Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia sought independence, and even within these new states, further secessionist movements (e.g., Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan) emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

The speaker also cites the example of Montenegro, where the definition of a separate Montenegrin language and an independent church from the Serbian church has led to societal division and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This highlights the unending nature of such identity-based distinctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

The historical behavior of various ethnic groups within Turkey is also mentioned:
*   **Circassians**: Displayed significant resistance against Russia, were deported, and found refuge in the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. After initial hesitation during the Ottoman collapse, some rebelled for Istanbul while others cooperated with Ankara, eventually becoming a strong, loyal pillar of the Turkish Republic around 1927-28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>.
*   **Laz people**: Have historically lived rebelliously, showing a "shrugging attitude" towards state authority, and considered piracy and banditry acceptable professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. A major rebellion against the Ottoman State in 1828 under Tuzcuoğlu Memiş Ağa lasted nearly 15 years and was violently suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. Since then, they have preferred to remain calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   [[the_role_of_kurdish_political_movement_and_national_unity | Kurds]]: Implicitly contrasted with the Laz and Circassians when asked if the latter have ever rebelled "like the Kurds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

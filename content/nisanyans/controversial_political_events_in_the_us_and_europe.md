## Political Shifts in the United States

Recent political developments in the United States have been described as "incredible events" at the political level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Within two weeks of a new administration, actions and decisions unprecedented in years have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

A significant action was the freezing of all civil society grants by the United States for three months, followed by the apparent abolition of USAID, the institution responsible for transferring money to foreign countries for various political and cultural purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. USAID's annual budget was $60 billion, supporting political parties, media, academic institutions, and individuals abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This cut is seen as an "incredible event" and a "geopolitical revolution" or "earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. It is predicted that this will lead to the bankruptcy of many media organizations in Europe and surrounding countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, as many institutions operating under the guise of civil society or independent press receive funding from America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. This drastic cut signifies a "financial bankruptcy" alongside ideological and diplomatic bankruptcies following recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

### Shift in Foreign Policy

A striking development is the interview of the new U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, where he articulated a shift in American foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. For the first time since the 1970s, a Western foreign minister expressed "reasonable things" and "very clearly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Rubio stated that an 80-year period of "Global Dominance" is over, and the U.S. must accept the existence of multiple great powers, at least three, and pursue a balance policy based on mutual national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. This model mirrors European diplomacy principles from 200-300 years before 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The U.S.'s "passion for world domination" became pathological after 1991, influenced by an "adolescent" and fact-ignoring perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

## Freedom of Expression and Legal Debates in Europe

There is a strong belief that freedom of expression in England is no longer guaranteed, with "hundreds, even thousands of people" arrested daily for opinions expressed on social media, especially concerning Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. These actions are described as "directly resembling fascist practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

However, the notion that freedom of expression is unlimited in any country or society is refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Three basic limits are generally recognized: insult, slander, and incitement to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

*   **Insult:** Considered an attack on a person's honor and personality in most countries, punishable by imprisonment or heavy fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Human honor and reputation are values that must be protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
    *   Insulting a deceased person should not be a crime, as the person cannot be harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
    *   Prosecuting insulting the head of state as a personal insult is wrong in principle, as the head of state's reputation is unlikely to be damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Such an act could be considered a crime against public order or state authority, to be prosecuted *ex officio* by prosecutors, with evidence of serious damage to state authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   **Slander:** A very serious crime, involving imputing false information about a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. The right to prove the information is a basic complement to the crime of slander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.
*   **Incitement to Violence:** Should be subject to criminal sanctions if it constitutes a "real incitement" leading to immediate, direct violence, such as calls to attack specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. However, "hate speech" is often viewed as a "fraud" because prohibiting the expression of hatred is a totalitarian measure attempting to police morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

## Historical Political and Economic Influences in Europe

### Protestantism and Capitalism
The relationship between Protestantism and Capitalism has been extensively discussed, particularly noting that England became the "homeland" of industrialization and capitalism in the late 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This link was initially framed as English (Protestant) superiority over French (Catholic) society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>. Later, in the late 19th century, Germans also examined this relationship to explain their industrial success, viewing it as a dimension of national competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

The crucial difference between Protestantism and Catholicism, often overlooked, is the Protestant emphasis on individual reading of holy texts, which led to early near 100% literacy rates in Protestant countries by the 16th century, fostering a different culture and urban middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.

### Judaism and Capitalism
The role of Judaism in capitalism has been less discussed, especially after 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. From the late 19th century, banks, which became determining institutions of capitalism, were "almost entirely a Jewish phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. While British capitalists established textile factories and Germans focused on steel, arms, and automotive industries, Jews established banks, leading capitalism to shift from industry to finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. After 1945, discussing the relationship between capitalism and specific religious/ethnic groups became highly taboo and even illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. However, this is changing, particularly influenced by the Gaza conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

## State, Violence, and Social Cohesion

The concept of the state as a company is a "misconception" that was fashionable in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. The state is fundamentally a "violent organization" that monopolizes the use of violence within a certain area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This monopoly allows the state to collect "tribute" (taxes) from people, enforced by the threat of imprisonment or even death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. No private company can perform this function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

The role of experts, such as doctors, becoming "executive officers" by integrating with the state's coercive power (police) is seen as a "very worrying, very scary" societal danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. When doctors align with the armed forces, they cease to be solely medical professionals, losing moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Similarly, the medical profession's transformation into a capitalist business focused on monetary interests also undermines its integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

Imposing "strict rules that deter people from using physical violence" can be counterproductive for social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. While social order requires reducing violence through arbitration and negotiation, rejecting *all* violence as bad leads to its monopolization by the state and its armed representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. This approach, by strictly preventing individual violence, can lead to a societal "explosion like a volcano" in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.

## European Immigration Policies

Europe's policy of broadly admitting "irregular migrants and refugees" while being "so strict in granting tourist visas to educated people" is seen as "bureaucratic stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:44">[01:57:44]</a>. This suggests a disconnect between stated objectives and practical outcomes in European immigration management.

The speaker frequently travels and shares various experiences from trips across Europe and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Recent European Travels
Recent travels have included visits to the provinces of [[cultural_and_historical_observations_on_france_and_europe | France]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> and Lisbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Journeys in the Middle East and Caucasus
Before the European trips, the speaker had traveled extensively through the Middle East and Caucasus region. This included eating in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, Tabriz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and Tbilisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Eastern Anatolian Travel Book
Between 2001 and 2006, the speaker was engaged in preparing a travel book about [[cultural_transformation_in_the_middle_east_turkey_and_iran | Eastern Anatolia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. During this period, electricity had spread throughout the region, though it was not yet present in Hakkari Åžemdinli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

One notable visit was to the abandoned Seyit Taha Dergah in Nehri village, which left a strong impression due to its striking beauty and importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The speaker has always been impressed by religious sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, feeling a spiritual connection at places where generations have worshipped, regardless of personal belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It's considered insensitive not to feel the presence of sincere human emotion at such sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

During these travels, the speaker also encountered young people linked to both the MHP Kurdish national movement and the Naqshbandi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The 19th century in the [[cultural_transformation_in_the_middle_east_turkey_and_iran | Turkish Land]] experienced a significant social upheaval, with the Halidi order playing a crucial role in the restoration of Islamic belief and social order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Many places visited had intertwined Armenian and Kurdish histories, where some Armenians collectively accepted Islam and became Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Those who insisted on Christianity faced dire consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Hitchhiking Adventures
The speaker has extensively engaged in hitchhiking, finding it to be an enjoyable and beneficial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   In the summers of 2017 and 2018, a journey from Paris to Istanbul was completed by hitchhiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
*   Another period saw hitchhiking from Toronto to the Arctic Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

These travels led to many adventures, meetings with diverse people, and significant learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. However, it's noted that modern hitchhiking is considerably more difficult than in the 1970s, with fewer people participating and increased fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. People have grown accustomed to more modest and regular lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

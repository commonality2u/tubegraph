During the period between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet Union, and by extension the Russian Empire, was liquidated almost completely peacefully and without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This peaceful dissolution is considered an unprecedented historical event, where a great world empire surrendered without fighting and withdrew its armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

At this time, [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russian society]] held a "big dream" and expectation of being accepted by the West, embraced, helped, and guided towards establishing democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They saw themselves as a natural part of European civilization and culture, having produced figures like Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. [[Russia and Western society comparison | Russians]] believed that after a difficult period under a "bad administration," Europe should accept them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Many even hoped [[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] would be accepted into NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## The "Honeymoon" and Western "Looting"

From 1991 to 1995, there was a significant "honeymoon" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. However, the Western world, particularly Americans and Germans, "swooped down on Russia with an army of looters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Adventurers, robbers, opportunists, swindlers, and scammers targeted [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russia's]] natural resources, industrial facilities and products, art collections, treasures, and even women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Some individuals who gained power or positions within the old Communist Party regime also joined this looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. As a result, [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russian society]] encountered the "ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Emergence of Oligarchs as a Counter-Force

By around 1998, [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russian society]], by natural reflex, began to actively work to prevent this ongoing plunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This meant resisting the continued exploitation of their resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The method employed was not "clean," as a "looting army" could not be dealt with by clean methods; violence was deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

This necessary "violence" involved individuals referred to as "Russian oligarchs" or "Russian mafias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. These influential and authorized Russians, along with others from former Soviet countries, initiated efforts to dismantle the "looting process" of the Yeltsin years, using force when necessary, including "elbows, fists, and bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The Western world reacted violently to this pushback, claiming [[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] was "not a democratic country" and that "the law is not valid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. They had previously encouraged Western entities to acquire [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russian]] assets like gold mines, oil, gas, and works of art, even to "collect orphaned children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Putin's Role and International Reaction

The American leadership, according to the speaker, aimed to keep [[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] "hungry" and to break it apart further, similar to the dissolution of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The flashpoint for this was Chechnya, where foreign-trained Islamic militants, particularly those pushed through TÃ¼rkiye, were sent to instigate guerrilla warfare and a war of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The expectation was that if this succeeded, similar movements would spread to 41 other regions of [[Russias historical and cultural context | Russia]], including Tatarstan, Crimea, and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

When Vladimir Putin was elected in 2002, his primary duty was to combat this threat, a "life-or-death struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The forces that pacified Chechnya were considered ideal for this task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. After this, the Western world never "forgave Putin" for suppressing these "bearded jihadists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the current [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia-Ukraine war]] is a continuation of this dynamic, where [[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] is defending itself against being cornered by NATO's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. The argument is that the threat of violence and encircling a nation can provoke a violent response, even if using "ugly methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

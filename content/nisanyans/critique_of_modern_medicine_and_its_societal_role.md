The speaker offers a critical perspective on modern medicine, asserting that it has "gone out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:51">[02:18:51]</a>. This viewpoint has previously led to discussions and polemics on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:52">[02:19:52]</a>.

## Perceived Overreach of the Medical Industry

A key point of the critique is the belief that the dominance of the "medical industry" in societies should be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. The term "medical industry" is broadly defined to include doctors, hospitals, hospital administration staff, the pharmaceutical industry, and the laboratory industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:37">[02:22:37]</a>. The speaker argues that this collective entity has "gained an uncontrolled power in society that it does not deserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:22:45]</a>.

## Impact on Quality of Life and Morality

Contrary to its perceived purpose, the speaker believes that the medical industry's uncontrolled power actually "decreases the quality of human life, let alone increasing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>. Furthermore, the attitudes and behaviors demonstrated by this industry are described as "extremely immoral, extremely wrong, extremely illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:11">[02:23:11]</a>.

## Challenges to Rational Discussion

It is deemed "very difficult" to discuss how the medical industry's power can be prevented or regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:28">[02:23:28]</a>. This difficulty stems from what is characterized as a "terror regime" in the country:
> "As soon as you utter any negative word about medicine, they attack you like wild dogs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:38">[02:23:38]</a>
This atmosphere means "there is no ground for a rational discussion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a>. Any open discussion is met with "very violent, very irrational, very immoral attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:56">[02:23:56]</a>. As a result, the speaker chooses not to "expose myself to such rudeness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>, implying that a rational debate, if possible, must occur away from public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

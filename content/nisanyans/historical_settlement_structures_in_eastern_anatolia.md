This article explores the historical settlement structures and [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | ethnic and cultural changes]] in Eastern Anatolia, drawing insights from the book "Turkey East of Ankara," published in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The book is bilingual, with separate Turkish and English versions offering different approaches to the same subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The author aimed to present the complex subject of Eastern Türkiye without causing disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Research and Methodology

The information presented is based on extensive travels throughout Eastern Anatolia over a six-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The author visited numerous locations, including Ardahan, Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and northern Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. During these travels, interviews were conducted with various individuals, including villagers, cultural figures, gendarmerie commanders, and police station commanders, to understand the region's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Pre-20th Century Urban Demographics

Prior to the early 20th century, the major cities in Eastern Anatolia predominantly had Turkish populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Van**: The city center of Van showed no trace of Kurds in the 1910s, with about half of the city's population being Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır**: In Diyarbakır's center, Turkish was spoken alongside Kurdish, and most major families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. More than half of the city was governed by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Mardin**: While the ruling class was Christian, the city's language was Arabic. Despite this, all ruling families considered themselves Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### The "Turkification" Process
The Ottoman ruling class was cosmopolitan, comprising individuals of various origins (e.g., Albanian, Dagestani, Georgian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. When people migrated to cities, attained education, or gained positions within the state mechanism, they would automatically become "Turks" and adopt the Turkish language and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This process meant that the families in cities like Diyarbakır, even if of Circassian descent, were considered Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The concept of "Turk" referred to a person whose origins could be from any part of the empire, but who integrated into the social structure, spoke Turkish, and was recognized as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This contributed to the [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics of ethnic groups in Turkey]] and [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | historical narratives on Turkish and regional identities]].

### Non-Muslim Populations
Non-Muslims, particularly Armenians, played a significant role in providing urban services and formed a substantial part of the population in cities like Van and Diyarbakır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. In Diyarbakır, Armenians constituted 20-30% of the population, alongside Assyrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. There was significant intermarriage between Turkish and Armenian families, with many Turks having Armenian grandmothers or great-aunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This highlights the close [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian history and heritage in Turkey]] in the region.

## Impact of Armenian Elimination

The elimination of the Armenian population had severe and unexpected consequences for the region's urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became uninhabitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Essential services like dentistry and tailoring disappeared because the cosmopolitan group that provided the economic and cultural infrastructure had vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This significantly impacted the [[impact_of_migration_on_urban_centers_in_eastern_anatolia | urban centers in Eastern Anatolia]].

## Republican Period and Demographic Shifts

During the early Republic period, the Turkish-speaking elite in these cities diminished, with their children often moving to Ankara or Istanbul for education and not returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. As a result, these cities gradually collapsed and decayed until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

A major demographic shift occurred in the 1960s with a massive migration from villages to cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This initially led to the cities in the region becoming more "Turkified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Kurdish Demographic Dominance
By the 1970s and 1980s, when the author first visited Mardin, there was no trace of Kurds in the city center; the rural areas were Kurdish, while the city center was predominantly Arab and Arabic-speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, resistance to Kurdish migration into Mardin led to the massive growth of nearby Kızıltepe, which became a larger, predominantly Kurdish city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Eventually, this barrier collapsed, and Kurds became the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Currently, Kurds represent the majority in Diyarbakır (80-90%, if not 100%) and Van (by far the majority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The greatest success of the Republican regime in Eastern Türkiye has been the complete "Kurdification" of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. While Kurds were previously a numerically significant but primarily rural element, they are now almost homogeneously dominant in their own region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

This demographic shift has created social demands that are considered impossible to prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Kurdish, spoken by a population of nearly 20 million with pride, is seen as needing official status, to be taught in schools, spoken on the streets, and used in government offices and broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It is argued that delaying the recognition of Kurdish as a dominant language will only lead to further problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Everyone living in the region, including Turks, will eventually have to learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Geopolitical Considerations

The emergence of a homogeneous Kurdish population of 20 million with its own language and intellectuals leads to a class expressing "national hydrology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While forming an independent state is considered difficult due to the international conjuncture and the significant military power disparity with the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, external powers might benefit from a weakening of Turkey's control in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. States that would benefit from the creation of Kurdistan(s) include Russia and Syria, while America would not want to disintegrate its ally, Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

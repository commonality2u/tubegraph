## Introduction to the Armenian Genocide Commemoration

April 24 is commemorated worldwide, particularly in Armenia, as the day of the [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The events of this period are highly emotional, with widespread public remembrance, including walks to the genocide monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

On the night of April 24, 1915, a significant political step occurred immediately before the genocide itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the Ottoman Empire, approximately 235 to 250 prominent Armenian intellectuals were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These included writers, thought leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, and clergymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. They were collected from their homes and sent to places like Ayaş and Çankırı; most were killed and never heard from again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

This operation was a "political collapse operation" designed to silence those who could speak out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, including some who were against extremist Armenian nationalist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Similar operations occurred in other cities like Erzurum, Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas, where leading figures were gathered and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The objective was to eliminate anyone who could voice opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This then escalated into a process of mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## The Act of Denial

The speaker asserts that denying the genocide is either "complete ignorance" of history or "immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He emphasizes that "everyone in the world knows, except for Turkey," including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, that the Armenian Genocide is an obvious fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Speaker's Stance
> Denying the genocide is "either ignorance or immorality, most of the time it is both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The speaker highlights that the Turkish State consciously and systematically designed a genocide project from 1895 onwards, and prepared its infrastructure from 1913, putting it into practice in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Historical Trajectory of Turkish Denial Policy

### Initial Silence (Pre-1975)

Until 1975, the Turkish state maintained a "policy of silence" regarding the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They did not engage in discussions on the issue, believing there was no need to express an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Even during the periods of Atatürk, İnönü, and Menderes, the Turkish state implicitly acknowledged the genocide but chose not to speak about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In the Western world before the 1960s, Turkey generally had a good reputation, and there was a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Shift to Active Denial (Post-1975)

The turning point came in 1965, when the Soviet Union, particularly Soviet Armenia, brought the issue back to the world's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. However, Turkey did not take it seriously and continued its policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

The shift to an active denial policy by Turkey was significantly influenced by the [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | Cyprus operation]] in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. After 1974, Turkey's international standing deteriorated, and its relations with the West fractured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This led to a strong anti-Turkish sentiment in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

Suddenly, an organization called ASALA emerged, initiating attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Simultaneously, the Western press began to highlight the [[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] as one of the 20th century's biggest crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

Turkey responded with what the speaker calls a "stupid policy" of denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This denial, crafted by figures like Cem Coşkun Kırca and Foreign Ministry officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, aimed to assert that "such a thing did not happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. The speaker views this as a "fiasco" from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>, creating a convenient excuse for others to provoke and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.

### Brief Period of Openness (2005-2012)

Between 2005 and 2011-2012, a "window of hope" appeared, suggesting Turkey might abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. During this time, discussions about the genocide emerged in Turkish media, including mainstream and Islamic outlets, with an attitude of "let's face it and let this incident pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. Many prominent figures acknowledged the "terrible thing" that happened to millions of Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>, recognizing it as a "shame" for Turkey that needed to be sorted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. However, this courage was not shown at an official level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

### Current State of Denial

Despite the brief period of openness, Turkey "could not give up" or "show the foresight to step back" from its denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. The speaker notes that denying the Armenian Genocide is not a crime, but it is "immorality or ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Motivations and Consequences of Denial

### [[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | Political and Social Implications]]

The speaker suggests that the genocide and the cleansing of Greek and Assyrian populations profoundly changed the "color" and "composition" of Turkish society, its political transformation, and its psychological and economic basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>. The idea of removing non-Muslim populations was considered and defended since the 1890s, during the time of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:32">[02:13:32]</a>. The speaker argues that the Committee of Union and Progress, initially optimistic in 1908, reverted to this "Abdulhamid project" by 1909-1910, concluding that a "new Turkish Turkey could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>.

The "cleansing" of Greeks was relatively easier due to mutual population exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:43">[02:38:43]</a>, where a large land area (Western Thrace) was available for settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:22">[02:43:22]</a>. However, there was "no place for the Armenians to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>, and deporting them to Russia would mean providing "material to the enemy" during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:32">[02:51:32]</a>. Thus, "massacre" was seen as the only solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>. The speaker contends that hundreds of thousands were killed to prevent future claims for lands and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

### Impact on International Relations

The policy of denial has created a "delicious excuse" to provoke and harm Turkey internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. It has become an "unsolved deadlock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. While the speaker believes Turkey has "overcome this predicament" in a sense (by being "beaten up and ate" without lasting consequences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:15">[02:18:15]</a>, it also prevented the creation of opportunities for new horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:26">[02:34:26]</a>.

### Internal Societal Impact

The speaker asserts that confronting this issue would "relieve" Turkey of a "heavy burden on its back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. He views denial as a "disease" that prevents Turkey from becoming a "healthier society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.
The speaker also notes that the Armenian society has carried a "very heavy hump" for 107 years, viewing the genocide as an "obsession, a mental illness" that acknowledgment could help overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.

### Other Historical Parallels

The speaker broadly discusses that "almost all of the various nation-state models" have "other skeletons in the closets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, citing examples like what Greeks or Bulgarians did, and the expulsion of Turks from Rumelia and Circassians from the Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This forms part of the [[historical_perspectives_on_ethnic_cleansing | historical context of ethnic cleansing]].
The speaker also mentions the Izmir fire (1922) within the context of post-World War I ethnic cleansing and the reshaping of nation-states in Eastern Europe, where "hundreds of thousands of people were expelled from their homes and lands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>.

## The Path Forward

The speaker advocates for an "objective historical analysis" of the genocide, allowing for "all kinds of discussions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. He believes that confronting the facts, while also understanding the concerns and goals of all rational players (Turks, Balkan countries, Western nations like Germany), would lead to a "healthier and calmer discussion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
He stresses that engaging with those who blindly deny the genocide is a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:21">[02:08:21]</a>, because it is impossible to argue with someone who is either ignorant or immoral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:45">[02:57:45]</a>.

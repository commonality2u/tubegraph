The foundation of the Republic of Trkiye in 1923 was established with the hope that "Turkishness" would serve as a unifying element of citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Initially, the definition of Turkishness was broad: "anyone who adopts the Turkish national ideal" was considered Turkish, regardless of their origin, implicitly including non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. During the 1920s, up until 1932, the [[central_asianism_and_its_impact_on_turkish_national_identity | Central Asian theory]], which posits that Turks originated from Central Asia, was not present in official state publications or in any materials related to Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This inclusive approach characterized the dominant ideology of the early Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Radical Ideological Shift (Post-1930)

A radical and rapid shift in national ideology occurred after 1930, particularly from 1932-1933 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. During the winter of 1932-1933, a history book was reportedly written, preparing a "racist theory" that claimed Turks originated from Central Asia and founded all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. From 1933 onwards, this became the official ideology, implemented through the First Turkish Language Congress and First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

Three potential reasons are identified for this radical ideological transformation:

1.  ### Influence of European Political Models
    The "winds blowing from Europe" played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. In 1933, Hitler's rise to power in Germany altered global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. While the Soviet and Mussolini models were considered in 1923, the Mussolini model, emphasizing a society united under a single leader's will to achieve reforms (summarized as "Italianism"), was particularly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. From 1933, racism gained ground in Europe, with Nazism seen as the wave of the future and the idea of "purity" dominating world discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Trkiye immediately absorbed these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

2.  ### Re-emergence of Previous Cadres
    The [[central_asianism_and_its_impact_on_turkish_national_identity | Central Asianism theory]], popular among imported cadres like the Turkish Hearth in the 1910s, had been silenced after 1922-1923 during the War of Independence and the early Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. The Turkism of the Union and Progress was "defeated" and figures like Ziya Gökalp were silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. From 1932 onwards, these previously silent cadres suddenly re-emerged, suggesting a change in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

3.  ### Perceived Inadequacy of Founding Ideology
    The third reason was the perception that the Republic's founding ideology was "not enough to hold the country together politically," lacking convincing power or popular appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. It only resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments, failing to gain a response from wider society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The regime entered turmoil in 1930-1931, marked by events like the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a return to Turkism, specifically a statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian, and racist Turkist ideology, would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Implications and Outcomes

The statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian ideology of the Republic's founding phase and the racist Turkist ideology implemented in the 1930s are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The shift aimed to assimilate groups like the Kurds, with the hope of "crushing them" in one generation or "assimilating them in two generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This assimilation project, however, did not succeed as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The Turkish state's "fascist dynamism" from the 1920s and early 1930s loosened, preventing the full execution of the assimilation plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. A significant migration occurred from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, as Turkish classes and the upper class gradually left the region, sending their children to schools in the central cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

### Comparative Perspective
Similar "stupidity and immorality" regarding minority policies and the invention of artificial [[history_and_nationalism_in_trkiye | national histories]] are observable in other countries in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Research into Armenian national history and historiography, for instance, reveals similar patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

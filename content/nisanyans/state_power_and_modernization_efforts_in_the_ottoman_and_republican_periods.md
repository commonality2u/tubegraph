This article explores the complex interplay of state power and [[modernization_efforts_in_turkish_history|modernization efforts]] in both the Ottoman and Republican periods of Turkish history. It delves into the strategies employed by leaders to maintain and re-establish state authority, the challenges they faced, and the lasting impact of their decisions on [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey|modern Turkey]].

## The Imperative of Re-establishing State Power

A fundamental assumption in statesmanship, particularly during periods of collapse or existential threat, is the need to re-establish the power of a collapsed state and protect the power and life of its leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This principle applies to figures like Abdülhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who, at critical junctures, found themselves in situations where losing power meant losing their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.

## Ottoman Modernization Struggle and Decline

The [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization|modernization struggle]] that the Ottomans pursued for a hundred years ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The traditional form of Ottoman administration largely ended around 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>. Sultan Abdülhamid's 33-year reign is characterized as having stopped the flow of a stream, causing the country to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. By 1908, continuity was almost nonexistent, and a generation had experienced a period of stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. The prominent cadres who emerged were too young to remember the past and had little respect for traditional institutions, including the Sultanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>.

The [[historical_analysis_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_decline|Ottoman Empire's decline]], or "secular decline," ongoing since the 1600s, continued into the Republican period without significant reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. The country gradually slid down in global rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

## The Republican Era: Foundations and Controversies

### Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's Policies and Outcomes
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's policies were rooted in two clear goals: to save and rebuild the bankrupt, collapsed state, and to protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>. He was successful in this mission, remaining in power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. His actions included:
*   Creating a national excitement, even if perceived as artificial, in a country with a large immigrant population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.
*   Using stories of homeland, nation, and military victories to galvanize ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   Employing political terror and intrigue, a tradition inherited from the Committee of Union and Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Taking counter-deterrent measures to prevent state disintegration in 1926 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   Attempting a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism in international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   Capitalizing on France's weakness to take a piece of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the radical transformation needed to make the system permanent in the long term was not achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. The project of raising the country to the level of leading contemporary nations is seen as a "complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.

### Criticisms and Controversies
Questions are raised about the rationality and ethical implications of certain actions attributed to Atatürk after 1929-1930, described as signs of "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>:
*   Language and history theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
*   The Dersim massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   The liquidation of İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   The purchase of the Savarona yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> and decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The Savarona yacht incident is further described as one of the most despicable and pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>, driven by pathological megalomania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>.

The difficulty of protecting oneself from the corrupting effect of absolute power is emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### The İzmir Assassination Attempt and Purges
The İzmir assassination attempt in 1926, whether real or an excuse to intimidate the opposition, is described as a "blessing from God" that was used to purge old Committee of Union and Progress cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>. Figures like Finance Minister Cavit Bey, Vasıf Bey, and Kara Kemal Bey, who were crucial in financing and organizing the National Struggle, were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. All seven individuals who signed the Amasya Declaration with Mustafa Kemal were tried with the death penalty, including Kazım Karabekir, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and Rauf Orbay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. This purge is likened to Stalin's initiatives in the Soviet Union or the Night of the Long Knives in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.

## Kemalism as an Ideology

Kemalism is presented as an "arrogant" and "insulting" ideology that became the main axis of Turkish political language, a shared responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. It's described as a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a> and a "sect" that rejects Islam while watering itself down as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

### Critiques of Kemalism's Legacy
*   **Inability to understand the populace**: Those afflicted with this "disease" are incapable of understanding the rights of Turks or establishing emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This leads to ignorance on crucial issues like the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding modern history**: They are unable to comprehend [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey|Turkey's modern history]] or discuss it sensibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Authoritarianism**: The idea of a "new and democratic Kemalism" is dismissed as a "complete dream," as it's seen as absurd for a totalitarian dictator of the 1930s to become a more democratic symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.
*   **Icon Worship**: Government offices in Turkey, from the smallest to the largest, are depicted as being decorated with symbols of a religious ceremony, requiring a holy icon to be at the bedside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. This icon worship enables state representatives to disregard normal human logic and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

## Modernization and Westernization Drive

[[Ottoman Empires modernization and westernization|Turkey's westernization drive]] has been a long-standing state tradition since Byzantium, driven by a consensus among the ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>. Since the 1830s, Western Europe was adopted as a reference point, influencing art, state structure, and military organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>. Turkey has historically been the "most open face of the Islamic world to the West," with innovations originating from the West after the 1500s—such as the printing house, telescope, new military organization, and paper money—first arriving in the Islamic world through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:00">[45:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>.

The [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization|westernization project]] was pursued under the guise of European Union membership until 2011, aiming to adopt EU institutions, democracy, and freedom of the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>. However, when the EU itself appeared to be collapsing, the desire for membership waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:00">[36:49:00]</a>.

## Current State and Future Outlook

The current situation is characterized by a "helplessness" and lack of alternatives to existing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:23:00">[37:23:00]</a>. Mainstream political parties and institutional structures are seen as inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>. There's a strong sentiment that a revolution is needed to bring forth new ideas and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. Across the Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, there is a belief that the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.

The prospect of returning to a "Kemal culture" is deemed a very distant possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>. The modernizing class has not benefited the country and has failed to achieve its stated goals of raising Turkey to a contemporary civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Consequently, Turkey has entered a search for a new route, new staffing, and a new structure, a search that is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

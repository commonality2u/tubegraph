A common assertion is that a 1400-year-old Quran in a university is 99.5% similar to today's copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, the notion of a 1400-year-old Quran from a university is described as a subject "obscured with so many fallacies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. [[controversies_and_fallacies_around_the_qurans_compilation | Contradictory information]] suggests there is no serious data on how much of the Quran was written down, where, or in what script before 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. What exists are "a series of fallacies, a series of half-truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Development of Arabic Script

The Arabic script itself was first codified in the 680s CE, during the time of Caliph Abdul Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This codification, or "invention" of the Arabic script, was done specifically for the purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

In the earlier period, during the time of Muhammad and the 60 years following his death, the Arabic script was rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It consisted only of some graffiti and brief scribbles, typically 3 to 5 words of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This early form of Arabic script did not include dots or movements (diacritical marks), making it a distorted version useful only for taking notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

At that time, there were no literary works or letters written in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The prevailing written language of the Middle East, understood by most cultured people, was [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts | Syriac script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This script was utilized by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. During Muhammad's era, the idea that Arabic, then primarily a tribal language, could be written down did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Compilation and Early Transmission

The claim that a commission was established during Muhammad's time and later during the time of Hz. Osman to write down the Quran is considered a fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This narrative was concocted approximately 180 years after the events, during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The reason for this fabrication is rooted in psychological uneasiness regarding the fact that the Quran was not written during Muhammad's time and was compiled much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The narrative of it being written in Osman's time aimed to mitigate this discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Scientifically and objectively, current information suggests the Quran was compiled around 680 CE, during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Before this compilation, the transmission was primarily oral, described as "extremely divine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. People memorized verses and recited them in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, there is no reliable data on the authenticity of this oral transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Regional Variations and Standardization

When the Quran reached the stage of being written down, there were distinct traditions in various cities and regions, including Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Individuals held different versions of verses, stating, "We don't know that verse like that, we know it like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

These differing traditions were ultimately suppressed by the order of Hajjaj, resulting in the creation of a standardized text that aligned with the political interests of the Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This standardization occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

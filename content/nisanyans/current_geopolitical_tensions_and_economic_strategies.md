## US-China Relations and Global Economic Shifts

Recent diplomatic engagements highlight the complex and potentially volatile state of [[impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_global_powers | global power dynamics]]. Notably, Henry Kissinger, at 100 years old, undertook a 10-hour plane journey to China for a serious negotiation concerning the fate of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Kissinger is highly trusted by the Chinese administration, having been the architect of peace between China and the United States in 1972-73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He has been a strong critic of America's [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia policy]] since early 2022, calling the forcibly started war in Ukraine a "major diplomatic blunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He continues to warn about the dangers of a radical deterioration in relations with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The primary arena of conflict between the United States and China currently appears to be economic, specifically regarding the dumping of dollar bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. China, as a major holder of trillions of dollars in American debt, has systematically begun to divest itself of these bonds over the past year, a process many other countries have also initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This divestment is expected to lead to a massive financial crisis and the collapse of the American dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

An emerging alliance comprising [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]], China, Brazil, [[middle_eastern_geopolitics_and_alliances | Saudi Arabia]], and [[middle_eastern_geopolitics_and_alliances | Iran]] is systematically working towards this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Such an action, collapsing the dollar, would be unacceptable to the United States and is considered a "real cause for war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Global Military Structures and Power Concentration

The idea of global demilitarization and a universal army, governed by international law, is viewed critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. States are fundamentally organizations of violence, and their power is kept in check by the existence of other equally powerful organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Concentrating all power in a single entity would create an unprecedented apparatus of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, as "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a group within the United States, influenced by concepts like Star Trek's Galactic Confederation and Fukuyama's "end of history," envisioned a universal administration and the eternal era of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. These cadres gained power from the late 1990s, ruthlessly eliminating obstacles to consolidate their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. The pursuit of such absolute power transforms individuals into "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, leading to a situation where the United States and its alliance are seen as a disaster from which humanity needs urgent saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

## [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]] and Geopolitical Dynamics

There is limited information about the internal aspects of the Russian uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>. While there were claims of a rebellion, characterized by a helicopter being shot down and casualties, Yevgeny Prigozhin eventually backed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>. Despite an apparent act of rebellion during wartime, Prigozhin was not executed, but exiled, and then surprisingly returned to Russia for a meeting with Putin and his entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:33">[01:41:33]</a>. This situation suggests that Putin's position has not been weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.

Putin's slow, deliberate strategy in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine conflict]], while possibly pre-designed and conscious, has tested the patience of many within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. He faces criticism not for fighting, but for not fighting aggressively enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>. This approach is likened to the Russian chess school, where opponents struggle to understand the strategy until a very advanced stage of the game, only to realize the entire field has been taken over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>.

From a broader perspective, [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]]'s inevitable goal should be integration with Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. Germany and [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]]'s economies are highly complementary, and close cooperation between them is considered essential for serious economic development and peace in the "old world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.

## Colonialism and its Legacy

Colonialism, despite claims of benefit by some, is overwhelmingly viewed negatively by the colonized peoples themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>. In countries formerly under British and French rule, such as African nations, India, and [[middle_east_political_tensions_and_scenarios | Middle Eastern countries]], there is no consensus among intelligent segments that colonial administration was beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>. While some acknowledge contributions like the establishment of railways in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:29">[01:42:29]</a>, the overall reality of colonialism is far from black and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

In India, British rule can be divided into two periods:
1.  **18th Century:** Characterized by "disgrace" and "robbery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>. India was likely the richest country in the world at the time, but the British "destroyed" and "ruined" it through armed robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. This period was dominated by a private company operating on behalf of the English ruling classes, not the British government directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.
2.  **After 1850:** The British government took direct control and began to invest in infrastructure and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>. The goal was still economic exploitation ("invest 100 liras... get 200 liras back") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>, but this involved educating locals and establishing a new education system to create a loyal, English-speaking administrative class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:06">[01:46:06]</a>. However, this education inadvertently fostered anti-colonial movements, as locals applied Western values of human rights and self-governance to their own situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:36">[01:46:36]</a>. Leaders of anti-colonial movements were often Western-educated individuals who absorbed these modern ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:58">[01:47:58]</a>.

## The Turkish Case: Mandate and the Nablus Defeat

The idea of a British mandate for Turkey was never politically feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. Instead, after the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, an American mandate for the new Turkish nation-state was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. This would involve American consultants in ministries, directing tax policies, and re-establishing the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. Turkey, unlike Iraq and Syria, had centuries of statehood, political integrity, and an established governing elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. However, the United States ultimately rejected the mandate proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.

A highly problematic and mysterious historical event is Mustafa Kemal's role in the Ottoman Army's defeat at Nablus in September 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Just 10 days before the British attack, Mustafa Kemal was sent to command the 7th Army, and effectively took command of the entire Yıldırım Army Group, superseding the German commander Liman von Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>. The entire army then surrendered without a fight, with only the headquarters managing to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

This swift collapse suggests a "staged fight" or a pre-arranged defeat, possibly a necessary measure for the Ottoman state to protect its interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>. The Ottoman army was exhausted and without resources, and a British victory was inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>. If an agreement was made, it likely involved removing the Germans, secretly negotiating with the British for favorable terms, and ensuring the minimal loss of life for the remaining Ottoman forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

The outcome of this "surrender operation" is believed to be today's Turkey-Syria border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>. This suggests a secret agreement where the Ottomans ceded Palestine and Syria (to the British and French respectively) in exchange for the British not advancing beyond the Turkish ethnic border (Kilis area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. This secret agreement would have been necessary to avoid angering allies like France and to prevent accusations of treason within Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. The lack of information about these negotiations in modern Turkish and British historiography is considered suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>.

## Western Societal Decline and the Role of Religion

There is a concern that Western society, particularly in the last three years (referring to [[2023_global_economic_and_political_events | 2023 events]]), has embarked on a path that "cannot be explained by any rational thing" and is indicative of "madness" and a "period of suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:25">[01:48:25]</a>. This is linked to the West's abandonment of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>.

Religion, beyond its spiritual aspects, historically functioned as a societal tradition with memory, a disciplined life model, and a system of theories explaining the world (a "scientific doctrine" in the general sense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. However, in the last 500, and especially the last 200, years, religion's informational claims have been severely undermined by the emergence of alternative, more logical "information theories" offered by science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>. Western science has produced a new cosmology that clearly defeated existing religious cosmologies, leading to a loss of credibility for religions that couldn't adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.

Eastern religions (Chinese and Indian) have shown more flexibility in adapting to the modern world due to their less "bookish" nature and more fluid theological structures regarding knowledge and the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26">[01:53:26]</a>.

Despite losing other functions, church institutions in countries like England and Germany historically provided a moral counterpoint to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:22">[01:55:22]</a>. However, during the COVID-19 crisis, European churches largely "went completely bankrupt," showing no resistance to state measures like closing churches or imposing mask mandates, instead siding with authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:48">[01:55:48]</a>. This complete collapse of institutional religion is seen as a heavy blow that contributes to society's perceived "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>. The collapse of the Western world is a reality that is perceived in Turkey with a delay, but will become evident in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>.

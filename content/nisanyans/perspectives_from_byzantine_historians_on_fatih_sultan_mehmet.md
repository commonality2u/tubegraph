Understanding historical figures like [[fatih_sultan_mehmets_intellectual_reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] requires a critical look at the sources available, especially considering the political and diplomatic context of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While there is limited information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet from Turkish Ottoman sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, more detailed insights can be gleaned from Byzantine historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Limitations of Ottoman Sources
Ottoman official histories, such as those written by Asikpaşazade or later works from the 18th century, present a somewhat ambiguous view of Fatih Sultan Mehmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Especially towards the latter part of his reign, Fatih was not a universally beloved Sultan and was often associated with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He reportedly suppressed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property, and executing many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. His 30-year rule was largely defined by constant warfare, with annual declarations of war on different fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Key Byzantine Historians
The two primary Byzantine sources for information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet are Halkondylis and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Both historians were contemporaries of Fatih, personally met him, and were aware of the conditions within his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Their writings often contain praises for the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Political Agendas of Byzantine Historians
It is crucial for historians to recognize that these Byzantine accounts carried political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These historians had close ties with Italian states like Genoa and Venice and were well-informed about the political landscape in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Their writings were likely aimed at defending Italian interests, establishing alliances, or fostering rapprochements between the Ottoman Empire and Italian powers within the context of the evolving global balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The Ottoman Empire was deeply involved in complex diplomatic relations with various Italian states that were often at war with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Portrayal of Fatih Sultan Mehmet
Byzantine historians employed clichéd expressions to portray Fatih Sultan Mehmet as similar to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. They claimed he knew Latin and Italian and was knowledgeable about Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Historian's Approach
> A good historian's reaction to such claims is not to question whether they are true, but rather to question *why* these statements were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Statements about sultans and state administrators are often unreliable, whether they speak in favor or against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. They tend to be "ready-made" or clichéd phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. For example, a statement like "I have personally seen that he prays to God in secret" despite claims of irreligiosity, or that he was a poet and personally made architectural drawings for his projects, are examples of such quoted sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It is impossible to know their veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

It is challenging to obtain an objective and realistic picture of rulers from historical literature, especially after centuries, as information and vocabulary about state leaders are often disseminated through filtered channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Türkiye's history is viewed not as a series of isolated eras, but as a continuous, flowing process that has been ongoing since at least 1453, possibly even longer, reflecting a deep state tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. The establishment of the Republic in 1923 is considered an "important episode" within this broader historical development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## The Republic: An Episode, Not a Break
Contrary to expectations of grand celebrations for its 100th anniversary, the Republic's centenary was largely "ordinary and unimportant" in official policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that the Republic is seen as a continuation rather than a radical break from the past.

> "The 100th anniversary of the Republic does not mean much for the country as a whole. I thought about this incident and I came to the conclusion that this was the right policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

Similar to how France transitioned from a kingdom to a republic, or Russia from a monarchy to different regimes, the "continuities outweigh differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. These nations remained fundamentally themselves despite significant political transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Similarly, for Türkiye, the Republic Period is an "episode" like the Abdulhamid period or periods of rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## Enduring Identity and Institutions
The name of the country, "Türkiye," has consistently been used by foreigners, regardless of the official state name, such as the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This highlights a continuous national identity that transcends political structures.

The state's historical narrative and its perception of itself demonstrate a clear continuity, linking historical figures like Fatih, Yavuz, and Abdulhamid to Mustafa Kemal and Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

Furthermore, key state institutions like the Turkish Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, the Gendarmerie Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, the Police Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, land registry records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, the General Directorate of Mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, and population administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a> exhibit "obvious continuity," not breaking despite regime changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. The Republic of Turkey is seen as a "revised version of the Ottoman State" adapting to new conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

The collective identity of the people has also largely remained consistent. Historically, this populace referred to themselves as Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, a term later shifted to "Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. These two identities largely overlap, representing "two different guises of the same cluster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Notably, external observers, such as Armenians, Greeks, French, Italians, and English, consistently referred to the Ottoman Muslims as "Turkish," even if they were Bosniaks, Albanians, or Lazs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Legal and Administrative Legacy
The ruling cadres of the Republic were largely a continuation of the old state's elite, with individuals who graduated from the previous regime's schools and served in its armies transitioning to the new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Laws, too, showed continuity; Ottoman laws had already undergone significant reforms and modernization based on European models since the 1840s, including the commercial, criminal, and civil procedure codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. The Republic also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Many traditions, customs, and habits from the Ottoman period persisted into the Republican era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

Turkish continued as the dominant language, with significant reforms in its usage style from the 1930s onwards, but writers from the Abdulhamid period were still understandable with minor stylistic adjustments until the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

## Sociological and Administrative Shifts
One of the most significant changes attributed to the Republic, and indeed a continuation of processes starting with the Tanzimat reforms, was the shift in the social structure. In the Ottoman State, the Muslim/Turkish segment was the "Sovereign Nation" in a multi-national order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. With the Republic, this structure was radically transformed, aiming to consolidate the "Sovereign Society" into a single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. This "process of cleaning non-Muslims" from the population began in the 19th century and continued through the Republican period until the 1980s, fundamentally altering the country's sociological landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

Another continuity was the expansion of the state's duties and the corresponding need for a growing, diversifying bureaucratic staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. This global trend, seen in monarchies like Iran and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>, meant a vast increase in literate individuals integrated into state cadres, from an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. These new administrative elites, often from provincial backgrounds, became loyal supporters of the Republican regime, as it provided them with opportunities previously unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.

### Limited Revolutionary Impact
Despite the "revolutionary excitement" of the 1920s and 30s, fueled by the collapse of the old regime and a global desire for renewal post-World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>, the actual results in Türkiye were largely "much talk and little action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. This contrasts with more radical transformations in Russia under Catherine and Stalin, who built new cities and institutions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.

The reforms in Türkiye were deemed "superficial" with insufficient cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. Many early Republican founders acquired wealth through the "elimination of non-Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>, prioritizing their gains over deep societal change. The initial revolutionary idealism, largely driven by Mustafa Kemal Pasha and a small core, faded after his death, with administrators reverting to traditional thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>.

## Change in Head of State Election
The most distinct change brought by the Republic was the method of electing the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. Previously, hereditary succession (father to son) was the norm, believed to ensure stability in governing a complex state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>. However, this model collapsed globally after World War I, with monarchies in Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary being overthrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. China also replaced its 2000-year monarchy with a republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.

This shift reflected a "fashion of the age" and new social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:00">[39:49:00]</a>. The Republic introduced the principle that the head of state could be chosen by elites and approved by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>. However, in Türkiye, this didn't always translate into regular, rotational leadership, with Mustafa Kemal Pasha serving for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[41:13:00]</a>.

The actual "real-world results" of this change in management technique were not seen as significantly different compared to other regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. Metrics like decreased child mortality, increased life expectancy, population growth, improved public health, higher literacy rates, and urbanization were universal developments in the 20th century, observed across monarchies and republics alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>.

> "The answer to the question of whether these are the results of the Republic is No. Because there are nearly 200 states in the world. These things have happened in all of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>.

Japan, a monarchy, experienced similar development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:03:00">[47:03:00]</a>. These changes stem from broader global trends like the "new state understanding," increased state influence, developments in transportation and communication, and the astronomical need for educated personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>.

## Notable Historical Events and Discussions

### The Ankara Capital Decision
Ankara was not "created from nothing" as a capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>. It was one of Central Anatolia's three largest cities, comparable to Kayseri and Konya, and possibly the most developed in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. An ancient city since Roman times, Ankara's selection as a base for the national struggle was influenced by its economic assets, particularly its mohair monopoly, and the arrival of the Anatolian railway in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.

### The Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)
The victory against Greece in the 1919-1922 war is often seen as a significant achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:33:00">[57:33:00]</a>. However, the speaker argues that given Türkiye's significantly larger population and economy, and its long military tradition compared to Greece's nascent one, the outcome was predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:11:00">[58:11:00]</a>. The true significance lay in the fact that Britain and France were driving the Greek invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>. The Turkish side's serious engagement stemmed from the uncertainty of British involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>. The war was framed as a national epic and Mustafa Kemal Pasha's personal success, crucial for laying the foundations of his political future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. This political narrative served to bolster his path to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### Çanakkale (Gallipoli) Campaign (1915)
The Allied naval operation at Çanakkale (Dardanelles) in March 1915 failed, leading to a subsequent land invasion on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This "crazy project," driven by "extreme arrogance and pride" (Winston Churchill's idea), aimed to capture Istanbul within 48 hours to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Another objective was to prevent a potential Russian capture of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. Landing in Izmir was not considered viable due to the long distance to Istanbul and the need for a massive, unavailable army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. The Çanakkale offensive was an opportunistic "quick, cut and run" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## The 1990s in Türkiye
The 1990s were a period of mixed feelings in Türkiye, influenced by the global rise of liberalism from the mid-1980s. An "optimistic perspective" dominated middle and upper classes, driven by the idea of Türkiye's integration with the West and the European Union, with borders opening and international travel becoming easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. However, this optimism slowly gave way to pessimism in the mid-90s, with a resurgence of the belief that "nothing will change in this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>.

The [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish issue]] escalated significantly around 1993, leading to a terror campaign, deportation policies in Eastern provinces, and the destruction of thousands of villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. Dozens of [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish]] intellectuals were killed. The military, which had been withdrawing, re-entered the country's political life with renewed "tyranny and oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. This "dark period" eventually led to the explosion of the existing political party system, from which the Justice and Development Party emerged around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>.

## Interest in Niche Historical Topics
The intense public interest in seemingly niche historical topics, such as migrations and village histories, stems from a pervasive feeling that "standard discourses about identity consist of such stupid lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. People perceive a "gap between what they heard from their grandfathers and what they learned in school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>.

The official national ideology and education curriculum are criticized for denying the country's real, complex history, which includes "ethnic and cultural divisions," "clashes and envy" between groups like Arabs and Kurds, Laz and Chileans, Circassians and Yörüks, or Alevis and Sunnis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>. Uncovering these local, human stories, and "opening the curtain of the official narrative" is seen as a "revolutionary service" that shakes the established narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.

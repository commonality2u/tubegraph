A discussion on the differences between Catholic and Orthodox approaches to modernity and their sociological and cultural roles reveals distinct paths and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>.

## Defining "Reactionary" in Religious Contexts
The term "reactionary" in this context is defined as bigotry, obsessiveness in beliefs, and an exclusionary or hostile attitude towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

## Sociological and Class Differences
A fundamental [[differences_between_religious_and_secular_individuals_in_society | sociological and class difference]] exists between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

### The Catholic Church
For at least the last 500 years, since the 16th century's Council of Trent and possibly even earlier with St. Dominic in the 13th century, the Catholic Church has asserted an intellectual claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.

> [!info] Intellectual Claim
> Catholic clergy typically represent the educated segment of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. They often wear glasses, are clean-shaven, and receive secular education alongside their religious and theological studies, including history, philosophy, and sociology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. This positions the Catholic priest as representing a more elite segment of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

For centuries, the Church maintained an extremely powerful position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. However, since the 1960s, it has entered a terrible decline, losing strongholds one by one, including Ireland and Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>. Its sociological roots made it closer to the secular, liberal, educated segments of Western societies, making it more susceptible to their currents of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>.

During the Vatican Council in the 1960s, the Catholic Church modernized and discarded many traditional structures and customs, believing it was crucial for survival in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. This was considered a significant error, leading people to drift away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>.

Despite later attempts under Popes John Paul and Benedict to uphold traditional principles, particularly regarding family values, a significant turning point occurred around 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>. The current Pope's complete surrender to the secular liberal worldview of the Western world, including green-lighting gay marriage and submitting to dominant thought on COVID vaccines, is seen as critically damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. This has sparked an uprising within the Catholic world, particularly in America, England, and France, with many rebelling against the current hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. The Catholic Church, in its current organization, is considered terminally ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

### The Orthodox Church
The Orthodox Church, prevalent in Eastern Europe (including Russia, Serbia, and Bulgaria), has adopted a different stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>.

> [!info] Resistance to Modernity
> The Orthodox Church has made almost no concessions to modernity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. It has remained largely closed to the fashions and trends that have spread from Western countries, especially Anglo-Saxon ones, over the last 30-50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>.

This resistance has allowed it to maintain its prestige among common people to a great extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>. Unlike the Catholic clergy, the Orthodox priest is seen as "one of the people" â€“ poor, often found drinking coffee with the common folk in village coffeehouses, or consoling a widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.

The Orthodox Church continues to function as an institution that preserves traditions and customs rather than purely ideological or political attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. Core customs such as baptism, marriage, and funerals continue with full force in Orthodox countries, unlike in Western countries where baptism has almost disappeared and marriage has collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. These ceremonies remain important turning points in people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.

The role of ideology plays a fundamental part in shaping [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkey's political landscape]], with historical currents such as Kemalism, nationalism, and Islamism continually influencing societal and governmental structures.

## Understanding Historical Ideologies and State Power

The speaker discusses the nature of state power and leadership, using Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as a primary example. The basic assumptions for any leader in a collapsed state are to re-establish the state's power and protect their own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This perspective is applied to Mustafa Kemal, Sultan Abdülhamid, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who are seen as leaders who "crossed the bridges to the other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, meaning they succeeded in their core mission of establishing and maintaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that governing a state is more of a science than an art, bound by objective laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even with radical dreams, power has a logic that must be adhered to for a leader to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Kemalism: Foundations, Evolution, and Critique

Mustafa Kemal's primary goals were to save and rebuild the bankrupt, collapsed state and protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. He was successful in establishing a new state and maintaining power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. His methods included creating national excitement (even if fake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, employing intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, and utilizing the "tradition of political terror" inherited from the Union and Progress organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

However, the speaker also heavily critiques Kemalism:
*   **Controversial Actions:** Actions like the theories of language and history, the Dersim massacre, the liquidation of İnönü, the purchase of the Savarona yacht, and living in Dolmabahçe Palace are questioned as potential "signs of madness" after 1929-1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The Savarona yacht incident is specifically highlighted as "one of the most despicable and most pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   **Corrupting Power:** It is difficult to protect oneself from the corrupting effect of absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Political Language:** Mustafa Kemal is seen as having an undeniable share in making arrogance and insult the main axis of [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkish political language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **"Hakime Arrogance":** Kemalism is described as a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It rejects Islam and positions itself as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, but its deepest dimension is "Hakime arrogance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, meaning "we are right, the other is sharpened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This makes Kemalists incapable of understanding the rights of Turks or connecting emotionally with them, leading to "ignorance that reaches the level of stupidity" on issues like the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It also makes it "completely impossible" for them to understand [[public_perception_and_media_influence_on_turkeys_political_landscape | Turkey's modern history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Failure of Modernization:** Despite its foundational goals, the system established by Kemalism failed to achieve the radical transformation needed to make it permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. The project of raising the country to the level of contemporary leading nations was a "complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, and the "secular decline" of the Ottoman Empire continued into the Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Icon Worship:** The pervasive presence of Mustafa Kemal's symbols in government offices across [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]] is described as a "religious ceremony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, allowing officials to discard normal human logic and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This "disgusting attitude" gives civil servants who "take the icon of the state behind him" the power to crush those who reason with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **"Democratic Kemalism" is a dream:** The idea of a "new and democratic Kemalism" as proposed by some young secular academics is considered "completely a dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. These academics are seen as marginalized, out of touch, and deeply hating the majority of the population, thereby losing their political future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. The speaker argues that a "totalitarian dictator of the 1930s becoming a more democratic symbol is an absurd idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### Nationalism and Its Role

Nationalism is identified as a "tool of populism all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, which glorifies a people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The speaker suggests that those who talk about how wonderful "our people are" and try to provoke them through demagogy are usually called nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Islam as a Unifying Ideal

The speaker observes that the process of adopting Islam as the official state ideology in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] is "not a process that can be easily reversed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. In the absence of other unifying alternatives, Islam has emerged as an "Idea that unites the country, defining the country and shows a target to the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This is framed within a global context where existing political systems and parties are seen as inadequate, and there is a need for a new alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Across the Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, there is a belief that the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

## Elite Culture and External Influences

[[Alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] has a long-standing state tradition of an elite ruling class, which has adopted Western Europe as a reference point since the 1830s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This class changed its art, state structure, and army structure to align with Western models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

[[Turkish_political_climate_and_elections | Turkey]] has historically been the "most open face of the Islamic world to the West at every stage of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>, being the first in the Islamic world to adopt Western innovations such as the printing press, telescope, new military organization, and paper money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

The speaker highlights a significant shift in [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | Turkey's demographics]]: until just before the Republic, 25% of the population and over 30% of the economic structure were non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

The Ottoman administration, in its traditional form, effectively ended in 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. The 33-year reign of Abdülhamid created a period where life "froze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, leaving little in the name of continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. The cadres of 1908 were too young to remember the past and lacked respect for institutions, including the Sultanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. The empire's transformation from an empire to a nation-state involved significant losses and a desperate attempt by remaining Turkish and Kurdish populations to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. This change was not unique to [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkey]], as many ancient dynasties collapsed globally around the same time (e.g., Russian Tsardom, Austro-Hungarian, German, Iranian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>, indicating that [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] is not disconnected from global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Future Ideological Directions

The speaker suggests that [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] has entered a search for a "new route, a new staffing, a new structure," and this search will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Older ideological models like Turgut Özal's globalist-capitalist-American model failed to suit [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkey's]] "vein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. Similarly, the "westernization project" under the guise of the European Union collapsed around 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.

The current global political climate, especially in the Western world, is rapidly heading towards an "explosion," with existing thought systems, political parties, and institutional structures being "inadequate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. People are unhappy with existing alternatives, and there is a need for a "revolution" and a "glimmer of hope" for societies to rally behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This applies equally to [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

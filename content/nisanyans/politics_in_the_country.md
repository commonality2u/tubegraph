From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker acknowledges that [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | politics]] is currently the sole topic in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, yet expresses a personal dislike for discussing it, feeling it "gets on people's nerves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He dismisses current discussions about figures like Meral Hanım and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as "topics that wander at the bottom of inferiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Political Censorship and Persecution

The speaker discusses filmmaker Emir Kusturica, who was once considered the world's most fashionable filmmaker in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. His career was reportedly destroyed after he "loudly voiced the West's brutality and immorality regarding Yugoslavia and especially the [[politics_and_history_of_bosnia | Bosnia War]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. As a result, he was "erased from public memory," his movies were not shown, and his awards were taken back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Kusturica subsequently retired to a village he built in the Serbian part of [[politics_and_history_of_bosnia | Bosnia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Views on the Gülen Community and Political Strategy

Addressing criticisms for engaging with "Gülenists" in an interview, the speaker asserts a principle of speaking to anyone who asks for his opinion, including Armenian state television, the PKK, or the CIE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He holds "mixed feelings about the Gülen Community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, neither supporting nor opposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

He acknowledges the difficulty in assessing a project aiming "to seize the state through a secret organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, noting that its alleged backing by the US intelligence agency "seriously reduces the value of this movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While unable to approve of the movement's methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, he questions how else [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | political power]] can be built in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The speaker argues that the staff and mentality governing [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] since 2016 are "not better" than previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, and condemns the "vile policy of oppression" implemented by trampling on law and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. He finds it morally wrong to criticize the Gülen Community while this oppression continues, viewing it as hypocrisy to "kick a fallen person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He describes the widespread hostility towards Gülen as a common denominator between the government and the self-proclaimed opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Collapse of the Ottoman Empire

The speaker discusses the question of when the Ottoman Empire officially collapsed. He pinpoints the abolition of the Ottoman government and its liquidation as clearly having a date, likely around November 2 or 3, 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This occurred shortly after the conquest of Izmir and the signing of the Mudanya Armistice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Ankara army detachments, led by Refet Pasha, arrived in Istanbul, informed ministries of their closure, and the official gazette ceased publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. The Prime Minister, Tevfik Pasha, was notified of the end of his duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>, and the Sultan was forced to leave on a British ship from Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>.

He clarifies that the gradual disappearance of the Ottoman government can be traced from September 1919 onwards, after the Sivas Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. The Ankara regime took control across Anatolia, removing uncooperative governors and seizing military garrisons, effectively controlling all of Anatolia except Istanbul and its immediate surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. The Istanbul government under Damat Ferit Pasha became incapacitated, with a telegraph embargo cutting off communication with Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. The Grand National Assembly's convening in Ankara led to Damat Ferit's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>, replaced by short-lived military governments and then Tevfik Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

## Academic Leftism and Societal Role

The speaker explores why academics lean left, attributing it to the left's core idea of prioritizing societal interests over individual ones, especially those of the weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. He states that the intellectual class is "obliged to defend this perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.

Historically, the ideal was for the "cultural elite, the moral elite, the scientific elite" to remain free from worldly interests and dependencies, sometimes even forbidding marriage for university members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. However, modern universities have "undergone a strange deformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>, primarily training "qualified civil servants" (robots following instructions) or the unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>. He suggests closing these institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

## Interest in Politics and the "Us vs. Them" Mentality

The speaker argues that for most people, interest in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | politics]] is akin to supporting a football team, serving a "natural need" for fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. This manifests as an "us and them" mentality, with little interest in solutions or strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. Those who genuinely engage with [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | politics]] to find solutions are often "heavily insulted and stoned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a> by the majority.

## Despair for the Future

The speaker admits to being in despair about the world's course, especially since early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. He has "no hope or faith that it will get better" unless a "huge bloodshed orgy occurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. He believes this applies to both [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>.

## Herd Mentality and Thought Leaders

People's engagement with trending topics, like reality shows, is attributed to a "herd mentality," a strong desire to do what everyone else is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. This is likened to historical theological debates, where everyone wanted to be part of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>. The speaker questions how "thought leaders" condemn humanity to such "misery and smallness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>.

## Revolutions and Social Change

The speaker states that [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | revolutions]] always start somewhere and spread, as they cannot begin everywhere simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. He believes that planned, designed, and organized [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | change movements]] cannot succeed due to the "inertia of the existing order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:18">[01:58:18]</a>. Success depends on a "surprise factor" and a ready environment with established ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>.

In [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]], there has never been a popular uprising-led [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | revolution]] akin to the French or Russian Revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, and he sees no sign of one soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. He describes a popular [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | revolution]] leading to the collapse of a giant state as a "black swan incident," unpredictable and untheorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.

## Feminism and Gender Equality

The speaker views feminism as an "extremely harmful ideology that aims to destroy human happiness and the infrastructure of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>, gaining traction since the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>. He believes it has sabotaged the inherent relationship order between women and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, and that the current approach to "gender equality" brings only unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>. He personally believes women are superior to men in almost every field, having better minds and being more ruthless and difficult to overcome in psychological warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:12">[01:47:12]</a>. He suggests that men generally need to submit to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. He also notes that the anti-family perspective seen in the Western world, including regarding LGBT and transsexuality, appears to be reaching "a point of collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.

## External Influence on Turkish Politics

[[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey's domestic]] policy has historically been shaped by "competition between great states and the interventions of great states since the Tanzimat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. Currently, [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is described as one of the most important countries globally, navigating a dangerous environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>. As a NATO country, it has followed a path "closer to Russia than NATO" in the vital war between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:33">[01:51:33]</a>.

The speaker highlights that for decades, a significant portion of [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey's internal security and intelligence organization]] was controlled by Americans, who had agents "infiltrated every cell of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:25">[01:53:25]</a>. He notes that while the extent of Russian organization is unknown, it logically should be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. He references the KGB files revealing that influential figures in England were paid by the Soviet Union, suggesting a similar, if not larger, scale in [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>.

## The "Table of Six" and Opposition Strategy

The speaker states that the "table of six" opposition alliance was a "stillborn project" from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a>. He outlines Meral Akşener's strategic options:
*   **Short-term interest**: Joining the government, gaining spoils while the MHP is on the verge of disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>.
*   **Long-term goal**: Becoming the dominant right-wing party (BSP) by splitting and disintegrating the current BSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>. He explains that historically, only one major right-wing party dominates [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] (Democrat Party, Justice Party, ANAP, AKP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. If the AKP disintegrates after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's order, a new BSP will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>. Akşener's perspective, he infers, is to avoid being a "spare tire of the Republican People's Party" and instead become the new BSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>, which necessitates abandoning the current coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

He does not believe Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu will win the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

## HDP's Strategy

The speaker believes that the HDP allying directly with the Republican People's Party is a mistake that will weaken the HDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a>. He describes the Republican People's Party as lacking dynamism and unable to instill hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. The HDP should instead enter elections independently with a strong candidate and aim to increase its votes to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>. He suggests that if the HDP reaches the second round, and the Presidency is given to the CHP, the Prime Ministry should be given to Selahattin Demirtaş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:34">[01:43:34]</a>.

## Defining "Turk" in Turkey

The speaker addresses the question of why not all citizens of [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] are called "Turks." He states that the imposition of the term "Turk" as an element of tyranny comes from the "administrative staff of the republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. He argues that the state has "defiled the concept of Turks" by turning it into a "war slogan against its own citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

He asserts that a significant minority of the population has no reason to call themselves Turks, citing Kurds who have been Kurds for 2000 years, speak a different language, and have a different culture and social memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. He notes that in Kurdish social memory, Turks have sometimes been allies but often enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. He argues that if the Turkish state "betrays them" or tries to "humiliate them, ban their language and identity," it will face troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

He defines "Turk" as expressing a "certain segment of society" with clear boundaries defined by [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | politics]], ideology, and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. He reiterates that Kurds have been a "separate nation, a separate tribe" for hundreds of years, with different languages, social organizations, habits, traditions, and heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. He states that the only reason for them not to exist under a separate national political identity is the "narrow minded bigoted and stupid policies of those who govern the Turkish state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

He also notes that historically, non-Muslims in [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkey]] "have never considered themselves Turks," viewing it as a "great insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>. While this did not prevent coexistence, he points out that these non-Muslim elements (like Greeks) were later "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. He concludes that the state's discourse of imposing "Turkishness" is "clearly not working" and warns that failure to face this reality will lead to a "diluted fascist dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>.

## Turkish Populations East and West of Euphrates

The speaker clarifies that Anatolia is a specific region, defined as the peninsula called Asia Minor, west of the Euphrates, extending from Adana to Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. The east of the Euphrates, historically Mesopotamia or Armenia, is a different region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

Alpaslan's conquest in 1071 included Anatolia, Syria, Iraq, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. A key difference was that the east of the Euphrates had been under Muslim rule for centuries, while the west was a Christian country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>. Turkmen tribes settled in both regions equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. However, in the following centuries, Turks "melted away" in the east of the Euphrates but established "Absolute Dominance" in the west, leading to regions like Muğla, Denizli, Aydın, and Eskişehir becoming completely Turkish within 100-200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. He calls for a historian to examine why this happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

## Julian Assange and Western Collapse

The speaker describes Julian Assange's work with WikiLeaks as a "great revolution" with the potential to "collapse all the countries of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. WikiLeaks, by allowing anonymous posting of secret state information, exposed "incredible things" that should have led to the destruction of increasingly corrupt, rotten, and dictatorial Western regimes established after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>. He states that Western powers responded with "a storm of lies" and imprisoned Assange on fabricated excuses, keeping him incarcerated for 11-12 years in worse conditions than Selahattin Demirtaş or Kavala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. He concludes that they successfully "neutralized" Assange through "classic dictatorship and tyranny method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>.

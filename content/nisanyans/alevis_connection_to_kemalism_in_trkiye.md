From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Among the various social bases for the widespread influence of Kemalism in Türkiye, [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Alevis]] constitute a significant segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Historical Homeland and Migration

Historically, the homeland of [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Alevis]] has been in [[historical_context_and_origins_of_alevism_in_anatolia_and_surrounding_regions | Inner Eastern Anatolia]], particularly regions like Sivas, Malatya, and Tokat, where the [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Alevi]] population was traditionally dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

However, since the 1980s, there has been a systematic oppression of [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Alevis]], leading to their forced [[migration_and_kemalist_ideology_among_alevis | migration]] from these traditional homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Consequently, very few [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Alevis]] remain in Sivas and Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A significant portion of them have [[migration_and_kemalist_ideology_among_alevis | migrated]] to Europe, while a large number have moved to Istanbul, Ankara, and the Aegean region within Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Kemalism as a Status Symbol and Last Holdout

For [[alevism_and_its_political_stance_in_modern_turkey | Alevis]], especially in the current climate, the symbol of [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalism]] functions as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This connection stems from a desire to affirm their rightful place within the country, despite feeling ignored, disregarded, and excluded from the state and citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The adherence to [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalist]] thinking serves as their "last holdout" or "only hope of not being oppressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The perspective conveyed suggests that their stance is understandable and humane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

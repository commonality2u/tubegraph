From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Differences between genders in various fields, including arts, politics, and science, are observed and attributed to fundamental biological distinctions rather than societal factors like oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Observed Differences in Achievement
A consistent pattern suggests a notable absence of female "geniuses" across many fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Arts and Music
There is a perceived lack of prominent women in arts, visual arts, and music across various cultures and historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean and American native cultures, and Islamic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While there are some female writers, they are not numerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Politics
In politics, very few women have achieved the status of "geniuses" or highly prominent figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example, among Turks, there are very few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, with a recent example possibly being [[comparing_trump_and_erdoans_political_styles | Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Explanations for Differences

### Rejection of Societal Oppression
The idea that the lack of female prominence is due to "oppression and male domination" is dismissed as untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Biological and Psychological Factors
The primary explanation for these differences lies in the distinct biological and psychological functions of men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Structure**: Men and women have different genetic structures, leading to different biological functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Psychological Advantages/Disadvantages**: These biological differences confer varying "psychological advantages and disadvantages for women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Reproductive Role of Women**: The biological function of women is primarily centered on giving birth and ensuring the child's safety, care, and feeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is seen as a central "function in a woman's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Compensatory Drive in Men**: Men, having biological "weaknesses" or "insignificance" in the biological field, may compensate by developing "skills and ambitions" in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Animalistic Nature of Humans**: Human beings are fundamentally "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, not very different from monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The roles of males and females in mammals are "obvious and very logical" due to "biological evolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The core function of a human being is sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, and within these functions, men and women have different capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **"Decorations"**: Achievements in science, art, and politics are considered "decorations" of human existence, like a peacock's tail, that are built upon the fundamental biological roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Modern Society and Equality
In modern society, where "tactile functions have acquired such complex, unnatural qualities," discussions about "equality" and the rights of women are important and cannot be disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, the fundamental biological basis of human nature remains the underlying factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The age is characterized by "ideological lies" being more respected than objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

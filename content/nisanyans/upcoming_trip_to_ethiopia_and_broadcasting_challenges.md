The host announced that the current week will be his last broadcast from [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He is preparing for an [[ethiopia_tour_announcement | upcoming trip to Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Trip Details
The journey to [[travel_experiences_in_montenegro_and_ethiopia | Ethiopia]] is expected to last approximately three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The host will be traveling with a group of 30 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Purpose of the Journey
The trip aims to visit:
*   The tribal lands in the south of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The more famous cultural artifacts of [[cultural_and_historical_insights_into_ethiopia | Ethiopia]] in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, specifically churches from the country's old Christian past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

However, the situation in the north of [[cultural_and_historical_insights_into_ethiopia | Ethiopia]] is described as complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Potential Broadcasting Challenges
It is uncertain whether broadcasting will be possible during the three-week period in [[travel_experiences_in_montenegro_and_ethiopia | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The host is unsure about the conditions or the availability of the necessary technical infrastructure for broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Due to these potential [[challenges_in_professional_broadcasting | broadcasting challenges]], it is likely that the host will be unable to connect with listeners for about three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He stated that he would broadcast "if I have the opportunity, if I have the time, if I find the technical infrastructure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

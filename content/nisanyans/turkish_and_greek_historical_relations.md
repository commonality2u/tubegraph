The historical relationship between Turkey and Greece is complex, marked by a tradition of mutual distrust and anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

## Greece as a Former Ottoman Colony
Greece was a colony of Turkey, having been a part of the [[Historical conflicts and events in the Ottoman Empire and Greece | Ottoman Empire]] for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The struggle with the Turks holds a very important place in the Greek social mind and spirit, serving as one of the determining psychological elements of the [[Historical conflicts and events in the Ottoman Empire and Greece | Greek national spirit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## Asymmetrical Hostility
The hostility between the two nations is asymmetrical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>:
*   **From the Turkish perspective**: The Greeks, who were once ruled and exploited, are seen as just one of dozens of former subjects, holding no particular importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **From the Greek perspective**: The "Turkish issue" is a problem of existence and non-existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. It was through their struggle with the Turks that the Greeks were able to become "Greek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

This differs from the relationship between India and Pakistan, where neither was subordinate to the other in the same colonial sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

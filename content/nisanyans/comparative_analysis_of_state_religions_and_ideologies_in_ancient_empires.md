This article explores the interplay between state power and religious or ideological systems, drawing on both historical empires and contemporary geopolitical dynamics.

## The Russian Empire: Dissolution and Resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>

Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet Union, described as the Russian Empire, was liquidated almost completely peacefully, without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This event is considered unprecedented in history for a great world empire to surrender without fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

In the early 1990s, Russian society harbored a great dream of being accepted and embraced by the West, to be helped in establishing democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. They saw themselves as a natural part of European civilization, the country that produced figures like Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. However, Western countries, particularly Americans and Germans, "swooped down on Russia with an army of looters," exploiting Russia's natural resources, industrial facilities, art collections, and even its women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. This period exposed Russian society to "the ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

Towards 1998, Russian society began to resist this situation, leading to a "life-or-death struggle" against attempts to break up Russia, with Chechnya serving as a "spark point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Vladimir Putin, elected in 2002, was tasked with stabilizing the country, notably by quelling Chechen rebels, an action for which the Western world "never forgave Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

## NATO's Shifting Role and Expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>

NATO was established in 1949 to combat the Soviet Union and limit its potential hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Logically, with the establishment of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, NATO's original reason for existence disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. However, as a large bureaucratic organization, its sole purpose shifted to maintaining its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

NATO's definition of "enemy" slowly shifted, and it began to expand its area of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.
*   **German Reunification (1991):** Allowed based on an agreement with Russia, integrating East Germany into NATO member West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.
*   **First Wave of Expansion (mid-1990s):** Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary joined NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   **Second Wave of Expansion:** Three Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), which historically did not exist as independent states before 1918, were accepted into NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. These countries were seen as a "plug" against Russia's exit to the Baltic Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.
*   **Further Expansion:** Bulgaria, Romania, and parts of the former Yugoslavia were added to NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

Starting in 2008, the idea of including Ukraine in NATO gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Despite Ukrainian administration resistance, a coup in 2014 facilitated Ukraine's effective integration into NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. This led to a bloody conflict in Ukraine, characterized by the suppression of pro-Russian demands and military actions in regions like Donetsk and Lugansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.

Russia's stance since the early 2000s, especially since 2008, has been clear: Ukraine cannot and will not be included in NATO, as it is a part of Russia's historical homeland and integrated economically and culturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.

Many analysts, including George Kennan, "the theorist of the first Cold War," warned in 1997 that NATO's expansion policy towards Russia was "suicide," "madness," and would inevitably lead to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.

> "The threat of violence is as dangerous as violence. In other words, it corners a person. If you go after a person and hit him like this, seize him, and start making noise in front of his door, the gun starts to burn." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>
> "Defending oneself is often done with ugly methods." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>

The speaker asserts that the party responsible for the current war is the one that planned and willingly caused it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>.

## Germany's Geopolitical Ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a>

Post-1991, Germany engaged in significant economic expansion into Eastern Europe, financing investments and giving loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:00">[57:00:00]</a>. This process reached its limit as loans are unlikely to be repaid, necessitating further expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>. Germany had two options: either absorb Ukraine or aim for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that the current policy aims to bring down the Russian administration, hoping for a regime change that would turn Russia into an economic sphere of influence, potentially for Germany rather than America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.

Historical attempts to defeat Russia easily have consistently ended in "great disappointment," including Napoleon in 1812, the Ottoman Empire in 1877, and Hitler in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.

## State Support and the Fate of Religions

A key factor determining the success and longevity of a religion appears to be its connection to state power.

### Manichaeism: A Religion Without Sustained State Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>

Manichaeism, founded by the prophet Mani in Babylon (part of the Iranian country at the time) around the 3rd century AD, spread rapidly, reaching Central Asia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. The Uyghur Kaans and Turks collectively adopted Manichaeism as their state religion, leading to the translation of many Manichaean texts into Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. However, Manichaeism was eventually crushed, largely disappearing after the 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. The simple reason for its defeat, in the speaker's opinion, is the lack of a sustained state behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.

### Zoroastrianism: A Bureaucratic State Religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>

Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Iranian Empire before Islam, was characterized as a state and bureaucratic religion, not a popular one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>. A serious spiritual void existed within the Sassanid period (3rd to 7th centuries), which was filled by the Iranian people adopting Christianity, independent of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.

### Christianity and Islam: State-Backed Expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>

In contrast to Manichaeism, Christianity was supported by the huge Roman Empire (Byzantine State), controlling the entire Mediterranean Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>. Islam, from its inception, became a state and a giant empire, conquering parts of the Christian world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>. The existence of a "huge Byzantine State behind it" allowed Christianity to continue its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>. Similarly, when Zoroastrianism lost state security, it was quickly defeated, as was "İrem Christianity" (Christianity within the Iranian state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.

#### Sectarianism and State Influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>
Certain Christian sects, like the Nestorians, faced eradication due to not having state support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>. Differences in sect often arose from belonging to different states or empires, making a common religious infrastructure difficult to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.

## Ottoman Empire: Identity and Language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>

In the Ottoman Empire and general Islamic history, identity was primarily defined by religion and sect ("Rumness is a nation, Islam is a nation") rather than language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>. Communities speaking different languages could exist within each "nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. For example, the Karamanlides, a significant Greek population in Central Anatolia (like Niğde, Nevşehir, Ürgüp, Cappadocia, Kayseri), mostly spoke Turkish until the early 20th century, despite being Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>.

Similarly, in the 18th century, the overwhelming majority of Armenians spoke Turkish or Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. However, a "tremendous education campaign" in the 19th century encouraged Armenian children to learn and speak Armenian, leading to a resurgence of the language due to the higher quality of Armenian education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.

Language status often dictated usage: a mother tongue for home and informal settings, but a "high male language" for serious environments like politics, court, or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. This societal pressure could lead to language shifts over generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

## Modern Bureaucratic Dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>

The speaker argues that Western countries, even more than places like Russia, are subject to an "extremely organized and extremely captive" bureaucratic dictatorship that pervades every area of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. People's daily lives are spent complying with "meaningless and purposeless rules of a package of bureaucratic cuts," with a high probability of punishment for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>. This system, previously called "democracy," is described as a "show" where political leaders merely "pretend to govern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. Bureaucracies globally are growing stronger, increasingly suffocating societies and narrowing the scope for political competition and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>.

## Critiques of Social Sciences

Modern social sciences, particularly as developed in the 20th century, especially after 1945, have attempted to adopt a mathematical image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. This approach was influenced by the historical success of mathematics in fields like astronomy, physics, and chemistry, which dealt with the movements of "dead objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. Scientists like Galileo used mathematical foundations to challenge institutional authorities and establish a new scientific methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

However, applying this mathematical model to living beings, and especially to humans, leads to its "total bankruptcy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. Human behavior and the concept of free will cannot be fully explained or reduced to algorithms through mathematical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>. While mathematical habits can offer additional perspectives and statistical data can be useful for falsifying hypotheses, they cannot fully explain social phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

A significant portion of what is taught as social sciences in universities—including sociology, economics, and anthropology—is perceived as an exercise in political and social propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. This propaganda aims to justify the superiority of one group over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. Political science teaching, in particular, is considered a propaganda study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. It often *a priori* accepts Western European and American political systems as good, then attempts to establish teaching methods to emulate them, often using excessive numbers and equations to appear authoritative without necessarily conveying understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

Regarding economics specifically, it is stated that "Economics and finance are two separate issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.

## Challenges in Educational Systems

The speaker identifies the secondary education institutions—middle school and high school (ages 12 to university)—as having gone bankrupt globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. This critique applies to Turkey, Greece, and Western countries like England, France, America, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.

Key issues include:
*   **Outdated Curriculum** The curriculum is outdated, with much of what is learned having no equivalent or practical application in real life, leading to it being quickly forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **Fostering Laziness** The system can accustom young children to laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Lack of Alternatives** A child completing high school by age 18 often has no option but to go to university, as there are no viable paths to achieve anything in real life otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Drug Epidemic** A terrifying drug epidemic in schools is observed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.

The speaker contemplates a radical solution: dissolving the middle school and high school systems and closing the Ministry of National Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.

## Broader Societal and Historical Transformations

The discussion also touches upon [[historical_and_modern_societal_transformations | broader historical and modern societal transformations]] affecting education and other fields.

There has been a catastrophic decrease in the quality of education in Europe over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a> (correction: this timestamp is for Greek resistance, finding the actual timestamp for education quality decline). The actual timestamp for the decline in the quality of education in Europe is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. The speaker says: "The quality of education extremely decreased As a result of the catastrophic decrease in the last 20 years, there has been a great decrease in the quality and quality of the administrative staff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

This decline has led to a significant decrease in the quality of administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, exemplified by figures like Ursula Von Der Leyen in positions of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

In the context of the Ottoman Empire, the lack of qualified urban planners in Turkey in the 1920s led to inviting German architects, partly due to the decimation of non-Muslim professionals (who constituted 90% of those trained in European universities) and Germany's economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. This highlights how historical events can impact a nation's professional and educational capacity.

The discussion implies that [[modern_academic_issues_and_education_critique | modern academic issues and education critique]] are part of larger [[societal_changes_and_historical_perspectives | societal changes and historical perspectives]], where established systems, like the parliamentary institution of the 19th century, are now obsolete and no longer function effectively worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. Similarly, traditional ideas of freedom of the press and media are seen as meaningless in the age of the internet, which requires new forms of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>.

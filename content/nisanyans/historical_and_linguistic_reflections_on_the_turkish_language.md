## Debunking Baseless Linguistic Theories

The discussion touched upon a question regarding the similarity between Basque and Armenian words, where a friend noted 20-30-40 words with great similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. It is easy to find lists on this topic by searching "Armine" on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. However, such claims are largely dismissed by those familiar with linguistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

The Basque language, spoken in northern Spain and France on the Atlantic coast, is considered strange as it has no known relation to any other European language identified to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Scholars have pondered this for 500 years, attempting to find similarities and explanations, often falling into despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

It is possible to create common word lists between almost every language on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, with theories linking Basque to Sumerian, Turkish, Georgian, Armenian, Siberian, and Etruscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. However, most collected examples in these lists are wrong, distorted, misread, or based on printing errors or incorrect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Occasionally, one or two words might be genuinely similar by chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. An experienced linguist can quickly identify the weaknesses in such lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. For instance, if two words are said to be the same, their meanings might shout at each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>, or a common name for a newly discovered object would be impossible at the time of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Furthermore, some words might have passed through intermediate languages, such as Spanish words passing through Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. The theory about a relationship between "pearls" (likely referring to a specific linguistic theory) proposed in the 1890s was also concluded to be untrue after research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. To this day, no convincing genetic connection has been determined between Basque and any other language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

Similar to the belief in jinns, attempts to prove ethnic ties between Sumerian and [[linguistics_and_etymology_of_turkish | Turkish]] based on linguistic similarities are seen as driven by a strong desire to believe rather than empirical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

## The Historical Evolution of Turkish

The historical development of the Turkish language is considered a highly interesting and valuable subject that should not be left to "Turkish fanatics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. The speaker had personal intentions and notes from prison to write a book on this topic, with a skeleton of the work already formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

### Turkish as an Imperial Language
The speaker challenges the modern narrative that Turkish was merely a tribal or clan language, as portrayed by Turkish governing cadres since the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Instead, Turkish has been an imperial language throughout its [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_of_turkish_language | history]] for approximately 1300 years, similar to Latin, Greek, Arabic, and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. It was a language of administration for many peoples whose mother tongue was not Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

The speaker highlights that more than half of the people who knew and spoke Turkish used it as a second language, not as a primary one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Turkish was shaped in a crucible, emerging as a common language for [[influence_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Armenians]], Arabs, Kurds, Iranians, and Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. This perspective contributes significantly to the [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | cultural formation of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Impact of Other Languages on Turkish Vocabulary
The article mentions the [[impact_of_french_and_other_languages_on_turkish_vocabulary | impact of French and other languages on Turkish vocabulary]], albeit briefly in the context of the word "Tehcir".

## The Word "Tehcir"
The word "Tehcir" (Deportation) was discussed, noting a specific event on May 7, 1923, where 20-odd Circassian villages in the Marmara Region were exiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. This was due to their perceived opposition to the Kemal regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. In the 1940s, some were allowed to return to their villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

The term "Tehcir" itself is a made-up word, marginal in old Arabic and Ottoman dictionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Its original meaning was "to set off early in the morning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. Its use in the sense of deportation emerged exactly in 1915, appearing in official ministry correspondence as a typical Neo-Ottoman bureaucratic usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. It was used to avoid saying "exile" (Nefy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

After the overthrow of the Obedience and Progress regime and the lifting of press censorship in November 1918, "Tehcir" suddenly became part of the press language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. This shift is seen as an act of hypocrisy, as the widespread massacres were known but could not be spoken about openly for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. "Tehcir" became a technical, polite word used to cover up a crime too heavy for the conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire and other ancient states frequently resorted to "exile" (Nefy) as a method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>.

## Revival of Languages
The question of whether a dead language can be revived was addressed. Hebrew is presented as a successful example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. It was dead for centuries, known only by scholars from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. Through a systematic campaign, a new Hebrew was created and revived as the common language of Jews who gathered in Palestine at the beginning of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. After two generations, the nation in Israel speaks this language fluently, with beautiful literature and films produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

Another example is the Welsh language, spoken in the Wales region of England, which was largely dead but revived with state policy starting in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. The principle is simple: if a language is taught in primary school, children will learn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>.

In contrast, Ireland's attempt to revive the Irish language after gaining independence in 1920 was largely unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. Despite being made the official language, 99% of Irish people still speak English, and parliamentary debates are held in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.

The global community is currently witnessing a severe humanitarian crisis in the Middle East, particularly concerning the events in Palestine and Gaza, which are described as a "terrible massacre" and "genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This has ignited widespread anger and condemnation worldwide.

## The Israel-Palestine Conflict

### Current Situation in Gaza
Gaza is characterized as a "very crowded, very densely populated concentration camp" where over 2 million people live under heavy pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Residents are severely restricted, unable to move more than 100-200 meters from the sea, living cut off from the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The State of Israel is reportedly bombing this area mercilessly, including institutions like schools and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The explicit purpose of these actions is believed to be to force people to "give up and flee to Egypt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Simultaneously, an "ethnic cleansing movement" is expected to be launched in the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This constitutes the "most terrible humanitarian disaster of recent years, of recent decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Global Reaction and Predicted Outcomes
The events have aroused fierce and overwhelming anger and hatred worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. It is doubted that Israel, as a small country, can cope with this level of global sentiment in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Bloody events are unfolding, and equally bloody retaliatory incidents are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Historical Context of Oppression
The oppression in Palestine is not limited to recent bombings; it has been ongoing since 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. A large population has had their lands forcibly confiscated and been expelled from their homes, condemned to life in "concentration camp refugee camp[s]" under miserable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This includes daily humiliations, bans, and deprivation of basic human and citizen rights, which are described as being worse than Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The occupation of land is presented as a main issue, with parallels drawn to historical colonialism and conquests seen in Turkey, America, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. While historical oppressions are acknowledged as crimes, they do not excuse today's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

### Evolution of Views on Israel
Previously, there was sympathy for Israel, particularly in its early years (first two generations), when it was seen as establishing a "valuable country, civilized" and a "source of honor for humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. However, for the last 20 years, especially since Netanyahu and his associates came to power, Israel is seen as having taken a different path, becoming "the prisoner of a culture full of incredible hatred" and one that "sees oppression as its right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The question is raised as to how long a country can exist "only through continuous and endless oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

### Islamist Elements in the Palestinian Cause
While acknowledging that the Palestinian cause is exploited by Islamist groups (like Hamas, which has governed Gaza for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>), and that there is anti-Semitism in some pro-Palestine perspectives, it is stressed that the cause is "not only their cause" but "the cause of all humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. It is argued that Israeli society, despite its modern appearance, can be as bigoted as the Islamist groups, being "drunk with oppression" and having "lost its moral anchor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

The idea that the land must be Arab Muslim Palestinian with specific cultural practices (beards, chador, call to prayer) is deemed "very, very unfortunate" and "a great insult to the entire society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Future of Israel
It is thought that Israel will not be able to overcome the current crisis in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

## Regional Actors

### Arab States and Iran
Initially, [[Role of Western and Arab states in geopolitical conflicts | Arab states and Iran]] responded to the crisis with an "extremely sloppy attitude," essentially following America's orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. However, this situation is predicted to change due to "mass pressure, public pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
Iran is expected to enter the war, possibly after Gaza is "leveled," as global public pressure and hatred towards Israel reach an "unbearable point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

### Combating Islamist Fanaticism
Beyond Israel, other states are presented as successful in combating Islamist fanaticism. Russia (with its Chinese Muslim, Tatar, Dagestan, and Chechen populations) and China (with the Uyghur terrorism movement) are cited for their success through "education, through economic development, flexibility and understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Less robust examples include Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman (noted as very successful), Kuwait, and Bahrain, where Islamic fanaticism is less apparent despite preserving Islamic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## International Involvement

### Western Support and Public Opinion
Western countries are currently supporting and encouraging Israel "by 10000%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. However, there are doubts about how long this determination can be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Public opinion in Western countries has taken an "unprecedented" stance against their own states' pro-Israel policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Pro-Palestine demonstrations have been banned in England, France, and Germany, with threats of arrest, punishment, and deportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Despite this, hundreds of thousands are challenging the state and police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Social media, particularly TikTok, shows overwhelmingly pro-Palestinian sentiment (15 times more than pro-Israeli messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Questions are raised about whether Western states are genuinely incompetent or acting under "some obligations" regarding their "determined and uncompromising" support for Israel since 1917 or 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### NATO's Role
The [[the_current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_the_us_europe_and_russia | NATO alliance]]'s ability to continue after the Ukraine fiasco is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Notably, NATO has been silent on the latest [[Current geopolitical conflicts including the Ukraine and Gaza | Israel-Palestine incident]] beyond initial statements, with military preparations being made by individual nations like America and England rather than NATO as an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. This could be due to Turkey's NATO membership and its differing stance, potentially allowing Turkey to veto NATO decisions on the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Context
The "real War" is not the Israel-Palestine War or the [[IsraelIran tensions and global geopolitics | Iran-America War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. It is a "global hegemony war" waged by America and its allies against a worldwide hegemony led by [[American and Chinese Geopolitical Tensions | Russia and China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

### Ukraine War
The Ukraine War is quietly approaching its end, with the Western alliance beginning to give ultimatums to Ukraine, indicating the war is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Ukraine is expected to accept territorial losses, and Russia is unlikely to accept ceasefire or peace offers at this stage, as the Ukrainian army has disintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. The probable outcome is the elimination of the Ukrainian state, with a demand for the demilitarization of the Baltic Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

### Western Civilization's Decline
The centralization of states and the control exerted by military and intelligence institutions, particularly those of the United States, have collapsed Western civilization and culture since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. There is no longer room for freedom or autonomy in countries that act as "colonies of America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Examples include the Julian Assange case and the elimination of national banking systems' autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

### Future Revolution
A revolution is not a dream, but it must be global, not country-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. American hegemony and any potential replacement global hegemony must be broken, if necessary, "through war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. This "great revolution" has started in Ukraine and may continue in Palestine, Iran, and similar places, aiming to break the central control mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

### US Involvement in Conflicts
The US is accused of orchestrating events to justify wars, citing the Pearl Harbor attack and the Gulf of Tonkin incident as examples where the American administration knew about or even ordered attacks to manipulate public opinion into supporting war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. Similar doubts are expressed about the 9/11 attacks and the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This is presented as a "standard procedure for states" to create an excuse for war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

The family's experience during the [[personal_experiences_of_deportation_and_its_impact | Deportation period]] was largely unspoken, with subjects like the [[personal_experiences_of_deportation_and_its_impact | Deportation]] never discussed directly within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both sides of the family originated from Istanbul, having been residents for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Deportation in Istanbul

The [[personal_experiences_of_deportation_and_its_impact | Deportation]] was not generally implemented in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, a significant incident occurred on April 24, 1915, considered the first move of [[personal_experiences_of_deportation_and_its_impact | Deportation]] in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. During this event, between 150 to 200 people were arrested and sent to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The vast majority, almost all except three or five individuals, were never heard from again, having been killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The paternal grandfather, a writer and publishing house owner, was among those arrested on April 24, 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He was held for a while before being released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Additionally, at one point, an exiled individual hid in the grandfather's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Despite these challenges, the family managed to continue their existence in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Migration to France (1922)

In 1922, following the fall of Izmir, panic spread in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This period marked the first time France allowed the [[migration_to_france_during_the_1922_period | mass migration]] of Armenians from Istanbul to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, a situation distinct from 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

> [!INFO] Family's Escape
> In September 1922, the family, including the paternal grandparents and their siblings, packed into ships and left Istanbul in great panic, migrating to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Return to Istanbul and Business Revival

After approximately two to three years in Paris, the paternal grandfather decided to return to Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His motivation was to revive the family's old publishing house, which specialized in publishing Turkish translations of famous modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He opened bookstores and second-hand bookshops in Beyazıt Square, near the current university's Faculty of Letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These shops became among the most well-known and beloved in Istanbul, remaining so until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Educational Impact

The maternal grandmother's education was significantly affected by the events of 1915. All Armenian schools in Istanbul were closed that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. As a result, the grandmother, who was around fifteen years old and in middle school at the time, had to attend a school opened by French Jews for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This experience led to her proficiency in French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Armenian schools eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, but by then, the grandmother had been married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

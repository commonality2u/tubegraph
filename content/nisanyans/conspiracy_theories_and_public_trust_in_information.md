The role of [[conspiracy_theories_and_authority | conspiracy theories]] and their prevalence is closely linked to public trust in information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

## Erosion of Trust in Official Information

A significant factor contributing to the rise of conspiracy theories is the societal loss of trust in information sources and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

> [!info] Causes for Loss of Trust
> *   Political leaders, especially in the Western world, are perceived as consistently lying or engaging in deceit that makes society look foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
> *   Information presented as "truth" is seen as largely biased propaganda, often influenced by financial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.
> *   Trust in experts, state administrators, news sources, and the media has been deeply shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>. There are "extremely obvious reasons" for this erosion of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

When people reach a dead end in interpreting events, particularly positive ones, they begin to produce alternative hypotheses, questioning if there is a hidden agenda behind official narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that official statements from those in authority are lies, and the actual truth is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. This environment leads to a proliferation of ideas and hypotheses from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

## Evaluating Theories and Hypotheses

To assess the accuracy or inaccuracy of theories put forward, two primary criteria should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>:

1.  **Understanding of Authority and Institutions**
    *   Do the proponents of these theories have a realistic understanding of how relevant authorities and institutions operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>? This includes knowledge about the thought processes of foreign policy, bureaucracy, security agencies, political decision-makers, hospitals, and public health managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. It's important to consider if they have researched the subject or understand the theoretical infrastructure of executive staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.

2.  **Distinguishing Truth from Hypothesis**
    *   Do those proposing theories present them as absolute truths or as hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>? A crucial question is whether these individuals possess the intelligence to understand this fundamental difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.

> [!tip] Respecting Hypotheses
> Theories presented as logical hypotheses, based on a chain of reasoning, should be respected, especially when official theses lack a basis due to perceived deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. It's essential to ascertain if those seeking explanations understand the distinction between absolute truth/belief and a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

It is suggested that the majority of individuals who attempt to win an argument by simply dismissing an idea as a "[[conspiracy_theories_and_authority | Conspiracy Theory]]" are either immoral or uninformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>.

## The True Function of Science

Contrary to common belief, science's primary function is not to seek the truth about the universe [00:06:36]. If truth is found, it is considered an additional benefit [00:06:40]. The fundamental role of science is to identify and overthrow the mistakes of other registered scientific professionals, essentially to prove them wrong [00:07:05]. The underlying motivation for all scientific work is a struggle for [[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | power]] and the readjustment of power balances within academic institutions and disciplines [00:08:00].

## Methods of Advancement in Science

There are several ways to gain influence in the field of science:
*   **Silencing:** Shouting down or silencing the opposition [00:09:05].
*   **Authority:** Relying on higher authority, such as rectors, deans, or the majority, to crush dissenting views [00:09:14].
*   **Reasoning and Evidence:** Presenting more accurate reasoning, new facts, and evidence within a framework of accepted principles to overcome rivals through debate [00:09:34]. This third method is considered the most noble, correct, and beneficial to humanity [00:10:02].

For this third method to be effective, there must be a common acceptance of basic scientific actions and a consensus on methods of reasoning and presenting evidence within the academic and cultural world [00:10:12]. This implies the existence of a rational authority or arbitration institution [00:11:24]. However, since the 1970s, particularly in [[power_dynamics_and_elite_control_in_western_societies | Western academic life]], this consensus has been systematically dismantled [00:11:52]. As a result, the ability to expand scientific horizons through new data and reasoning on a common knowledge base has disappeared [00:12:41]. Only the first two methods—silencing and appealing to authority—remain, a situation deemed "pathetic" and leading to "big disasters" [00:13:27]. This authority can be the university administration, the state, public opinion, or a [[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | dictatorial institution]] [00:13:07].

## The Evolving Role of Universities

Today, the function of universities and institutes is primarily to train personnel for state and private institutions, bureaucracies, large organizations, and research bodies [00:14:10]. This often means training individuals who are "dysfunctional" and do not produce anything of real-world value, but rather fill cadre needs [00:15:06]. University education teaches bureaucratic working methods, such as paper writing, Excel usage, and techniques for presenting ideas within a bureaucratic framework [00:15:20]. These functions are largely unnecessary in the broader context [00:16:15].

The modern university system produces a significant portion of graduates who become "waste" – unemployable and unable to make positive contributions outside of bureaucratic roles [00:16:56]. Graduates often lack practical skills for everyday life [00:17:47], being trained only in disciplines focused on bureaucratic paper transfer [01:18:20]. This situation is described as a "very tragic thing" [01:18:34], leading to young people being educated into their late twenties or early thirties without any practical profession [01:18:44].

## Freedom of Thought in Decline

[[Philosophical exploration of political power and freedom | Freedom of thought]] requires accepted "referees" or main concepts [00:23:44]. In the absence of this foundational consensus, freedom of thought loses its functional meaning and devolves into chaos, as the rules for one idea to prevail over another become unclear [00:22:05]. This leads to individuals forming closed "bubbles" where they only interact with and mutually confirm the ideas of those who agree with them [00:22:43].

The speaker predicts that perspectives advocating [[Philosophical exploration of political power and freedom | freedom of thought]] will rapidly disappear [01:24:06], with an increasing global trend towards attitudes that dismiss it [01:24:26]. This trend became particularly evident during the Covid period and the Ukrainian war [01:23:15]. A growing majority, especially among young people, appears to prefer censorship over [[Philosophical exploration of political power and freedom | freedom of thought]] [01:23:45]. Historically, [[Philosophical exploration of political power and freedom | freedom of thought]] was an "elite concept" [01:25:33], not a democratic process, requiring a select minority to arbitrate ideas and define common consensus [01:24:33].

## Political Power and the Production of Science and Art

The production of science and art is a result of [[historical_and_political_transformation_in_global_power_dynamics | political power]] [00:25:19]. When a society, civilization, or country becomes stronger and more prosperous through rapid development, enrichment, and strengthened social dynamics that allow it to dominate other societies, scientific and artistic production enters a "bright period" [00:25:32].

Science and art cannot exist without wealth and [[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | power]]—be it political, military, or economic [00:26:20]. Powerful societies historically achieve this by:
1.  **Patronage:** Wealthy, powerful, intelligent, talented, and creative individuals are patronized and supported [00:26:59]. They possess the self-confidence to accept new, unheard ideas [00:27:37].
2.  **Attraction of Talent:** Such societies act as magnets, attracting talented and qualified people from other societies [00:27:49]. For instance, after 1945, the United States used its economic and military power to attract qualified personnel and artists from Europe and Asia [00:28:04]. Similarly, the ancient Roman Republic attracted ambitious individuals from across Italy and the Mediterranean world [00:29:03].

This process relies on the accumulation of surplus value through taxes, tribute, and plunder, which creates public wealth to fund arts and sciences [01:10:44]. The speaker cites the Timurid renaissance in Central Asia as an example of this phenomenon, where a brilliant civilization and literature emerged from economic accumulation [01:10:07].

## The Demise of Painting in the 20th Century

The decline of painting in the 20th century is attributed to the "great spiritual chaos period" following World War I [01:28:56]. Respected segments of society suffered a severe loss of position and were rejected [01:29:14]. This led to a questioning and rejection of traditional values across the Western world and beyond [01:29:53]. While this initial reaction was healthy, as it broke "dead branches" and aimed to "open a blocked channel" in a stuck civilization [01:30:10], it did not lead to a new synthesis [01:31:30].

Instead, the modern art movement was "usurped" by wealthy art collectors, primarily Americans, exemplified by figures like Peggy Guggenheim [01:31:48]. Art was transformed into an investment tool and a means of social prestige [01:33:14]. This shift led to an understanding where the more shocking, absurd, or destructive a piece was, the more beautiful, expensive, and valuable it became [01:32:06]. The speaker believes Western art never recovered from this, considering most post-1945 art to be "complete garbage" [01:33:33].

## Challenges and Criticisms of Modern Systems

### Modern Academia
The speaker is pessimistic about the future of modern academia, believing it has completed its function as an institution and cannot be fixed in its current form [01:13:42]. While higher education institutions will always exist, the current structure is unlikely to evolve positively [01:14:09].

### Individual Armament
The idea of individual armament is deemed unwise [01:44:21]. It is considered foolish to believe one can resist the organized [[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | power]] of a state or an army with a personal weapon [01:44:45]. Furthermore, there is a high probability that an individual given a weapon will use it for "bad purposes" or in a way they will regret [01:44:13]. The speaker shares a personal experience of disposing of a gun after realizing they could not trust themselves to not use it in moments of conflict [01:43:29].

### Global Political Events
The possibility of seizing Russia's reserves and assets abroad is described as an "unprecedented disgrace" with "terrible consequences" [01:35:59]. It is seen as a threat unlikely to be executed due to its implications for the dollar-based world economy [01:36:35]. The recent actions of the US regarding an international navy to counter Yemen are criticized for their "lame and incompetent" execution, with key allies refusing to join [01:37:16]. Israel's attack on Gaza is viewed as an unsustainable move that could lead to Israel's transformation or elimination, questioning why the US would support such an "absurdity" [01:37:45].

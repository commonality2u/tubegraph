Holding meetings on the topic of [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion|reason and religion]] often elicits strong, negative reactions from two diametrically opposed directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One perspective questions the connection between [[faith_and_rationality|reason]] and language, while the other asks if [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion|reason and religion]] are inherently opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This latter view, rooted in Enlightenment philosophy, suggests that claiming [[faith_and_rationality|reason]] is independent of religion ultimately turns [[faith_and_rationality|reason]] into another subject of [[debate_on_faith_and_knowledge|faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Persistence of Religious Belief

Despite advances in science, the number of religious people globally is not decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Empirically, people continue to believe in religion even when non-belief is a real social option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, eighty years of compulsory anti-religious propaganda in Soviet schools led many to conclude that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

An anecdote illustrates this point: an intelligent Polish filmmaker remained a devout Catholic who fulfilled Catholicism's requirements to the smallest detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. His reason was that in a country like Poland, amidst meaninglessness, oppressiveness, and lies in public life, Catholicism offered a necessary anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. While the speaker personally considers this a "wrong way," he acknowledges that for some, it is a path to which they are carried away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

This persistence of religion as a widespread and permanent phenomenon indicates it responds to a real human need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## Defining Rational Thought and Its Engagement with Religion

Rational thought is defined as a specific way of facing the truth, coping with data bombardment, and trying to make sense of incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. It involves putting forward assumptions or hypotheses and testing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. When confronted with contrary results, one ideally revises the theory or seeks a new, more correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This approach, where hypotheses are falsifiable, is the "way of learning" and the "way of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Intelligent people must confront and seriously explain the phenomenon of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Those who represent rational thought do not have the luxury of ignoring or belittling religion; they must understand, embrace, and confront it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Three methods for engaging with religious hypotheses are suggested:
1.  Accepting the hypotheses as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
2.  Taking them seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
3.  Falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
The latter two are considered more enjoyable and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### The Challenge of Communication

A key question is how to communicate irreligiosity to religious people without causing offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The speaker suggests learning from institutions like the Jesuits, known for their success in conveying religion to young people indirectly, often through moral or psychological issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

The primary purpose of such discussions is not to destroy a believer's religiosity, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Instead, it is more valuable to reinforce non-religious people or those undecided, as they lack a strong, informed discourse on religion in societies like Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Historically, non-religious individuals in Turkey have defaulted to either dismissing religious people as not worth talking about, or advocating for their suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This has left religion to the monopoly of religious people, preventing rational counter-arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Evolution of Religion and the Disconnect with Reason

Initially, religion may have functioned as an early form of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain unknown phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. For example, attributing forest disappearances to Jinn or victory in battle to divine intervention were early "scientific hypotheses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Scientific hypotheses do not have to be true, only falsifiable and able to explain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The early narratives of creation, such as those in the Torah, also contain significant scientific effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

However, a critical turning point occurred when religious concepts became increasingly abstract and resistant to falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. For example, a God (like in the Quran or Bible) is defined in a way that any challenge or question has an existing, unfalsifiable answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

### Faith vs. Scientific Fact

The distinction between [[debate_on_faith_and_knowledge|faith]] and scientific fact is highlighted by the story of Thomas in the Bible, who demands to touch Jesus' wounds to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Jesus implies that believing *after* seeing or touching has no value; true [[debate_on_faith_and_knowledge|belief]] is prior to empirical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Tertullian, a 3rd-century Christian thinker, famously stated, "I believe because it is absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This suggests that [[debate_on_faith_and_knowledge|faith]], by definition, relies on illogical or unfalsifiable propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

In contemporary debates, like discussing the prohibition of pork in Islam, even when presented with logical arguments about its economic or biological benefits, the final answer from a believer is often, "Because I believe this; I am not obliged to question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. This indicates that [[faith_and_rationality|faith]] and [[faith_and_rationality|reason]] cannot meet on common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## The Role of Tradition and Positivism

Religious systems often rely on [[role_of_tradition_in_religious_beliefs|tradition]] or claims of ancestral wisdom for their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. However, as knowledge evolves, even this traditional authority can become insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. This often leads to a reliance on "inhuman" or divine revelation that bridges the gap between human understanding and ultimate truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

A critique of positivism suggests that it makes a logical and terminological error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Positivism, often associated with Enlightenment, assumes that as knowledge increases, ignorance decreases, leading to an eventual complete understanding of all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. However, the speaker argues that the more one learns, the more one realizes the vastness of their ignorance, akin to realizing the sea's immensity the further one sails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

The true characteristic of science is not that it is "true," but that it is a method where all propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. If a theory explains phenomena and no strong counter-arguments are found, it is accepted until a better one emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. In contrast, those who claim ultimate, unfalsifiable knowledge (like in dialectical materialism) can resemble religious adherents in their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. Rational thought, however, thrives on open discussion and the demand for proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

## The Quran and Historical Interpretation

When discussing the Quran, a [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion|rational approach]] involves considering its origins and historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. For instance, the Quran mentions Mary (mother of Jesus) as the daughter of Imran and sister of Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Objectively, this suggests the Quran's writer may have conflated Mary, mother of Jesus, with Mary, sister of Moses (whose brother was Aaron and father was Amram, a Hebrew equivalent of Imran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

While a believer might propose alternative hypotheses (e.g., another Imran, another Aaron), the most natural conclusion for a rational person is a confusion of historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This is further supported by the historical presence of Jews and Christians in the Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad's time, suggesting access to biblical narratives even if Muhammad himself was illiterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. The wording of "book" in the Quran even implies someone unfamiliar with physical books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

This kind of [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion|historical and philological discussion]] is necessary to understand the origins of holy books and how they are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Goal of Rational Engagement

The goal is to intelligently "wage war" against the irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This means seeking to "surround religion with [[faith_and_rationality|reason]]" or "enclose it in a cocoon of [[faith_and_rationality|reason]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. In this analogy, [[faith_and_rationality|reason]] must be the referee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This process involves trying to explain religious data in a more rational, common-sense manner through [[faith_and_rationality|rational thought]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

This approach is crucial for Turkey, especially considering the current [[role_of_religion_in_society|religious position]] and its political and cultural consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The aim is to discuss [[role_of_religion_in_society|religion]] on a [[faith_and_rationality|rational basis]], determine its boundaries, and understand its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This includes concrete discussions on the [[role_of_religion_in_society|position of religion]] within Human Rights Law and the limits of freedom of expression in religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. The speaker envisions establishing a permanent institution, perhaps even a Faculty of Theology, that approaches religion rationally, rather than as a vocational high school for propagandists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

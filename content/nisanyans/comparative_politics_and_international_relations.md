## The Armenian Genocide and Turkish Denial Policy

April 24 is commemorated as the Armenian genocide commemoration day, especially in Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that while his general attitude towards national feelings and expressions changes, this human event inevitably affects a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the country, 235-250 prominent Armenian intellectuals, writers, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, and clergymen were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They were collected from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A few days later, they were sent to Ayaş and Çankırı in Anatolia, and most were never heard from again, presumed killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This operation is described as a political collapse operation, similar to events seen in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman period, where the state profiles, collects information, and suddenly rounds up individuals, guilty or innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Among those gathered were individuals strongly against extremist nationalist Armenian movements, and others not involved in any organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Similar round-ups of leading figures occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The speaker recounts a story from Sivas where leading figures were called to the governor's office, killed, and thrown into a cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The purpose was to eliminate those who could make a sound, paving the way for the deportation of civilians, children, and others starting in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This gradually escalated into mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The speaker states that denying the genocide is either complete ignorance or immorality, often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. He asserts that the Turkish State, from 1895 onwards, slowly designed a genocide project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. From 1913, it systematically prepared the infrastructure, and in 1915, it put this plan into practice with a conscious approach not expected from the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

### Evolution of Turkey's Denial Policy
Until 1975, Turkey pursued a policy of silence regarding the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. Until 1965, the Republic of Turkey and its spokespeople knew about the genocide but chose not to speak on the issue, believing it was best not to express an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. During this era, Turkey had a high reputation in the Western world, and there was a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.

The issue was first brought back to the world's agenda in 1965 by the Soviet Union, specifically Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. However, Turkey still maintained its silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. In 1975, following Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974, the issue suddenly erupted in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>. An organization called ASALA emerged, attacking Turkish institutions and embassies, which was followed by the Western press suddenly recalling the Armenian Genocide as one of the 20th century's biggest crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

At this time, Turkey adopted a "stupid" denial policy, believing it could ride out the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This policy, architected by figures like Cem Coşkun Kırca and Foreign Ministry officials, involved a systematic and forceful denial that "such a thing did not happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. The speaker argues this was clearly a policy destined for fiasco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. After 1974, Turkey's standing in the international arena plummeted, and relations with the West fractured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>. Turkey's denial was seen as shamelessness and rudeness by the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>.

From 2005 to 2011-2012, a "window of hope" opened for Turkey to abandon its denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. For the first time, the genocide was openly discussed in Turkey, with some politicians and sane individuals admitting that it was a terrible event that destroyed millions of Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. However, this courage did not translate to the official level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. The speaker believes that confronting the issue would have relieved Turkey of a heavy burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. The Armenian society has carried a heavy burden for 107 years as an "obsession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

The speaker asserts that the Armenian Genocide is the most important social and political event of the century-long period from Abdulhamid's era to the Union and Progress regime and the Republican period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>. It fundamentally changed Turkey's society, composition, and political transformation, with its psychological and economic basis rooted in the genocide and the cleansing of the Greek and Assyrian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>. This cleansing project, thought of since the 1890s during Abdulhamid's time, was systematically implemented by the Union and Progress Party, especially after 1913, following the Balkan War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:15">[02:31:15]</a>.

The speaker notes that cleansing Greeks was "relatively easier" due to mutual population exchanges, unlike Armenians who had nowhere to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Deporting Armenians to Russia or Armenia during World War I would have meant giving material to the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:05">[02:51:05]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, facing likely defeat and loss of eastern provinces, decided there was "no other solution other than cleansing, other than massacre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:29">[02:55:29]</a>. Hundreds of thousands were killed to prevent demands for compensation, land, and assets after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:29">[02:55:29]</a>.

## German Politics and International Relations

Cem Özdemir, a leader of the German Green Party, is quoted as saying that Russia's war against Ukraine is aimed at the international community, making it vital for the West, including Germany, to support Ukraine with more weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:41">[04:46:41]</a>. The speaker expresses shame and amazement at this stance from someone once considered leftist and humanist, viewing it as a "mental illness" trying to "burn the world" and a sign of "American servitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:03">[04:47:03]</a>.

In contrast, the Social Democratic Party's prime minister, Olaf Scholz, is seen as trying to pursue a more cautious and difficult policy, balancing and moderating without losing footing, and protecting Germany's, Europe's, and humanity's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:46">[04:47:46]</a>. The Christian Democratic Party also prioritizes Germany's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:32">[04:48:32]</a>. The speaker predicts a government change in Germany, favoring a Social Democrat-Christian Democrat coalition, and wishes for the "purging" of the Green Party, whose "Atlanticist NATOist" approach is seen as a "Trojan horse" in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:46">[04:48:46]</a>.

## Interference in International Affairs

The speaker discusses whether a country should interfere in another's internal affairs, specifically regarding America's involvement in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. He argues that it cannot be categorically stated as right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. If neighbors are to live together, they must interfere if one disturbs the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. States must calculate the long-term results of their decisions, and if a neighboring country's foreign or domestic policy might cause trouble, intervention becomes a duty to one's own people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>. There is a limit to this decency, though, not to "poke around" in a neighbor's bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

### US Foreign Policy in Pakistan
America's foreign policy is described as "falling apart" and having lost credibility due to "panic behavior intertwined with boundless arrogance and boundless ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. The overthrow of Imran Khan in Pakistan is considered a mistake the United States will regret for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Pakistan is in revolt to an unprecedented extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. Imran Khan openly challenged America regarding the Ukraine-Russia war, stating he was "fed up" with their concepts and would continue commercial and economic relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

Most significantly, for the first time since 1947, Pakistan and India are aligned on an important foreign policy issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. This is a "bicycle the West cannot handle" regionally, as US policy in South Asia is built on India and Pakistan being in constant conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. If they act together, "America will be finished in the Asian continent," which is why Khan was overthrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. The speaker suggests that the few members of parliament needed to overthrow Khan could have been swayed by "five million each" from America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

## The Concept of Empire and Modern US Global Influence

The speaker discusses the concept of "empire" in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>. Since the 19th century, the nation-state is described as an "artificial and imaginary structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>. Historically, great states like the Roman, British, Russian, and Soviet Empires were not based on national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.

America, especially after 1945, developed a new model of sovereignty within its borders, becoming a "one-cent state" that does not allow another nation to live there except "Americanness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>. However, it effectively governs many countries without direct administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:24">[01:26:24]</a>. It decides how much tribute to receive, not through taxes, but by funneling money, provides military decisions, and determines foreign policies of these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>. Its staff are placed at key internal points, and many heads of state are reduced to "provincial governors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. In this sense, the US has established a "rough global empire" and a legal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.

This new model offers an advantage because, unlike old empires (Roman, British, Tsarist), which had obligations to their citizens (e.g., providing rights, hospitals, schools), the US system governs Western Europe, Mexico, and Turkey, but has "nothing in return" for its sovereignty and "no obligation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. It is "honey cream" – rights without responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>.

## Historical Shifts in Power and Culture

### Byzantine Empire's Center of Gravity
The speaker discusses the center of gravity of the Byzantine Empire. Its borders changed significantly over time, and during long periods, the Balkan Peninsula fell out of its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. In the 8th and 9th centuries, Byzantium's center of gravity was Anatolia, pressured from both sides by Arabs and Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. The Byzantine culture spread between the Euphrates and the Danube, with the strait and Istanbul falling in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

### Ottoman Empire's Balance
The speaker is unsure if the Ottoman Empire's center of gravity was Rumelia. Rumelia was a more fertile agricultural land and contributed a more significant part of the state's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. However, the military, another important leg of the state, came from Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>. The Ottoman Empire always maintained a balance between these two regions and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

Fatih Sultan Mehmet, according to the speaker, grew up in a cosmopolitan environment of the Second Murat Period, which saw a great cultural fusion in the Mediterranean region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>. This was a world where Greeks read Plato, and Italians, architects, and artists were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. Fatih's father, Murad II, was part of an era where "animality and respect for the East" had not been lost in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. Fatih, like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, is seen as a product of the Ottoman Empire's cosmopolitan culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>. However, the Ottoman Empire later culturally "closed down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>.

## Christian Influence in Africa

The speaker addresses the question of why Christianity did not concentrate Western culture in Africa despite its early arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. The root of this question is a fundamental mistake: assuming "Christianity equals the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. Non-European Christianity, such as Eastern and African Christianity, is distinct from European Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

Eastern Christians, under pressure from Islam, sometimes sought refuge with Western states throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. However, this does not imply great love between them, as many Christian traditions have nothing to do with Western Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

An example is Ethiopia in the 16th century, which, facing a Muslim threat supported by the Ottomans, called for help from the Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. The Portuguese came to stop the Ottoman advance but then tried to convert the Ethiopians to Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. After some success, the Ethiopians overthrew and executed the Europeans, leading to a long "dark period" where they closed themselves off from both Muslims and Europeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

In the 19th century, Ethiopia faced the same dilemma as the Ottomans: how to modernize and Westernize without abandoning their religion and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. This "dead end" was experienced by many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. However, today, the West is no longer an attractive model, having become a "hated, mad, senile nuisance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. The world has entered an era of "directionality" with new models like Russia, India, and regional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## Turkish-Greek Relations and Eastern Mediterranean Geopolitics

The speaker notes that the Greek military and armed forces expect a serious war with Turkey in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:29">[01:44:29]</a>. While the speaker questions the sanity of this, he acknowledges that the disease of nationalism may have "deafened their brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.

Regarding the "blue homeland" defense, the speaker notes that gas was discovered in the Eastern Mediterranean, with plans to send it to Europe via Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>. However, Israel, Egypt, and Greece formed a triple alliance, trying to exclude Turkey, which the speaker calls an "unwise and wrong policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. In response, Turkey adopted a "control stance," claiming the areas and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. However, in the last month or two, this issue has become intertwined with the Ukraine war, causing alliances to change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:22">[01:46:22]</a>.

## The Izmir Fire and its Aftermath

The speaker dismisses the idea that silence around the Izmir fire was due to bankrupt insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. He states that the Western public opinion was shaken by the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>. However, coming after World War I, where millions died and cities were destroyed, people were accustomed to destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>.

Secondly, there was a widespread understanding that nation-states were being redesigned in Eastern Europe, involving ethnic cleansing and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>. It was clear that Turkey would leave, Greeks would go to Greece, and Turks in Greece would come to Turkey, with a "waterproof wall" between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>. There was no one in the Western world defending Izmir staying with the Greeks; it was clear it would be given to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>. The argument for giving Izmir to the Greeks was that it would be a shelter for Greeks expelled from the Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>. The speaker argues that the Aegean Region is nothing without the port of Izmir, which is essential for its produce to reach world markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>.

The British approach was not to give Izmir to Turks but to use it as leverage to force a positive agreement in terms of the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. This is likened to today's resource policy using Ukraine to remove Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>. The Greeks were used to force the Turks into an agreement acceptable to the West after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:45">[01:39:45]</a>.

## The Rise of New Oligarchy and Political Shifts

The speaker discusses the voting patterns in Hungary, noting that Viktor Orbán won elections with significant majorities, including around 90% of votes in the lowest-income electoral districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. This is attributed to Orbán raising their standard of living and becoming a spokesperson for the people, rather than the urban European "pseudo-segregations" they hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

The term "leftist" is deemed absurd, with "new oligarchy" being a more accurate term for the wealthy and powerful class in Western countries who have lost touch with left and democratic values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This class, largely university graduates, feels strong due to institutional backing and has learned to obey modern urban institutional norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. They believe their prejudices are the truth because they are ignorant of other viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

These American "liberals" or "surrender fashion and moral trends defenders" are those who hold power and wealth in society and will fight to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>. The speaker questions why they are still called "left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

## Other Political and Historical Commentary

The speaker mentions that in Türkiye, the wind changed in 2013, and the balance of power shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. This led him to speak out against a "rabid version of Islam," resulting in his imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. He disputes that the average legal order in Western countries is better than Turkey, citing ignorance, prejudice, indifference, bribery, and corruption in all countries, including America, Greece, France, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. While Türkiye's high-level political structure has diverged from the West in recent years, daily legal disputes are "more or less all the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

The speaker notes that the Soviet Union's role in bringing the Armenian Genocide back to the agenda in 1965 was distinct from America's later policy of using the issue as a "stick to beat Türkiye" after 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. He attributes this to Turkey's "Cyprus crimes" which violated basic principles of international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This led to demonstrations and attacks on Turkish institutions globally, an unprecedented event for a NATO member country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. This situation created a context where a "skeleton from Türkiye's past" was brought out, and Turkey "foolishly" fell into the trap of denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>.

The speaker discusses the "left opening" of the Republican People's Party (CHP) in Turkey in 1964-1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. He questions if such a step, in the coldest days of the Cold War, was possible without America's permission and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. İnönü's personality was a factor, but the party was divided despite him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. The emergence of the Turkish Workers' Party in 1965, which gained significant parliamentary success, caused panic in the Turkish political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. The CHP needed a leftist opening to survive against this threat and against the large right-wing bloc, ensuring its role as a "founding element of its order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. İnönü, with his strong candidate Bülent Ecevit, orchestrated this to prevent the party from veering too far left towards a coalition with the Labor Party or the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

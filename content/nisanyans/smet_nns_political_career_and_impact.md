This article focuses on İsmet İnönü's [[politics_in_the_country | political career]] and its impact, drawing from a selection of articles written by the presenter, notably one from 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Personal and Political Characteristics
İsmet İnönü is described as a manager without a grand vision or a penchant for discussing it, and not a megalomaniac with ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He was at a low level according to the standards of his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Unlike [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], his interest in Western culture and law was sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He acquired his love of classical music in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. He was known for being cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> and astute in political strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. He was also known to ignore questions he didn't want to answer, sometimes using his hearing aid as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Relationship with Atatürk and Rise to Power
İnönü and [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Atatürk]] were close allies for 17 of Atatürk's 19 years in power, co-managing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. However, their relationship was complex.
After 1930, İnönü maintained a distance from Turkism movements, which were prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. An old enmity existed between İnönü and figures associated with the Turkish Hearths school, such as Reşit Galip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This enmity intensified into a "blood feud" for Turkists after İnönü broke the pro-Nazi structure in Turkey with arrests in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Turkism, having distanced itself from the Progress Party tradition, became a major cleavage line in Turkish [[politics_in_the_country | politics]] after 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

While İnönü shared the values of the revolutionary regime, as Prime Minister under Atatürk, he remained publicly silent on reform projects that diverged from a rational line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He prioritized stability above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. He played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, he adopted a more moderate stance during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His opposition to Atatürk's policies regarding Dersim led to his dismissal from office and "political death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Atatürk was deeply angered by İnönü's parliamentary speech on Dersim, which contradicted Atatürk's preferred approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This led to İnönü's dismissal and replacement by Celal Bayar as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

During Atatürk's final year, İnönü was effectively erased from public life, his name becoming dangerous to mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. Despite this, after Atatürk's death, İnönü was unanimously elected president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. This swift, unanimous decision among powerful and ambitious figures remains an unexplained and enigmatic aspect of Turkish Republican history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

## Policies and Impact during Presidency (1938-1950)

### Post-Atatürk Era
Upon becoming president, İnönü initiated significant changes. The picture of [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Atatürk]] was removed from money and other public places in 1938, seen as a first step towards "erasing the traces of a 15-year period of power intoxication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This also involved removing Atatürk's image and dedications from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Atatürk's body was kept in the basement of the Ethnography Museum for 12 years, showing an attempt to distance from the Soviet-style cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

However, the "cult of the founder God" was revived after 1950 and intensified after 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The Democrat Party, upon coming to power in 1950, made [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Atatürk]]'s cult "the only unquestionable truth of the country" through an agreement with the Republican People's Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This involved reviving the [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Atatürk]] culture, enacting a protection law, reviving the Anıtkabir project, and placing Atatürk busts in public offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

### Economic and Agricultural Policies
İnönü's economic policies were cautious, even described as "arrested," due to his understanding of the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This conservatism, accused of being strict or cowardly, was prevalent in the 1930s and 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. After 1946, when the United States opened credit lines, he approved rapid economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

He did not prioritize flashy, symbolic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Instead, he was involved in significant "real revolutions" like planting tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur, as well as the eradication of malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Land reform projects in Urfa and Aegean also came to the agenda during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### World War II Neutrality and Challenges
A key achievement of İnönü's [[smet nns Influence on Turkish Cultural and Educational Reforms | political career]] was keeping Turkey out of the World Wars, preventing the country from being drawn into disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He pursued a "two-faced policy" to manage relations with both the Allies and Germany during WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The Allies sought to prevent Turkey from selling chromium, a crucial resource for German steel production, to Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Despite avoiding war, the war years were difficult for the Turkish people, marked by ration cards for bread, forced labor, and military pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. However, this suffering was minor compared to countries like Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The perceived hatred towards İnönü for these hardships, in contrast to the positive memory of WWI (which involved massive suffering but also wealth transfer from plunder), is a point of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

During the war, policies like the 1942 Wealth Tax and conscription laws were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The Wealth Tax particularly affected non-Muslims, who were also subjected to forced labor camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Cadre and Village Institutes
İnönü aimed to replace older, nationalist "Kuvayi nationalist" cadres with young, educated professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He supported figures like Hasan Ali Yücel and İsmail Tonguç, who were instrumental in establishing the Village Institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. These institutes were significant, but İnönü's inability to fully support them led to their closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Later Political Career and Legacy (Post-1950)

### Transition to Multi-Party System
İnönü's career after 1950 is noted for his role as the first and possibly only National Chief to leave power after an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. In 1950, Turkey was undergoing a risky transition from a single-party regime to a democratic election period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

### Role in Coups and Later Conflicts
In the 1960s, İnönü played a crucial role in reining in the radical, Nasserist-leaning elements within the military after the 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. He supported a softer, "half-baked" transition program towards democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. He clearly sided against the radical revolutionary faction within the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

However, his later career included criticized actions such as [[Political strategies and leadership criticism | political struggles]] with Demirel, supporting the 1971 military memorandum, and clinging to office against the younger Ecevit when he was 87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. These actions damaged his reputation and contributed to the "fossilization" and deadlock of major [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | political positions]] in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Controversies and Historical Context

### Fatih Events (1934) and Jewish Population
In 1934, during what are known as the Fatih events, the Turkish state decided to expel the Jewish population living outside Istanbul in the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. This policy, which was part of a broader strategy to concentrate non-Muslim populations in Istanbul and purify Armenian communities in Anatolia, led to attacks, property confiscation, and an attitude of hostility from authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. The motivation behind this, whether racism or perceived state survival, remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

### Greek Community Exiles (1955, 1963)
The 1955 Greek pogrom (September 6-7) in Istanbul was triggered by demonstrations related to Cyprus's potential unification with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>. In 1963, following conflicts in Cyprus that exposed the failure of its two-community structure, around 50,000 Greek passport holders living in Istanbul were expelled within a week, losing their belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. This incident was a "retaliation" for events in Cyprus, though it targeted a population protected by the Treaty of Lausanne, which allowed Greeks in Istanbul and Turks in Western Thrace to remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:45">[02:00:45]</a>. This action undermined a mutual balance established to protect minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>.

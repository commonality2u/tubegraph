Morocco was described as a magnificent and beautiful country after a three-week trip that involved exploring both its southern and northern parts, including Marrakech and Tangier, extending towards the Strait of Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The country is characterized as docile, humane, and civilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Modernity vs. Tradition

A significant aspect of [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Morocco's social landscape]] is the blend of modernity and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Modern parts of cities, particularly Rabat, are clean, orderly, and contemporary, offering all the conveniences and commercial services of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Morocco is observed to be cleaner than Turkey, Egypt, and Iran, suggesting a well-functioning municipal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

In contrast, the old cities, such as the Medina in Marrakech and the Fez Bazaar, are vast and have been preserved in their original detail, with no modern structures intruding on their historical character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Rural areas in the south continue lifestyles from centuries ago, indicating a broad social spectrum within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It is suggested that Morocco has entered the 21st century to a lesser extent than Turkey, and in some ways, is "a few steps ahead" if concepts of 'backward' and 'forward' apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Colonial Influence

The 40-50 years of French rule have had a considerable effect, with French being widely spoken and official signs predominantly in French, sometimes even without Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This colonial legacy has left a "European polish" on the society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Despite this, many dimensions of the traditional social order have been preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Cultural and Political Identity

Moroccan identity is strongly linked to its monarchy, with the slogan "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (God, Homeland, King) seen on various branches and expressed by the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Love for the King (Muhammad VI) is widely observed, with his photographs displayed in businesses, government offices, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Older and conservative individuals do not express negative opinions about the King, while a more modern, secular middle class demonstrates fanatic loyalty to the King, drawing a parallel to fanatical Kemalists in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. An "astonishing social equivalence" was observed between radical Muhammad VIism and radical Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Highlights of [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Travel Experiences]]

Several places stood out during the trip, showcasing Morocco's unique blend of nature, vibrant urban life, and historical depth:

*   **Sahara Desert:** Staying in a camp in the sand desert near the Mauritania border was described as an unforgettable and special experience, providing goosebumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Djemaa el-Fna Square, Marrakech:** This square is considered one of the most unique places in the world, active 24 hours a day with storytellers, snake charmers, fortune tellers, and musicians during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. In the evening, food stalls transform the space into a bustling hub of diverse and delicious food, accompanied by the distinct sounds of [[berber_identity_and_arabization | Berber]] musicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Fez Bazaar:** Described as unparalleled globally, it is larger than the Marrakech Bazaar and has retained its historical character without becoming overly touristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The architecture, including doors, inner courtyards, palaces, and madrasahs, is incredibly beautiful, reflecting a highly civilized past that was on par with 15th or 16th century Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
    *   **Active Crafts:** A significant aspect of the Fez Bazaar is the active presence of manufacturing tradesmen, operating as if in the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Unlike Turkey, where crafts are largely gone, Fez boasts vibrant sections like the Carpenter, Tile Makers, Lamp Makers, and Leather workers bazaars, producing high-quality handicraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. However, concern was raised that the average age of these craftsmen is over 50, implying the tradition might fade within 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Claudio Bravo's Palace (Taroudant):** This palace, built by Chilean artist Claudio Bravo, exemplifies a rare combination of immense wealth and refined artistic taste in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Bravo, known for his classical painting style akin to Velasquez and his acquaintance with both Western and [[cultural_and_architectural_influences_in_marrakech | Moroccan/Eastern/Islamic arts]], created a palace of considerable beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. The palace's future, after Bravo's death, is uncertain due to a lack of equipped heirs, raising questions about the long-term preservation of such grand endeavors without consistent agricultural income or a large family to maintain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This highlights the challenges of [[importance_of_historical_and_cultural_monuments | preserving monuments]] in the modern age.

## Challenges and Incidents

During the [[travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_europe | travel experiences]], a significant challenge arose in Spain where the travelers were robbed, losing passports, a driver's license, cash, and reading glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. This incident necessitated a complex return journey involving travel papers that limited movement to Greece and Armenia, where new passports would be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. The prevalence of tourists in Morocco was also noted as a negative aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

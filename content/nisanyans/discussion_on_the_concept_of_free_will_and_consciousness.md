From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of free will is often misunderstood, with a common misconception being that it refers to the ability to direct one's life or manage actions based on principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. However, free will, as understood in a [[philosophical discussion on morality | philosophical sense]], is synonymous with the freedom of will itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. It is the subjective feeling that one can choose to act, not act, or choose a different action in any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. This feeling is universally experienced by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

## Free Will and Consciousness
The speaker posits that free will and consciousness are synonymous concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. Consciousness is defined as the feeling of being a subject who decides their own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Denying free will is, therefore, equivalent to denying consciousness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. Human consciousness is the fundamental concept underlying human experience and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

### Challenges to Free Will
There are two main perspectives that argue against free will:
*   **Scientific Determinism**: Many in "so-called scientific circles" assert that human actions are determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. They believe that through fields like psychology, [[artificial intelligence | Artificial Intelligence]], and Big Data, human behavior can be predicted and algorithmically described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This view suggests that everything in the universe is determined, like billiard balls moving by hitting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Religious Determinism**: Similarly, those who believe that God directs all actions and that human beings have no control over their fate also deny free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

Both these deterministic viewpoints converge on the idea that humans lack free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. However, the speaker disagrees with both, arguing that both perspectives are incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

### The Paradox of Consciousness
Despite the deterministic views from science and religion, humans subjectively experience an "infinite area of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. This creates a paradox: while historical, sociological, and psychological sciences seek objective laws and cause-and-effect relationships to explain human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>, every individual actor experiences a choice in their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. This suggests that these disciplines, along with religious doctrines, are "incapable of explaining the basic psychological reality of the creature called human, the phenomenon of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

If all actions were purely determined by objective forces, there would be no fundamental difference between a living being and an inanimate object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. The human mind appears unable to fully grasp the phenomenon of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. The concepts of self, consciousness, and free will are interconnected and fundamentally beyond human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

## Free Will in Living Beings
Free will is not exclusive to humans; it is a common feature of all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. The feeling of self and subjective agency extends to all animals, not just humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. A fundamental, innate distinction in human consciousness (factory settings) divides the world into living and inanimate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. This distinction is known by human babies from around one month of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

*   An inanimate object, like a ball, possesses no free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   A living creature, like a kitten, does possess free will, perceiving the world with consciousness and being able to choose various actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

The scope of freedom, or the range of possible actions available to a creature with will, varies by species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. It is very limited for a jellyfish, wider for a kitten, and much wider for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. However, it is the same fundamental concept of free will that applies across these living beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. The key distinction lies between living beings (with free will) and artificial intelligence (lacking free will) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. There is a difference of degree in consciousness between humans, kittens, donkeys, and grasshoppers, but a difference of kind between living beings and [[artificial_intelligence | Artificial Intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

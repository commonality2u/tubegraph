From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker frequently finds themselves at the center of controversies, experiencing what they describe as "lynching campaigns" on a national scale in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. They jest that this frequency must place them in an "ambitious position in the world leagues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, attributing this "privilege" to being "born in the wrong country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Recurring Themes of Backlash

The speaker outlines a history of public controversies, emphasizing a pattern of misunderstanding and overreaction from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Key Incidents:

*   **2000 - Black Sea Travel Guide:** The speaker first experienced widespread public outrage in 2000 due to comments in a Black Sea travel guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   **Bayburt Comment:** The guide described Bayburt as a "terribly unique place" where women and girls would "run away as if possessed by a demon" when foreigners entered back streets, comparing it to "a place like Afghanistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The speaker defended this as a "correct simile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, noting their own travel dreams include Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> and positive feelings about Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    *   **Topal Osman Comparison:** A comment about the Topal Osman Monument in Giresun city park, referencing Abdullah Çatlı, caused outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The speaker stated they shared a prison sentence with Çatlı's friends and knew the "love and admiration" they held for him, while personally disliking his ideology and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   **"Natashas" in Trabzon/Rize:** The guide mentioned the prevalence of "Natashas" (sex workers from former Soviet republics) in the Trabzon and Rize region, stating that "the main sector of the region had become the work sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The speaker noted that "Natashas filling the lobby were completely harmless," and it was a "likeable hotel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   **Defense:** The speaker argues there was "nothing negative" in these statements, using irony and a "distant view" to tickle subjects others take "very seriously," which "drives people crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   **Şirince Constructions:** The speaker faced "several waves" of hate campaigns due to constructions made in Şirince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **Freedom of Speech on Allah and Prophet (2009, 2012):** In 2009, the speaker was criticized for questioning the "limits of freedom of speech... regarding Allah and the prophet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In 2012, they were "lynched" for statements about the "historical personality of the Prophet Muhammad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The speaker insists they have "never insulted Allah or the prophet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, viewing these backlashes as attempts to "restrict freedom of expression, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

*   **Psychologist-Client Intimacy:** The speaker was subjected to a "wild lynching campaign" for questioning the moral defensibility of a public backlash against a psychologist involved in a sexual intimacy scandal with a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The speaker noted their lack of moral judgment on the issue itself, but questioned the "consequences of the lynching created on a personal level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

*   [[Political and social reactions to natural disasters | Elazığ Earthquake]] **(20xx):** The speaker was "lynched" for asking a question regarding the [[Political and social reactions to natural disasters | Elazığ earthquake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They questioned why people would pray for a city's population to die, but then feel bad when they actually died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The speaker clarified that their concern was for the "innocent" children, not the "fascist and bigoted" men of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, deeming this the "morally correct approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

*   [[Controversial historical and religious figures | Atatürk]] **and his Adopted Daughters:** The speaker's recent controversy stemmed from a question about [[Controversial historical and religious figures | Atatürk]]'s relationship with his adopted daughters, particularly the "gossip" of a mistress relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The speaker stated that this gossip is "known by everyone" and mentioned in foreign memoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The speaker's core question was whether it is "right for an adolescent to adopt a girl and keep them in his private apartment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, arguing that "the event itself is wrong" even without physical contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. This discussion also brought up the taboo subject of Abdurrahim, [[Controversial historical and religious figures | Atatürk]]'s adopted son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. The speaker criticizes "[[Political strategies and leadership criticism | Atatürk]]'s disciples" for using his icon to justify "all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. They identify this as a "pathology specific to Türkiye," a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

*   [[Controversial political events in the US and Europe | Hrant Dink Murder]] **and Samast's Release:** The speaker commented on the release of the murderer of Hrant Dink, Samast, disagreeing with the sentiment that "murderers walk among us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. The speaker emphasized that Samast served 17 years in prison, half his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. They view modern prisons as "the cruelest torture institution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. The speaker contends that the true instigators of the murder are known, but people have been "incapable of saying its name" for 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. The speaker interprets the focus on Samast's release as a deliberate attempt to "divert the target" and avoid identifying the "will of this murder" that "did not belong to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

## Response to Backlash

The speaker describes the process of "lynching campaigns" as routine and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. They note that threats are often from "keyboard warriors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a> and openly provided their address on [[Social media and political controversies in Trkiye | social media]] to challenge those making threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Other Topics and Opinions

The speaker also touches upon various other topics:

*   **German Geopolitics:** They discuss Germany's foreign policy, particularly its perceived submission to the United States regarding the Ukraine War and the Gaza War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. The speaker suggests Germany is making "licking the appropriate places of the United States a national sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>, and criticizes German leaders like Scholz and Baerbock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. They argue that the unification of Germany in 1990 changed the world balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a> and that Germany's future depends on a "close alliance and friendship relationship with Russia" due to Russia's natural resources and market, and Germany's industrial and labor capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. The Nord Stream pipeline, a project championed by Merkel, was seen as a way to create mutual dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>, but the U.S. "had no intention of allowing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. The speaker also mentioned the Navalny poisoning as an operation to disrupt Germany-Russia relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

*   **Ottoman Perception of the West:** During the Tanzimat Period, educated Ottoman classes "unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This was based on observations like Westerners taking fewer bribes, respecting women, having clean cities, and being advanced in science and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. [[Social and political issues in England | Women's rights]] were a significant aspect of this, with Ottoman intellectuals advocating for women's education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>, leading to the establishment of girls' schools and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. The concept of class, however, was weak in Ottoman culture until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

*   **Power and Human Psychology:** The speaker asserts that the desire for social power and sexual power are often linked in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. When a man gains "unlimited power," they tend to "push the limits," leading to a "dream of a harem" and a desire for sexual relations with many individuals, regardless of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. The speaker notes that [[Political strategies and leadership criticism | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] is a "counter-evidence" to this, having been at the top of power for 21 years without such reported mischief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

*   **Religion without God:** The speaker discusses the long-standing question of whether religion can exist without a god, and if threats from invisible beings are necessary for people to follow rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. They believe religion is a "very serious social need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>, but the traditional idea of an omnipotent God "has ceased to be a defensible idea" for "the wise part of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

*   **Kurdish Issue:** The speaker engaged in a discussion about [[Social and political comments on historical and modern issues | Turkish racism]] and the Kurdish issue. They assert that the Turkish project to assimilate Kurds "has failed" and is a "terrible defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. This became evident when Kurds started attending university in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. The speaker believes the "victory of the Kurdish side" will involve integrating into the system and taking it over from the inside, leading to a new balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>.

This article explores the historical and contemporary migration and settlement patterns in Eastern Anatolia, drawing insights from a book published in 2006 titled "Turkey east of Ankara" in Turkish, and "A trip for Eastern Turkey is rejected" in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. The book is bilingual, though the Turkish and English versions are described as "two different books with two different approaches" due to addressing different groups of people with varying prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. The author conducted extensive research over six years, traveling frequently to all districts and villages in the region, including Ardahan, Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and northern Van, and speaking with various community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:03">[02:41:03]</a>.

## Historical Ethnic and Cultural Structure
Information regarding the [[historical_ethnic_structure_of_eastern_anatolia | ethnic structure]] and [[cultural and linguistic history of Anatolia | cultural structure]] of Eastern Anatolia in the past was gathered during these travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">[02:09:03]</a>.

### Ottoman Era Urban Centers
Before the early 20th century, major cities like Van and Diyarbakır were primarily populated by Turkish-speaking inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Van**: In the 1910s, there was "no trace of Kurds" in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. By the early 20th century, about half of Van's population was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:01">[05:25:01]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır**: In the city center, Turkish language was spoken, and major families were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">[03:36:06]</a>.
*   **Mardin**: While the ruling class in Mardin was Christian, the language of the city was Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:03">[05:49:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:07">[05:57:07]</a>. Ruling families considered themselves Turks, but almost all Turkish families in Mardin had Armenian ancestry, indicating significant intermingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:03">[06:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:01">[06:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### The Ottoman Ruling Class and Turkification
The Ottoman ruling class across the empire, including Eastern Anatolia, was cosmopolitan and of diverse origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:06">[04:30:06]</a>. Individuals migrating to cities, regardless of their original background (e.g., [[albanian_migration_and_influence_in_trkiye | Albanian]], Georgian, Circassian, Dagestani), would often become part of the state mechanism, adopt Turkish, and integrate into Turkish society, being recognized as Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This contributed to the cities having a predominantly Turkish-speaking elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Role of Non-Muslims
Non-Muslims, particularly Armenians and Assyrians, undertook almost all urban services in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Their presence provided a "somewhat cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## Republican Period and Demographic Shifts
The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had an "unexpected result for the Turks," making cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin "uninhabitable" as essential services and professions (dentists, tailors, insurance companies) disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### Urban Decay and Elite Migration
During the early Republic period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities dwindled as they sent their children to study in Ankara and Istanbul, who then chose not to return to their hometowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Consequently, until the 1960s, these cities "gradually collapsed and decayed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Kurdishization and Resettlement
A significant shift occurred in the 1960s with a massive migration from villages to cities, driven by economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. As a result, the cities in the region gradually became more Turkified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. However, this process eventually led to the "complete Kurdishization" of the region, which is cited as the "greatest success of the Republican regime" in Eastern Türkiye over the past century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

*   **Mardin**: In the 1970s and 1980s, Mardin city center had "no trace of Kurds," with the rural areas being Kurdish and the city center speaking Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
    *   The city of Kızıltepe, 20 kilometers from Mardin, grew significantly and became a larger settlement than Mardin because the "pressure of the Turks to migrate to the city was prevented in Mardin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Kızıltepe is described as a "Kurdish city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
    *   Today, Kurds constitute the numerical majority in Mardin city center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır**: Currently, Diyarbakır is almost entirely Kurdish, estimated at 80 to 90 percent, if not 100 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Van**: Kurds are by far the majority in Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

## Contemporary Realities and Challenges
While Kurds were historically numerous in the region, they were confined to rural areas in terms of "social power and opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Today, they are "almost homogeneous in their own country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This demographic shift has created social demands that are deemed "impossible to prevent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

<div class="callout">
    **Conclusion on Kurdish Language**: In a region with nearly 20 million people, where Kurdish is spoken by the overwhelming majority with pride, it is impossible to hide or suppress the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. It is an "indisputable fact" that everyone living or wishing to live in the region, including Turks, must learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Delaying this recognition will lead to greater trouble and an "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
</div>

The region now hosts a homogeneous Kurdish population of 20 million, with 87 to 90 percent dominance in their own area, possessing their own language and "organic intellectuals" who seek to express national ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. Ignoring these realities, such as limiting them to a "home element," is not feasible in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

<div class="callout">
    **Geopolitical Implications**: International dynamics and the significant military power disparity make the establishment of an independent Kurdish state difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. The US, a vital ally, would not seek to disintegrate Turkey nor allow for the creation of Kurdistan at Turkey's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. However, powers that would benefit from Turkey losing control in the region, particularly the part closer to Russia, include Russia, Syria, and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

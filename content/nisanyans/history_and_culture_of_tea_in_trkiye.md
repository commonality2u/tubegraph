Tea's absolute dominance among beverages in [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] and its pervasive culture began primarily during the Republican period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Early Introduction and Influences
Tea first entered [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] and the [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Ottoman]] world during the Tulip Era in the 1700s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Ottoman]] tea vision, traditions, and customs were significantly shaped by two main cultural influences: Iran (or the Persian land) and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **Russian Influence:** The use of the samovar was learned from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Large, brass, Russian-made samovars were common in the houses of the well-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. It's noted that "domestic samovars are useless" and Europeans generally do not use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Iranian Tea Quality:** In the past, the best tea used to come from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Emergence of Tea Production in Türkiye
Until the end of the 19th century, there was no tea production in [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although there is a vague recollection of tea production possibly starting during the reign of Abdulhamid, with planting in Georgia or across the border in [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], specific details are not recalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The systematic and conscious campaign for tea cultivation began in the Republican period, likely in the 1930s or 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Rize's Role:** Tea was planted in the province of [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Rize]], and a Tea Institute was established there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **State Policy:** The state gifted or allocated tea saplings to anyone who wanted them, initiating systematic tea production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This policy was prioritized by state decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Pioneer of the Project:** The first manager and pioneer of this project is a "valuable person" who has a bust or similar recognition at the Tea Institute in [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Rize]], yet their name is regrettably not widely known despite their influential role in [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | Türkiye]]'s destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Shift from Coffee to Tea
Historically, from the 16th century to the early 20th century, Turks were known for drinking coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Europeans learned about coffee from [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] and the [[historical_perspectives_and_cultural_heritage_of_turkey | Ottomans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Tea, which arrived in the 18th century, was considered an imported luxury consumer good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The Republican period government made a strategic decision to promote tea over coffee due to economic considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>:
*   **Coffee Import Dependency:** Coffee is a tropical plant impossible to grow in [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], requiring imports from distant regions like Arabia, Yemen, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Weak Foreign Trade:** During the first decade of the Republic and the inter-war period, [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s foreign trade volume was weak and constricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Local Production Potential:** Observing Georgia's successful tea cultivation in the [[cultural_and_ethnic_history_in_turkey_and_the_surrounding_regions | Eastern Mediterranean climate]], it was decided that [[historical_narratives_and_geographical_significance_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] could also grow tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

This shift from coffee to tea was a deliberate state policy aimed at achieving self-sufficiency and reducing import dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

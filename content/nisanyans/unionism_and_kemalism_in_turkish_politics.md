A discussion highlighted a common perspective that [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] and Unionism are opposing political traditions [00:02:53]. This view often identifies [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] with the Republican People's Party line [00:02:56]. However, a counter-argument suggests that there is no significant difference between the two [00:03:08]. While they represent different eras (1900s vs. 1920s) with varying emphases and nuances, they are fundamentally the same political movement and ideological tendency [00:03:20]. More accurately, they can be described as a 20th-century version of Turkish Muslim national identity and traditional worldview [00:04:04].

## Understanding Unionism

Unionism originated as the Young Turkish ideology [00:04:10]. By the early 19th century, the Muslim ruling classes of the Ottoman State faced the existential threat of collapse and annihilation [00:04:15]. A psychology of defeat enveloped society during the reigns of Abdulaziz and Abdulhamid [00:05:09]. The overthrow of Abdulhamid created a significant generation gap, as his oppressive regime had prevented the renewal of cadres [00:05:30]. By 1908-1914, an old, conservative establishment dominated [00:05:53].

Young, educated cadres, who had been excluded from power, suddenly rose in 1908 with a forceful declaration that the country was collapsing and must be saved [00:06:05]. The Unionist regime emerged as a "cry for liberation" [00:06:35]. By 1913-1914, nearly all educated Muslim cadres in Türkiye united around this political movement, leading to its unanimous ascent to power [00:06:42].

### Core Principles of Unionism

The fundamental principles of Unionism were twofold:
1.  **Muslim Identity and Modernization** [00:07:11]:
    *   The belief that society and the ruling class existed *because* they were Muslim [00:07:14].
    *   Acknowledging the need to govern a society with a significant non-Muslim population (which was very large in 1910) [00:07:20].
    *   Recognizing that they had fallen behind Europe and needed to adopt the "secrets of this new civilization" [00:07:43].
    *   Their national identity was indisputably Islam [00:07:57]. The aim was to cleanse this national identity of "reactionary, outdated, lethargic" elements to enable the Muslim society to stand strong again [00:08:15]. This meant they could adopt anything from Europe—technology, culture, art, military—as long as it served to maintain their existence as a Muslim ruling class [00:08:25].
2.  **Elimination of Non-Muslims** [00:08:46]: The presence of non-Muslims was seen as an obstacle to this project, leading to the conclusion that they "must destroy them" [00:08:53].

Unionism saw Islam as its core identity, but believed it needed reform to prevent disintegration [00:09:08].

## Unionism's Evolution into Kemalism

The cadres who came to power in 1919 were the same people and organization as the Unionists [00:09:16]. The financial, monetary, and organizational foundations of the national struggle were established by Unionists [00:09:22]. However, this period faced new realities:
*   A large portion of the empire had been lost [00:09:39].
*   Virtually no non-Muslim population remained in the remaining territories [00:09:47], removing the "cleaning the non-Muslims" agenda item [00:09:52].
*   The post-World War I global order was dominated by Western powers (England, France, the United States) [00:10:06], necessitating good relations with them [00:10:22].
*   There was a need to make peace and join international bodies like the League of Nations [00:10:31].
*   To make the "greatest crimes against humanity in modern history" (referring to the Armenian Genocide) forgotten or forgiven, good relations with Western states were crucial [00:10:42].

This new atmosphere meant continuing the same Unionist project in a different world [00:10:59].

## The Dual Nature of Kemalism

There is a common misunderstanding that identifies [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalist ideology]] solely with Westernization and secularism [00:11:21]. However, [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] has a dual foundation, acting as a "forked-tongued" movement [00:11:31]:
*   **Towards the Masses**: For the majority Turkish population, the essence of [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] was focused on defeating the seven powers, protecting the homeland and the nation [00:11:47]. It was a Muslim movement based on Muslim [[influence_of_nationalism_in_turkish_politics | nationalism]] [00:12:16].
*   **Towards Western Elites**: To gain favor from Western states and the elites of Istanbul and Izmir, an image and discourse of Westernization were presented [00:12:30]. A secularism project was introduced to silence conservative voices within the country [00:12:50].

This dual approach meant [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] operated on "two legs" or "two rails" in the 1920s and 1930s: homeland/nation/Sakarya on one side, and modernity/secularism/Westernism on the other [00:13:06]. In the education system, the focus on homeland and nation was predominant [00:13:27].

In essence, [[critiques_of_kemalism_and_its_modern_interpretations | Kemalism]] is not truly separate from Unionism; its superficial dimensions should not mislead [00:13:41]. It is fundamentally the continuation of the Ottoman imperial ideology, adapted to the new dangers, risks, and opportunities of the age [00:14:04]. There has been no real rupture between the traditional Islamic understanding and this adapted version [00:14:24].

## Contemporary Political Landscape

The current [[contemporary_turkish_politics_and_islamic_influence_in_state_ideology | Turkish political landscape]] is sometimes viewed as a choice between "Islamist authoritarianism" (associated with the AKP and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) and "ethnic nationalist totalitarianism" (a [[mustafa_kemals_political_strategies_and_legacy | Kemalist]]-Unionist alliance, or "nationalist Fascism") [00:15:02]. However, this dualistic view is dismissed as too immersed in daily polemics [00:15:41].

It is argued that the era of democracy in Türkiye has ended and will not return soon [00:16:07]. State institutions, particularly security institutions, have become extraordinarily powerful, capable of making government adjustments without consultation [00:16:33]. There is no effective opposition party, nor a foreseeable path for any opposition to win elections [00:17:00]. This situation is leading Türkiye towards apoliticization, where the vast majority of people will find political discussions boring and unnecessary [00:17:21]. Strong ideological feelings are only possible in a democratic environment with intense party competition; without it, people become tired of politics [00:18:11].

The "Islamist authoritarian ideology" has entered a period of stagnation, as its ideological promises have proven unconvincing [00:19:01]. Similarly, the "Unionist [[mustafa_kemals_political_strategies_and_legacy | Kemalist]] line" is fragmented by internal fault lines and fails to meet Turkish society's pragmatic tendencies [00:19:38]. Both ideologies are seen as entering a long-term downward trend in Türkiye [00:19:58].

Real political power now resides in opaque struggles within institutions like the Army, Interior Ministry, Intelligence Organization, and Foreign Affairs [00:20:41]. The public and even journalists are unaware of the content or nature of these conflicts, which bear no relation to traditional ideological templates like rightists vs. leftists or [[mustafa_kemals_political_strategies_and_legacy | Kemalists]] vs. Unionists [00:21:01]. Instead, they are driven by undisclosed interests and organizational preferences [00:21:52]. The public's role is merely to observe, interpret, and eventually grow weary of trying to make sense of it all [00:21:55].

### The Role of the Ministry of Interior

Friedrich Engels' observation that an "eastern government" historically had few departments (finance, war, public works) is cited [01:16:14]. These are seen as the basic functions of any traditional state: collecting taxes (like an "upper mafia") [01:17:20], engaging in war [01:17:44], and public works (to stimulate the economy, collect more taxes, and employ people) [01:17:48].

A perceived deficiency in Engels' list is the absence of a "secretariat of state" or foreign affairs, which evolved from handling correspondence [01:18:42]. Historically, the police or internal security organizations never reached their current size [01:19:31]. Similarly, the centralized administration of provinces by appointment (civil administration) is a more recent development [01:19:53].

In Türkiye, the Ministry of Interior has two distinct functions: managing internal security forces (police) and overseeing civil administration (provincial and district administrators appointed from the center) [01:20:09]. Since the establishment of the republic, the Interior Ministry and the Army have consistently been the most powerful and important state organs [01:20:35]. The opaque conflicts within the Interior Ministry are considered a continuation of this pattern [01:21:01].

## Hittite Kemal Bey

Hittite Kemal Bey is remembered as the "man in the chicken coop" [01:27:37]. He was the organizer of the Union and Progress dictatorship's popular leg in Istanbul, controlling unions and crowds [01:27:55]. He was also reportedly involved in bribery and corruption during World War I [01:28:14]. In 1926, during the arrests of Union and Progress executives under the pretext of an assassination attempt on [[mustafa_kemal_ataturks_political_appointments | Atatürk]], he was caught hiding [01:28:32]. Accounts differ on his fate: some say he was executed [01:28:45], others that he committed suicide when caught [01:29:42]. It is joked that his hiding place must have been a "pretty luxurious chicken coop" [01:29:50].

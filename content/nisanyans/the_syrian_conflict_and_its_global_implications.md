From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The current [[current_political_events_in_syria_and_international_interventions | Syrian conflict]] is a daily political topic that holds significant global implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. While some prefer discussions on historical or philosophical subjects, the speaker argues that the *approach* style, emphasizing rational, interesting, and convincing arguments, is more important than the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A balanced program includes current issues, general philosophical/theoretical topics, and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Current Situation and Lack of Information
At present, there is insufficient detailed information regarding the full scope of incidents in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Reports suggest the capture of Aleppo city and its airports, with attacks extending towards Hama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The true seriousness and permanence of these developments will only become clear in a few days, once the "dust settles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. There is a significant amount of propaganda and fake news, making it difficult to ascertain the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Syria as a Geopolitical Turning Point
If reports of a large-scale attack are true, it is considered a turning point in the Middle East War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This event also marks an important turning point in the process of great global instability, which has a high probability of escalating into a wider war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Syria's strategic importance:
*   **Key to the Middle East** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   **Key to Israel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   **Key to Iran** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> – it is Iran's gateway to the Mediterranean for both trade and military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The fall of Syria would condemn Iran to the Asian steppes, leading to its encirclement and defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Key to Russia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> – a significant blow to Russia's global power claim and the loss of its only Mediterranean base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It would also mean Russia loses the ability to "stab Türkiye in the back" in a potential future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Key to China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> – the fall of Iran (closely linked to Syria) is a "fatal incident" for China, as Iran supplies almost all of China's oil from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This would tie China's hands and make it lose its "life to foreign enemy hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

## [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Israel-Palestine Conflict]] and Regional Strategy
The [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Israeli War]] has evolved, starting with the aim of ethnic cleansing in Gaza, followed by West Bank uprisings, and then a major operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If the Syrian factor is eliminated or controlled, Hezbollah's future is compromised due to the difficulty of receiving external military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The strategy of the United States, NATO, and Israel is to first neutralize immediate dangers and then destroy Syria, which is seen as a source of these dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Israel's goals are not to establish a "Greater Israel" by invading neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Instead, Israel aims to:
*   Reduce the Arab population within its borders to a small, non-influential minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   Establish a "purebred Jewish State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   Break the backs of forces supporting the [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Palestinian resistance]] within Israel, including Iran, the Syrian regime, and military forces in southern Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   Create a circle of compliant regimes that are not a threat to Israel's diplomatic, military, commercial, and financial interests, and lack military power or air force capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey's Role]] and Unexpected Alliance
A shocking development is [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey's]] open and radical entry into the war as an ally of Israel and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This is despite years of anti-Israeli rhetoric from [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey's]] president, which has turned out to be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] has taken an active, vital role on the Syrian front as Israel's ally and patron, utilizing elements it has trained and managed for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Two possibilities are considered regarding [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey's]] actions:
1.  President Erdoğan is acting shamelessly, betraying his principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
2.  Erdoğan does not control [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_geopolitics | Turkey's]] armed forces or Syria policy; other forces surpass him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

A common analysis in the [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkish]] press suggests [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] is trying to break the Syrian regime's resistance by giving the "ESD a black eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This analysis is deemed incorrect because it ignores the broader strategies of Israel and the US in the region, positioning [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] as an independent player, which it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Another theory, that [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] is being prepared for a US withdrawal from Syria under a potential future Trump presidency, is dismissed as a "dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The US military is not expected to withdraw from the Middle East without a heavy defeat, though eventual withdrawal from Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. The Trump administration is seen as determined to escalate the Middle East war to solve Israel's security problem with a pre-existing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

A proposed deal to [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] involves leaving Southern Syria to Israel while [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] takes Northern Syria, potentially forming a TRNC-like entity under Turkish military protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

The war is seen as a carefully prepared, planned, and designed operation by Israel, following a very rational, ruthless, and determined strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Consequences for [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia]] and China
The fall of Syria, and subsequently Iran, would be a major defeat for [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]], leading to the loss of its military and diplomatic presence in the Middle East and Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This could mark the end of Putin and [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]] as a global power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The Western alliance (NATO and EU) seems to operate on the hypothesis that Russia's economic and military power is a "paper tiger" and a bluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. They appear to be pushing and cornering Russia to force a countermove that they expect to fail, similar to their miscalculations in the [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukraine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

China also faces a "very serious global threat" from the fall of Syria and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. As a giant economy with limited energy resources, China relies heavily on Middle Eastern, especially Iranian, oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Losing access to this energy supply due to its control by the Western alliance would be a "disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. It is expected that [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]] will intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions: [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]] vs. [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]]
The recent events indicate a long-term conflict between [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] and [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. For two days, a "crazy storm" of hostility and blasphemy has been directed against [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] in [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russian]] social media, magazines, and television news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

Previously, despite being a NATO member, [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] pursued a "slippery and uncertain" policy of maintaining good relations with both [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russia]] and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This led to cautious language in the [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Russian]] press regarding [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. However, this has changed dramatically, with a dam-breaking hatred being spewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The long-term consequences of [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey]] joining forces with the Americans and Israelis to overthrow the Syrian regime are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

The situation is further complicated by [[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Turkey's]] relationship with the Kurdish formation in Rojava, which is described as a "puppet of the Americans," sustained by US military support and bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This makes the entire geopolitical equation "incredibly complicated and inextricably complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

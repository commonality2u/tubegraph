A speaker recounts a recent journey that included a trip to [[travel_experiences_in_marrakech_and_morocco | Morocco]] and subsequent challenges faced in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Trip Overview
The journey began with a "wonderful trip" to [[travel_experiences_in_marrakech_and_morocco | Morocco]] with a group of friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Following this, the speaker and their wife decided to travel to Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Challenges in Spain
Upon arriving in Spain, they encountered a significant challenge: they were robbed, and their passports were stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This incident led to a separation, as the speaker's wife is a Greek citizen and the speaker is an Armenian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Bureaucratic Hurdles
Their differing nationalities meant their "paths parted" for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The wife traveled to Greece, while the speaker went to Armenia, both to obtain new passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process involved dealing with "bureaucratic, nonsensical things" for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Return Home
After resolving the passport issues, the speaker returned to their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The wife, Ira, had not yet returned and was joining from Athens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The speaker mentions that the taste of the [[travel_experiences_in_marrakech_and_morocco | Morocco]] trip lingered, inspiring thoughts of future [[international_travel_experiences_in_morocco_and_southern_europe | travel experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03">[01:47:03]</a>. There is a discussion about a potential trip to [[travel_experiences_in_montenegro_and_ethiopia | Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:14">[01:47:14]</a>, and a possible Balkan tour to [[life_and_moving_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] and Sarajevo at the end of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.

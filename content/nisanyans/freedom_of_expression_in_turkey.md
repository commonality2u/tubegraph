[[freedom_of_thought_and_expression | Freedom of expression]] in Türkiye extends beyond the issue of insulting the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.

## Restrictions and Control

There are significant restrictions, particularly concerning religion, which are characterized as "absurd," "narrow," "banal," and "bigoted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. Individuals can "easily get into trouble" for their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

The media experiences "very strong political control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. Compared to Western standards, Türkiye has lower "standards of decency and legal standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. This means that expressing any sentiment that does not suit the administration or powerful figures is "very, very limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.

## Social Media and Rudeness

The rise of social media and the internet has led to a decline in the "general quality of people and the quality of culture," notably an increase in rudeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. Online platforms remove traditional boundaries of communication, allowing individuals to insult others without fear of physical or social repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. This environment fosters ignorance and a lack of respect, where rudeness is accepted as normal because there is no immediate consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.

## Historical Context

In the 1990s, there was a period of optimism in Türkiye regarding [[freedom_of_thought_and_expression | freedom of the press]] and [[freedom_of_thought_and_expression | freedom of expression]], with a perception that "the boundaries... are opening up one step more every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. This was part of a broader feeling of entering a new era and integrating with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. However, this optimism slowly gave way to pessimism in the mid-90s, leading to a feeling that "nothing will change in this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>.

## Religious Communities and the Concept of Loyalty

Religious communities in Turkey, such as the Menzil lodge, exemplify powerful dynamics of loyalty and attachment. The passing of the Sheikh of the Menzil lodge, known as Gavs, was met with an "incredible level of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The Menzil group is recognized as a "very powerful and sometimes ruthless organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, closely "intertwined with political cadres" and receiving "support from the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Millions of people are "attached to these things wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, and understanding this level of human attachment is considered crucial for comprehending human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

The essence of religion is defined as "loyalty" and "unconditional attachment to a Murshid, a pioneer and a congregation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Such attachment inevitably leads to "social and political consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, as congregations "gain social and political power," and even "financial power and even military power" in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This acquisition of power often leads to corruption and necessitates struggle with other powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Even in seemingly transcendent religions like Buddhism, political power struggles exist within monastic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Historically, monasteries have been institutions that "taken humanity from somewhere and carried it forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### The Role of the "Temple"

Despite the success of modern educational initiatives in Şirince, such as the Mathematics Village, Theater Madrasah, and Arke, in creating communities with a sense of "friendship, solidarity and cooperation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, they could not achieve the same "attraction power of a Menzil sect, a Naqshbandi or Kader dervish lodge, or even an Alevi lodge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This is attributed to the lack of a "temple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, which is considered "a very important thing to connect a community with deep love and loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. The challenge for modern society is to create a "mythology" that can "convince a person who is aware of the modern world" and build a "temple for this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Historical Religious Dynamics in Kurdistan

The Halidi movement, also known as the Naqshbandi movement in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, was revived by Mevlana Halidi in Baghdad around 1830-1840 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. His students were "almost all of them Kurds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, who then established influence in various parts of Kurdistan starting from the 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Figures like Siddik Abdullah and Sheikh Subatullah Arvasi established "oil fields" (likely referring to centers of influence or lodges) near Muş and Nurşen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

With the support of the Ottoman government, especially Abdulhamid II, these lodges "established a feudal sovereignty," becoming the "most powerful political formations in the Kurdish region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. They "almost completely wrapped the Kurdish country from top to bottom in 2-3 generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This rise occurred against the backdrop of the Tanzimat reforms and the destruction of traditional Kurdish principalities by the Ottoman Empire, leading to "great chaos and experienced an upheaval" in Eastern Turkey (Armenia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

During the period of Kurdish principalities, the majority of the population in the region, including villages in Muş, were Armenian peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. While they complained about the local rulers (mirs and beys), they were accustomed to that order. When this balance was disrupted, a "terrible period of chaos" ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The Naqshbandi lodges re-established sovereignty, and their relationship with Armenian villagers differed from that of the mirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Notably, a "very significant portion of the Armenian villagers in this region became Muslims" during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

The Ottoman government and the Abdulhamid regime appreciated the Naqshbandi sheikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. The Menzil Dergah is seen as a link in a chain extending from Halidi Baghdadi to Sebatullah, Nurşin, and Adıyaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>, bringing a "new vitality" to the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Knowledge of these dynamics is considered "ABC information that everyone who is interested in Türkiye's social structure, history and past should know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

## Religious Shifts and Identity in Turkey

The statement from a Gendarmerie General Command report suggesting that "If it were not for the wrath of Yavuz Sultan Selim, there would not have been a chance to come across a single Sunni in our beautiful Turkey today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a> is dismissed as an "idiotic" and "not true" inference from a military official <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

However, it is acknowledged that during the period from the 1490s to 1514, a "very important part of the population of Turkey raised a banner of rebellion against Sunni Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, known as Alevism or Kızılbaşlık <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. This peasant rebellion was "suppressed, destroyed, crushed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>, and "structural reforms" were developed to maintain ideological control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This led to an "artificial madrasah Islam, Sunni law, Sunni education system, artificial clerics" gaining unprecedented influence in the country's spiritual management in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. The long-term implications of whether the Alevi rebellion could have dominated the country, and if it would have led to a "Protestant Islam" or a "century-long religious war period like Germany and France," are deemed "beyond us" to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

## Religion's Role in Civilization and Society

Religion's function is not solely to enrich inner life but primarily "to organize a person's life," create "an order, a routine," and establish a "social behavior paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Historically, "religion and civilization were equal" until the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>, acting as a "management system that affects every cell and every action of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. It enabled people to live in complex social structures guided by written rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

In the era of "bookish religions," religion also served as a "science," providing an "information system that answered people's questions about nature and the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. However, this information system failed to keep pace with the "incredible developments of the last 500 years in the world of information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>, leading to a widening gap between scientific understanding and religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. Consequently, contemporary religions that adhere to old knowledge paradigms have become "the religions of the common people, the religions of the mob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>, viewed as "childish watering holes" for those without extensive knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. This is seen as a "great deficiency" and a "very serious problem" contributing to the "great spiritual crisis" and "collapse" of Western civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>, due to its inability to create an equivalent institution after rejecting religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.

## Ethnic and Cultural Identities

### Pre-1071 Turkish Presence in Anatolia

There is truth to the idea of a Turkish presence in Anatolia before 1071, but it represents a "very small share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. Understanding this requires moving beyond "idiotic formulas of modern nationalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. Some tribes from the Caucasus frequently "plundered this country" throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. Similar to how nomadic tribes from Asia Minor and Upper Mesopotamia disrupted the Mediterranean basin, some steppe tribes and those from the Caucasus periodically caused disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

Information on the ethnic affiliation of most of these tribes is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. The Scythians, mentioned in the 8th century BC, "raided and plundered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>, establishing colonies in the northeast around Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Other groups like the Sumerians likely settled around Gürün or between Kayseri and Malatya, quickly integrating into the country's fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. These groups were not focused on establishing "a settled civilization, a state, a nation state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a> but aimed to create living space, often by "loot[ing] and slaughter[ing] the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a> before adapting to the local order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

Some tribal migrations to Ahıska and Posoft after the Christian era lack sufficient evidence of being Turkish due to absence of written records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Notably, Scythian Sakhas are identified as "Iranian tribes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, with the great steppe empire primarily consisting of Iranian elements, though intertwined with Turkish elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. These migrations were "small events in terms of size" and did not significantly affect the dominant cultural structure of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.

Armenian historians mention Bulgars (Bulgarian Turks) settling in Kars around 330 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>, describing them as "very terrible, plundering people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a> who eventually became a "valuable element of the Armenian nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. It is unknown whether these "Armenianized Kars" Bulgars revived their ethnic memories when Turks invaded in 1071 or fought against them as "civilized Armenians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

The claim of finding Göktürk script inscriptions in Anatolia is dismissed as "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>, as the Göktürk script was a "royal script," "oratory script," and "ceremonial script," not widely used for daily writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>, and unlikely to appear where there was no Göktürk state or sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

### Adıyaman Gerger

Adıyaman Gerger is described as a region with "many small villages worth taking photos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. The majority of its population is "Kurdish. Sunni. Kurdish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. Gerger Castle, located outside the modern town in the original village of Gerger (now possibly Oymaklı), is a "magnificent castle" that played a significant, though brief, role in the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

Around 1071, before the arrival of the Turks, there was a "massive" migration from the Armenian country to this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. Armenian feudal rulers, like Short Vanel from Artvin Yusufeli, established principalities in the area during periods of Byzantine and Arab weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>. Vanel dominated Gerger Castle for 30-50 years, creating a state and engaging in Byzantine internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. After 1071, these Armenian rulers continued their influence for a time, eventually adapting to the new order, and many of these populations "became Kurds after a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. This historical process is characterized as "very, very entertaining" and a testament to the rich, complex history of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

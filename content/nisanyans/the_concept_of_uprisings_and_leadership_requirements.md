An uprising, such as the one observed in France in July 2023, is often characterized by widespread civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. While the French uprising, primarily involving "Arab African Prison 3 world businessmen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, was significant, it was deemed to have "no chance of such an uprising being successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> against the overwhelming power of the police, state organization, and army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Such an unequal fight is expected to "fade after a few days or after a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This specific event is seen as one of "several uprisings taking place in France at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, which also saw previous movements like the [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | Yellow Vests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Requirements for a Successful Uprising

For an uprising to be successful, it typically requires specific elements:
*   **Leadership and Organization** There needs to be a clear "leadership" and an "organization" to guide the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Political Goal** A defined "political goal" is crucial. This could involve trying to take over the country's administration or committing a massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Without a clear objective, the effort will not progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Power** The uprising must possess the "power to realize" its goals. If the police are taking prisoners, and the uprising cannot replenish its numbers, it signifies an "unequal fight" destined to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Broader Context and Implications

The prevalence of uprisings in Western countries suggests a situation where "modern Western states losing control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This loss of control is characterized by a decline in administrative power, consensus, and social acceptance, with "things are getting out of hand at a dizzying pace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Administrative cadres in the United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union countries are reportedly "in panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, lacking the "intellectual equipment, personality strength and organizational capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a> to conceptualize and address this panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. For now, their primary method of control is suppression via the police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

The situation is complicated by potential economic crises, such as a financial crisis or currency collapse, and the strong possibility of military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. When these crises overlap with existing legitimacy and administrative crises, it could lead to significant societal upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The current leadership cadres in Europe, described as an "elite educated elites urban urban life with a globalist world view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, are perceived as hostile to much of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Historically, societies have faced similar challenges. For example, the Roman Empire at the end of four centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> saw radical foreign populations not wishing to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. France itself has a history of brutal suppression of dissent, such as the massacre of Protestants (Huguenots) around 1570, who were "put all of them to the sword" and forced to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This kind of development is seen as "almost inevitable" in current situations not only in France but other countries as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

The speaker identifies a three-sided conflict within Western society:
1.  An "elite educated elites urban urban life with a globalist world view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> who prioritize spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
2.  A "big white middle" class that is increasingly marginalized and angered, resisting this new elite culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
3.  Immigrants from "3 worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

It was expected that the ruling elite would use immigrants as a "strike force" against the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> (e.g., "an alliance of Macron and Algerians against the yellow vests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>), but this has not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This indicates a [[power_dynamics_and_social_organization | complex power dynamic]] at play, suggesting Europe is "rolling towards great destruction, great chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

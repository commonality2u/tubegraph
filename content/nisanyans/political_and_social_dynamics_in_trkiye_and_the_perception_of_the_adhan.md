## Introduction: Personal Controversy and Public Reaction
The speaker recently became a trending topic in Türkiye, registered as one of the "most talked about enemies of the homeland and nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This occurred because sentences spoken three or more years ago were taken out of context and spread on [[social_media_and_political_controversies_in_trkiye | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The public reacted strongly, questioning how one could criticize the Adhan, which is considered sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Adhan: Perception and Controversy
In principle, the speaker believes no one would object to the Adhan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and a sane person would not think negatively about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even for those not religiously attached, the Adhan is a custom and tradition of people living in the same place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. A man singing a melody naturally from a height is something most people would like or dislike, or simply not care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

However, the nature of the issue changes when the Adhan is "yelled in your face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The speaker views the call to prayer recited with "Opar" (loudspeakers/amplifiers) as a [[contemporary_turkish_politics_and_islamic_influence_in_state_ideology | political attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Despite complaints to the municipality about decibel levels, the volume is not lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This is seen as a deliberate challenge to society by a segment of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, an act of rudeness against which one can do nothing because "they are strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Yelling in someone's face is considered a hostile act globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> and an attack on personal honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The speaker believes that those using loudspeakers to project the Adhan across Türkiye's streets and skies suffer from this aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, and such rudeness should be combated, potentially by banning the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The speaker states that the Adhan with loudspeakers is not an act of worship but a tradition, not a requirement of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This practice, possibly invented in the 1950s or 60s, became common after the 1980s as an expression of a "shantytown belief related to the New Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Political and Social Divisions in Türkiye
The [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | political and social landscape in Türkiye]] is marked by deep divisions rooted in its founding principles.

### Identity and the Republic's Foundation
Ottoman society was multinational, with diverse religions and societies living side-by-side under the state's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The Republic, however, claimed to be the state of only one of these societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Others were given two options: leave, or deny their identity and join the "one and only Turkish nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Initially, this seemed possible due to suppressed non-Muslims and Kurds in the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The motto "How happy is the one who says I am a Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, aimed at restoring the reputation of Anatolians, stopped working as Kurds descended from the mountains and non-Muslims had endured enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Ottoman Society and Religious Practice
Old societies, especially Ottoman society, were organized around religions, with life discipline provided by faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>. Daily, weekly, and annual rhythms of Muslims, Armenians, Greeks, and Jews were determined by their religious culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. A police force for Muslims would warn or punish those not praying or fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. However, the ruling class, living in large mansions, could bypass religious obligations due to privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>, unlike those in communities where everyone observed each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.

Ottoman society also included large numbers of Bektashi and other religious order members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a> who deemed formal religious rules unnecessary or against their traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. A significant Alevi population in Anatolia also did not comply with Sunni Islamic rules and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. Alevis had their own customs, beliefs, and religious leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>, and their loyalty to these traditions was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. Religious duties were part of the "natural life" rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>, with no recorded objections to the prayer business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>.

### Cultural Conflict in Modern Türkiye
For the last century, [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | cultural conflict]] in Türkiye has intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. Half of society perceives religious rules and obligations as an imposition or tyranny, reacting by leaving villages for cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. In contrast, Samos, where the speaker spent 4.5 years, views religion not as a political or social discussion topic, but as pervasive as "air you breathe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Customs like chapel ceremonies and keşkek distribution have existed for a thousand years without objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. This environment in Samos allows people, even Muslims raised in Türkiye, to sympathize with non-Muslim religious practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>.

### The Euphrates Divide and Tribal Structures
The Euphrates border line in Türkiye marks a significant cultural dividing line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. West of the Euphrates, a bureaucratic central administration system was established since the Byzantine period, which the Ottomans adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. The state's authority was strong here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. East of the Euphrates, the state lacked staff and administrative control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>, leading to a chaotic, anarchic governance by various Armenian, Georgian, Kurdish, and Arab elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. They formed their own political organizations and did not bow to central officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

Tribal structures, though weaker in the West, persisted in Western Anatolia until the 20th century among Turkmens and Yoruks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. However, settled peasants, the majority in the West, were generally not tribal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. In the East, principalities and allied tribes played a leading role in social life for much of the modern age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Tribal structure is a "proto-state" structure, collecting tribute and offering protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This structure emerges where the central state is weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. The speaker argues that democratic culture in Türkiye will flourish from the East, not the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>, as Easterners have not bowed down for 2000 years, making them free-spirited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-0:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### Elazığ: A Case Study in Contrasting Regions
Elazığ is perceived as a "fascist country" compared to surrounding provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. In contrast, Dersim is described as having the "most striking, the most lovely, the most in terms of human material in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>, raising mature and kind-hearted people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. Bingöl and Palu are conservative and religious but possess a "purity of heart" and are not hypocritical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The speaker admits to not having good feelings about Elazığ in general, though exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker often receives requests to comment on [[political_and_social_commentary_on_international_relations | political issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While acknowledging these requests, the focus shifts to major international developments.

## Discussion of Iranian Cinema

Before delving into [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]], the speaker discusses the film "The Salesman" by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The film is highly praised for its human sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, with the speaker considering it a masterpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is suggested that a film of such quality and depth would be impossible to make in Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, particularly due to its depiction of the nuances of human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and real human behavior patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> that are no longer seen in Western cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The film also provides insight into Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, contrasting its underlying "civilized society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> despite perceived "terrible misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> and "cheapness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Analysis of the January 6th Capitol Incident

The most significant [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | political news]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> of late originated in the [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, specifically concerning the January 6th Capitol incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This event, initially presented by the American administration as the "largest organized rebellion against the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> and a "terrible crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, is re-evaluated based on recently released security footage.

Key observations from the footage include:
*   Claims of five police officers killed were reduced to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, and the single death was not due to an object hit as claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Police officers, contrary to official narrative, appeared calm and unengaged in conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   A notable participant in costume was seen calmly walking through the Capitol building, joking and chatting with police, who even showed him the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. There was no effort to stop or apprehend him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   An individual who heavily provoked the crowd to storm the Capitol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> was never investigated, and attempts to do so were suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It was later revealed this individual had worked for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the incident was consciously and systematically orchestrated by the American police and FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> to discredit and potentially prosecute Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. The subsequent outrage from both parties in Congress over the broadcasting of these images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a> and demands for punishment of the broadcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a> are seen as evidence of a lack of true democracy in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Decline of Western Democracy

The notion of the West as a bastion of democracy is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. The speaker argues that the simple world view of "Western democracy" no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

### Greece as an Example
In Greece, an "unprecedented police terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a> is observed, with an incredibly numerous and powerful police force violently attacking social unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>, disregarding existing laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. This escalation of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a> and a state of panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a> among governing bureaucracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a> suggests an attempt to "close all the holes before that explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>, leading to a "fascist dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

### Turkey's Situation
Turkey is seen as lagging by "three or five years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a> in understanding the course of global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. The persistent insistence on being "Western" and "democrats" is considered outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

## Turkish Domestic Politics

The speaker offers commentary on Turkey's domestic political landscape, particularly regarding upcoming elections and historical events.

### March 12th Memorandum
Reflecting on the March 12th memorandum (1971) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>, the speaker recalls how the military issued a memorandum leading to the resignation of the Süleyman Demirel government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>. This was followed by a "reform government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a> and later martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>, establishing a "regime of terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>. It was later revealed that an initial leftist coup attempt on March 9th was stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>, followed by a joint platform coup, after which the leftists were eliminated, and a radical right-wing nationalist group took control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>. The speaker argues that in a country under NATO control with no autonomy in [[political_and_social_commentary_on_international_relations | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>, any such coup, even if initially leftist, would quickly revert to the "factory settings" of the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>. This pattern was also seen with the May 27th training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:42">[01:36:42]</a>, where a radical "Atatürkist" group was purged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a> and replaced by a "conservative and static order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:24">[01:37:24]</a> aligned with capitalism and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>.

### Presidential Candidacy and Election Outlook
The speaker expresses skepticism about the opposition's chances in the upcoming May elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:17">[02:14:17]</a>, despite Kılıçdaroğlu's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:21">[02:12:21]</a>. Consistency in past election results (22-26% for Kılıçdaroğlu over 11 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:41">[02:22:41]</a> suggests a need for a new factor or alternative face to change voter behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:34">[02:23:34]</a>. Doubts are raised about whether the election will truly be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a> or be fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a>, especially given the "very obvious dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. A change of government through elections against such a regime requires strong leverage, such as a public uprising, military support, or international intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12">[02:26:12]</a>. None of these conditions are currently met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>.

### Kurdish and Alevi Identity in Turkish Politics
The question of whether an Alevi or Kurdish president can be elected in Turkey is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>. The speaker argues that while individuals of Kurdish origin can hold high positions if they abandon their identity (like Turgut Özal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>, the Turkish state has historically not allowed anyone who highlights their Kurdish collective identity to hold important public office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. This policy stems from a "genetic memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a> within the governing cadres that certain groups (Alevis, Kurds) cannot be trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a> due to historical conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>. While understandable from the state's traditional perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>, this policy is deemed unsustainable and backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>, lowering the country's overall level of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>.

### Future of Political Parties
The speaker foresees the AKP party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>, now a "personal corruption organ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:31">[01:49:31]</a>, leaving the stage with Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:45">[01:49:45]</a>. The question then becomes who will lead Turkey's dominant party. Ms. Meral Akşener is seen as aspiring to this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>. Following an electoral defeat, there's a possibility that cadres from the Republican People's Party might shift to this new right-wing formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>.

## Global Geopolitical Shifts

The discussion shifts to major shifts in [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]], particularly the Saudi-Iran rapprochement.

### Saudi-Iran Rapprochement
The Saudi-Iran rapprochement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a> is described as the "final blow to American hegemony in the Middle East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. This alliance combines Saudi Arabia's financial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a> with Iran's large population, social cohesion, and military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. The fact that this rapprochement is sponsored by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a> is considered a "revolutionary event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a> that will seriously impact global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. It signifies Saudi Arabia ceasing to be an American "colony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a> and will provide Iran with crucial financial resources and trade access, fundamentally changing many things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>. This development is seen as a "nail driven into the coffin of the Western alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

### New Asian Trade Routes
Serious efforts are underway to establish a trade and transportation route that will bisect and control Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>, starting from China and extending through Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>. Turkey's geographical location places it in an indispensable position for this alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

### Turkey's International Stance
Turkey's current policy of drifting away from the Western alliance is considered a "rational," "correct," and "smart policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>, akin to leaving a "sinking ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>. The speaker believes that any future Turkish government, regardless of political alignment, would likely continue similar policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>. The West is financially exhausted and cannot offer significant economic opportunities compared to countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. The European Union, in particular, is on the verge of an "unprecedented economic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>.

The Ã‡anakkale War monuments in Gallipoli are highlighted as significant places to visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Construction and Maintenance
The monuments were constructed between 1918 and 1923, during the period when the Marmara Region was under Allied occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Through a treaty, Turkey agreed to protect and maintain these monuments, even consenting to the appointment of a foreign manager and director for their oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Nature of the Monuments
Unlike typical parks, these sites are predominantly war cemeteries for British and Allied soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Many of them resemble 19th-century parks and cemeteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. There are 15 to 20 grave sites for soldiers from the war, in addition to several Turkish monuments that were built later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Significance
The Gallipoli peninsula and its monuments are considered a valuable sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The speaker found them very impressive and surprising upon their first visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Donald Trump's election as the President of the United States on November 10, 2024, is viewed as a significant event, prompting self-criticism from observers who initially disbelieved such an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Initial Disbelief and Political Context
Despite a realistic assessment of American politics suggesting [[trump_and_the_2024_american_elections | Donald Trump]] was on a clear victory march, the speaker did not believe for a long time that he would be permitted to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This disbelief persisted until the [[political_analysis_of_trump_assassination_attempt_and_american_politics | assassination attempt]] on Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It was assumed that he would be prevented from winning through various means, including judicial actions or conspiracies, due to a perceived collapse of democracy in the United States over the last 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The cadres governing the U.S. since 2001 were thought to employ a "panic approach" where all means were permissible for political causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

While Trump's lead in recent weeks was "crazy ahead," past "frauds committed in the 2020 election" led to expectations of similar tricks or behind-the-scenes manipulations that would at least cast doubt on the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The fact that this did not happen was surprising, suggesting that efforts to "steal this election" were stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This implies that an influential group within America's ruling cadres, or a "separate e Team," desired Trump's victory, concluding that the current regime's "departure would not be good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## Reasons for Trump's Victory
Several interconnected factors are believed to have driven the "big change in public opinion" leading to Trump's election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>:
*   **Economic Helplessness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>: Despite economic growth, a large segment of American society felt helpless, unable to afford housing or hope for traditional milestones like marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Loss of Public Influence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>: There was a pervasive feeling that the public had no influence over real political, economic, or ideological decisions, which were made by a "Washington elite that has lost its course and completely bypassed the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>.
*   **Key Turning Points**:
    *   **Covid Scandal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>: This was the "first major crisis that seriously shook the country's trust in the ruling cadres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
    *   **Ukraine War** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>: An unpopular "crusade" embraced by the American state with massive budgets, which ultimately failed, leading to a strong societal perception of the administration being not only malicious but also lacking strategic intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.
    *   **Gaza Massacre** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>: This event caused an "extraordinary immorality, a moral crisis," exacerbated by the government ignoring public opinion and using coercive measures to suppress pro-Palestinian views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
    *   **Challenging Traditional Values** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>: The imposition of views challenging "generally accepted for hundreds or even thousands of years" values on young children in schools caused "great outrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

These factors culminated in the perception of a "morally rotten, incompetent, tyrannical and insensitive regime" running the country, leading people to support Trump as the face of the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

## Trump's Coalition
Trump's ascent to power was facilitated by a "very interesting, very unexpected coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. He garnered support from influential figures such as [[elon_musk_influence_on_politics | Elon Musk]], Peter Thiel, and Akman, who are considered "leaders of the digital age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The "irrational reactions" towards Elon Musk are seen as rooted in the perception that he is "betraying his own class," particularly the "university graduate liberal and Wok group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. The Republican Party may also gain a new ideology through this coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

## Sustainability of the Coalition and Trump's Power
Skepticism exists regarding the sustainability of this coalition, with a lack of trust in Trump himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. There are questions about potential conflicts between Trump and figures like Elon Musk or JD Vance, especially concerning cabinet appointments, laws, budgets, or wars with Russia, Iran, or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. Concerns are raised about Elon Musk's actual power within such a conflict, with some believing he would be "squashed like a fly" by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. The speaker anticipates that conflicts of interest are inevitable even among close associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:19">[02:33:19]</a>. However, it is not expected that the Trump coalition will initiate "enormous reforms and redesign the American state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.

## Impact on US and Europe
The election is viewed as a significant defeat for the "neocon team" that has governed the United States and its allied countries for the past 25-26 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>. This team consolidated power through events like the 2001 "coup" and the establishment of institutions like the Ministry of Homeland Security, and they allegedly turned Trump into a "puppet" during his first term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:34">[02:43:34]</a>. Their recent arrogance and overreach led to their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:49">[02:54:49]</a>.

This elimination of the neocon team is predicted to cause a "tremendous chain reaction" in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>. Current ruling blocs in Europe, whose cadres were largely appointed by this U.S. team, are expected to be toppled one after another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>. Examples include the German government's collapse (Maria Zaharova's description of Germany as a "banana republic" is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:43">[03:07:43]</a>), the UK government's instability, and uncertainty about the Macron regime in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>. The position of Ursula von der Leyen is also seriously questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>. Furthermore, countless "propaganda officers disguised as journalists" and NGOs financed by the American state, particularly in [[election_results_and_political_analysis_in_trkiye | TÃ¼rkiye]], are expected to lose their influence and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>.

## Future of the Ukraine War under Trump
Regarding the Ukraine War, NATO's initial investments are seen as having condemned them to defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. The current strategy for minimizing loss involves prolonging the war and obscuring its outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. Another possibility is expanding the war to new fronts in countries like Poland, Estonia, and Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. The speaker suggests that if the Biden-Kamala Harris team had continued, there was a strong possibility of them expanding the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>. Hope is expressed that Trump will not make a move to expand the conflict if he cannot "finish" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>.

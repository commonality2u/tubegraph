Türkiye's geopolitical position and internal dynamics have been subjects of significant discussion, particularly concerning its role in regional and global conflicts and its internal political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Türkiye's Role in Geopolitical Conflicts

The idea of using Türkiye as a "battering ram" against Russia, similar to how Ukraine is currently being used, has been raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This perspective suggests a Western strategy to create a united front against Russia, extending from Finland and Sweden to Poland, Ukraine, and potentially Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Ukraine War and Türkiye's Position
The speaker suggests that the [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | 2013 events]] in Türkiye, including the 17-25 December investigations, and the [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | July 15 coup attempt]], might have been part of a broader plan by the USA and CIA to instigate a [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | regime change in Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The aim was to transform Türkiye into a "black state like Ukraine" and set it against Russia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
However, Türkiye is seen as having "spoiled this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

Regarding the Ukraine War, Russia's stance is described as "extremely clear" and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. Key points include:
*   Russia has legally annexed four major provinces in Ukraine, in addition to Crimea, making them part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   Retreating from these annexed territories is deemed "impossible" for Russia and would lead to its disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   The argument is made that these are "historically Russian lands" with an "overwhelmingly Russian" population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   The initial Russian war aim was to deliver a "heavy slap" to Ukraine, break its will, and force it to give up its NATO aspirations, ceasing to be a threat to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   The speaker believes that Ukraine's existence as a state should be terminated, viewing it as an "artificial state" established by the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   A "rational solution" proposed is for Western Ukraine to be given to Poland, either directly or as a special region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This would serve Russia's interests by potentially leading to Ukraine abandoning NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   The speaker states that "the result of this Ukraine War is clear" and has "never been in doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. Ukraine cannot defeat Russia due to Russia's size, stronger industry, military tradition, and nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Ukraine is seen as having been "encouraged to a war where it would be defeated and is being defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This is likened to the Greeks being encouraged to fight Türkiye in 1919 and then being abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### Historical Context: The Ottoman Caliphate
The concept of the Caliphate in Türkiye is discussed, noting that its diplomatic and political significance is a modern development, dating to the late 18th century as the Ottoman Empire began to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. The Ottoman claim to the Caliphate became a tool for projecting power beyond its borders, particularly as it lost territory like Crimea to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire, as the "only convincing big Sunni Muslim state in the world," used the Caliphate to foster solidarity among Muslim populations under British, French, and Russian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. This was an "extremely modern, extremely unique imperial policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

However, the Caliphate claim "collapsed in 1914" when calls for revolt against British and French rule were largely ignored by Muslims in India, Algeria, and Bukhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. The claim was never truly accepted, especially by Arab countries and the Sharif of Mecca, who upheld the Islamic legal requirement for the Caliph to be from the Quraysh tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

Today, the speaker argues that the Caliphate in Türkiye is "out of the question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. With nearly 50 Sunni states, some stronger than Türkiye (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Pakistan), and others like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, unwilling to accept Türkiye's control, there is no possibility for Türkiye to assume the Caliphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. The Ottoman Caliphate policy was, ironically, pursued during a time when the Ottoman Empire was more cosmopolitan and secular than modern Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

### The Refugee Situation
The discussion touches upon the global issue of refugees, with a particular focus on the speaker's experiences in Samos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. Initially, the people of Samos "wholeheartedly opened their homes" to refugees in 2015, but this sentiment shifted to "terrible hostility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.
The speaker explains this reaction as understandable when a society "is subjected to an invasion of this magnitude," threatening their lifestyle and traditions, leading to "racism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>. This is presented as a "universal thing" observed in France, England, and Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>.

Despite the negative reactions, the reality is that these people cannot be "thrown back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. The rational and moral approach, according to the speaker, is to consider "how do we assimilate them in the most harmless way, how do we integrate them, make them a part of this society" to minimize harm to both the host society and the refugees' children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>. Demagogic and immoral figures are criticized for promoting fear and division, rather than seeking solutions to integrate refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:53">[01:30:53]</a>.

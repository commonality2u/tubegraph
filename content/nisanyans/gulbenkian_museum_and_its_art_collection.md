The Gulbenkian Museum is considered a cultural masterpiece of Lisbon, Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:10">[03:01:10]</a>. Its foundation is central to Lisbon's [[cultural_life_and_museums_in_moscow | cultural life]], financing a significant portion of the city's [[the_role_of_art_and_culture_in_society | cultural activities]], including symphony orchestras, exhibitions, and concerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:10">[07:41:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:10">[07:49:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:10">[07:54:10]</a>. The museum is renowned for being "full of masterpieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:10">[07:34:10]</a>.

## Calouste Gulbenkian: The Founder

Calouste Gulbenkian, the museum's namesake, was born and raised in Istanbul, though his family originated from Kayseri, in what is now Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:10">[03:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:10">[03:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:10">[03:19:10]</a>. His family, including a large part of it, lived in Istanbul until a generation ago, with a family cemetery located at Yedikule Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:10">[11:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:10">[11:40:10]</a>.

Gulbenkian's wealth originated from his father, an early investor in Baku Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:10">[03:24:10]</a>. Calouste himself, after studying at Robert College and Oxford, became a petroleum engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:10">[03:39:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:10">[03:43:10]</a>. He played a crucial role in the establishment of Iraq Petroleum, merging the Royal Dutch oil exploration company with Shell, and securing a 5% share for himself due to his intermediary services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:10">[04:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:10">[04:42:10]</a>. He also ensured Sultan Abdulhamid became a partner with a certain share in the name of the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:10">[04:36:10]</a>.

During the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian Genocide]], Gulbenkian barely saved his life by managing to go abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:10">[04:55:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:10">[05:01:10]</a>. He spent the rest of his life primarily in France and England, eventually settling in Lisbon in 1945 due to his disillusionment with the British and French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:10">[05:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:10">[11:59:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:10">[12:34:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:10">[12:42:10]</a>. He held British citizenship and was an influential figure in British administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:10">[11:49:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:10">[11:52:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:10">[11:57:10]</a>.

## The Art Collection

Gulbenkian dedicated a portion of his immense fortune to creating the largest private art collection in the world at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:10">[05:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:10">[05:55:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:10">[06:02:10]</a>. He considered the collection his "child" and belonging to "children," choosing each piece with love and based on his personal preferences rather than external opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:10">[06:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:10">[06:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:10">[06:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:10">[06:26:10]</a>.

The collection is notable for its dual focus:
*   **Eastern Works / Islamic Art:** Nearly half of the museum's collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:10">[08:35:10]</a>. It includes an extraordinary tile collection (similar to Ä°znik tiles), a remarkable fabric collection, carpets, miniatures, and illuminated books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:10">[08:47:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:10">[08:52:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:10">[08:56:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:10">[09:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:10">[09:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:10">[09:11:10]</a>. The Islamic art section is considered one of the most valuable collections in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:10">[10:31:10]</a>.
*   **Western Works:** The other half features Western [[art_history_focusing_on_baroque_and_rococo_styles | art]] from various periods, including works by masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, and impressionists like Rodin (sculptures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:10">[09:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:10">[09:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:10">[09:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:10">[09:31:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:10">[09:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:10">[09:41:10]</a>.

The collection offers a distinct experience compared to state-run museums like the Hermitage, feeling "more humane" and reflective of the collector's personality and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:10">[10:48:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:10">[11:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:10">[11:09:10]</a>.

## Philanthropic Vision

Beyond art, Gulbenkian's philanthropy extended to charity, particularly providing scholarships and educational opportunities for Armenian youth, children, and the poor, and building churches where high schools were absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:10">[05:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:10">[05:35:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:10">[05:38:10]</a>. He even established two cities in the newly formed Armenian state, one of which still bears his name and his father's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:10">[05:43:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:10">[05:47:10]</a>.

Notably, Gulbenkian offered his entire art collection and a significant portion of his foundation's money to the Turkish government around 1954-1955 for its proper preservation and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:10">[06:47:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:10">[07:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:10">[07:06:10]</a>. However, the Menderes government did not even respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:10">[07:12:10]</a>. This lack of response led him to decide to leave the Foundation to the Portuguese state, resulting in the magnificent museum in Lisbon today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:10">[07:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:10">[07:25:10]</a>. This incident is presented as a "striking example" of how the Turkish state's mentality may have been "damaged" in understanding its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:10">[08:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:10">[08:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:10">[08:25:10]</a>.

Yesterday, a referendum was held in Ireland on a symbolic issue that carried little concrete meaning, being primarily an ideological war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:57">[01:32:57]</a>.

## Proposed Constitutional Amendments
The referendum addressed two articles in the Irish constitution:
*   **Family Definition** An article protecting the family and its unity, stating that the interests of the family come before the state, was proposed for removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. The suggested replacement was "permanent togetherness," symbolically protecting unmarried opposite-sex or same-sex couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">[01:34:18]</a>.
*   **Women's Role** An article from Ireland's past, stating that women should not be forced to work outside the home, was also proposed for removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a>. This article reflected Ireland's history as a highly conservative country, influenced by the Catholic Church, until about 10-15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:54">[01:34:54]</a>.

## Expected vs. Actual Outcome
Despite the non-critical nature of the referendum's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>, the "Yes" vote was overwhelmingly supported by:
*   Ireland's two major parties, which have formed a strong two-party system since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>.
*   A third coalition member party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>, with approximately 98% of Members of Parliament in favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.
*   A vast network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and almost all public opinion organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>.
*   The entire [[social_and_political_issues_in_england | Irish]] press and media, including all columnists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>.
*   Public opinion polls, up until a week before the vote, indicated a "Yes" vote ranging from 54% to 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:43">[01:36:43]</a>.

However, the actual result was a decisive "No" vote of 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

## Implications for Democracy
This outcome is considered a very striking event, with no similar precedent in democratic countries over the last 30 to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>. It represents a radical rejection of all political actors simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>.

The speaker notes that while past referendums, like those on the European Union in the Netherlands and France, or [[social_and_political_issues_in_england | Brexit]], showed divergence from expectations, they did not involve a unanimous political class and media backing one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>. In this case, all parties, media, and polls supported "Yes," yet it resulted in a "rout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>.

The fact that the Prime Minister did not resign after such a result indicates a complete bankruptcy of the democratic structure and its underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

> "Our people have rejected us by a majority of three. Under these circumstances, I cannot govern this country. There is no politician left who has the foresight and morality. We are at a point where democracy is over in today's so-called civilized western world. We are at a point where the idea of ​​democracy has been thrown in the trash." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>

This event raises a critical question for the present age: how will a fair, reasonable, and sustainable governance system be established in the new era? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>

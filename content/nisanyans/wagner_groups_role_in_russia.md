The [[russian_military_uprising | military uprising]] in [[impressions_of_daily_life_in_russia_amidst_conflict | Russia]] captivated international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The speaker initially estimated this incident would last 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, a prediction he declared on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He later admitted he was wrong, as it concluded in 22 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. His 48-hour estimate was a "very pessimistic estimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and he acknowledged that he can be mistaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Historical Context and Characteristics of the Uprising
The speaker's estimate was based on historical patterns, noting that there are "a thousand and one things about mercenary uprisings like this in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He asserted that 99 percent of such uprisings, especially during wartime when emotions and personality clashes are high, are suppressed within 40 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, whether in the Ottoman Empire, Ancient Rome, Kurdish principalities, or World Wars I and II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The [[russian_military_uprising | Wagner Group]] is described as a force of "20,000-something people prepared for small-scale wars, a guerrilla type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. To put its size in perspective, a French commentator noted it's one-eighth of the total personnel of the Carrefour group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Crucially, the group lacks its own Air Force, logistics resources, factories, weapons production, and intelligence agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Public and Elite Reaction in Russia
[[political_and_social_impressions_of_moscow | Russia]], which the speaker describes as having "gotten out of that situation step by step" from a state where regions were controlled by mafia and young people had limited options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, generally accepts and appreciates its president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In a country with a consensus that the president saved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, a military commander's challenge to the state during wartime is "strongly rejected and cursed by the overwhelming majority of the society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The speaker asserts that those who attempt such acts are typically "hanged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The speaker criticized the Western press and its local branches for their "mess" and lack of intelligence in reporting on the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, citing prevalent narratives like "the West has completely sunk" or "[[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine]] has definitely won this war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Prigozhin's Motivations and Putin's Response
The speaker suggests that a simpler explanation for the uprising, beyond conspiracy theories, is the influence of alcohol, as "these people drink a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Prigozhin, described as an "adventurous man, a thug" who started from selling sausage sandwiches and became close to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, had a "very close father-son relationship" with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The rebellion was triggered by the decision to liquidate the [[russian_military_uprising | Wagner Group]] by July 1, connecting all its members to the Ministry of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Prigozhin perceived this as a conspiracy against him, viewing the Minister of Defense as a "stupid bureaucrat" responsible for prolonging the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Under the influence of alcohol and peer pressure, he decided to "go and meet with the boss" to "hang the robbery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This is described as a "typical behavior of warlords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, akin to Ottoman pashas who rebelled to appeal directly to the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Putin responded with a "very good speech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, declaring the uprising "treason" and stating that the perpetrators "will be executed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This was a shock because Prigozhin had not uttered a single word against Putin until that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The speaker suggests Putin made a "very smart move" by activating "the dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, which quickly ended the rebellion in 22 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The outcome was the "consolidation and strengthening of the Putin regime in every way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Underlying Sentiments
> Despite the rebellion, some of Prigozhin's criticisms were "legitimate complaints" shared by a large part of [[comparative_evaluation_of_western_and_russian_societies | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. However, during wartime, the consensus was that it was "not time for such personal complaints to rise up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. All military and civil administration personnel, high-level opposition parties, except for Putin, lined up behind him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Putin demonstrated both his determination and composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The speaker also explains that allowing Prigozhin to demonstrate for 24 hours was strategic; stopping experienced, national heroes who were just "emotional and a little stupid" would require bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, which Putin avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Historical Parallels
The speaker draws a parallel between the [[russian_military_uprising | Wagner Uprising]] and the Kornilov Affair in July 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. After a revolution in February 1917 and the establishment of a provisional government under Kerensky, the army began to disperse and disobey orders due to Bolshevik propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. General Kornilov moved army units towards Petersburg (the capital at the time) to "enlighten Kerensky" and potentially take military control, believing the central administration was losing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Kerensky's government, however, could not allow this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, and Kornilov's general was detained, turning the incident into a "Persian comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Vladimir Lenin capitalized on this, with the Bolshevik Party (which had been banned) declaring full support for the timber government against the military threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This allowed Lenin to gain power, and shortly after, they liquidated the government with a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The speaker believes Putin implicitly referenced this in his speech, meaning "it will not be like in 1917" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Speaker's Broader View
The speaker reiterates his opinion that [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Russia]] will win the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. He initially thought economic measures would destroy Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, but instead, [[impressions_of_daily_life_in_russia_amidst_conflict | Russia]] has "gotten stronger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, while Western countries "shot themselves in the foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. After the Istanbul talks were disrupted by Western influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | Russia]] changed its strategy from a quick operation to destroy the Ukrainian army to a long-term goal of "destroy[ing] the state called Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This new strategy, in place since March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, aims to consume [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine]] until it cannot continue its existence as a state, allowing [[impressions_of_daily_life_in_russia_amidst_conflict | Russia]] to "pick it like a ripe pear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The speaker predicts that the middle and east of [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine]] will join [[impressions_of_daily_life_in_russia_amidst_conflict | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. He concludes that [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine's]] armies have collapsed, its industrial infrastructure is destroyed, its financial infrastructure is burdened with insurmountable debts, and a generation of its male population has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. He believes the elimination of the "troublesome regime" in [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine]], which he compares to Nazism, is "a service to humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

When considering places to visit in Trkiye, several historical and architecturally significant sites stand out.

## Çanakkale War Monuments (Gallipoli)
The monuments related to the Çanakkale War on the Gallipoli peninsula are highly recommended and surprising places to visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These sites, including the War Cemetery of the British and Allied forces, are not merely sets but real historical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The monuments were constructed between 1918 and 1923, during the Allied occupation of the Marmara Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Under a treaty, Trkiye accepted responsibility for protecting and maintaining these sites, even appointing a foreign manager and director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Unlike typical parks, these monuments often resemble 19th-century cemeteries and parks, and there are many such sites, not just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The area contains 15-20 graves of specific War soldiers, alongside a few Turkish monuments built later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These places are considered a valuable sight that leaves a strong impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Architectural Complexes
Two significant Ottoman architectural works in Trkiye, outside of the capital, are particularly notable:

### Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne
The Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne was built during the reign of Bayezid II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It is a large Ottoman complex featuring a mosque, madrasah, and hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Although it was described as having overgrown grass and feeling unvisited in the past, its buildings were solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The complex's geometry is striking, showcasing a rational and totalitarian understanding of art, characteristic of high-period [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | Ottoman architecture]] and [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | Islamic architecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This understanding of art is abstract, rational, and geometric, founded on producing complex structures from simple forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12]">[00:04:12]</a>. Visiting the complex can reveal the "skeleton" of Ottoman art, which is surprisingly rational and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46]">[01:11:46]</a>.

### Sokullu Complex in Payas
The Sokullu Complex in Payas is another significant Ottoman work, considered a product of the same architectural "joke" or imperial power as the Beyazidiye Complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Both complexes evoke a sense of imperial power and represent a modern understanding of architecture that minimizes ornamentation, focusing instead on a mathematical approach as a display of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## General Considerations for Tourist Guides
For those seeking to explore Trkiye, it's noted that different "schools" of thought exist regarding how much "current events" or contextual information a guide should provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Finding a balance is often attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

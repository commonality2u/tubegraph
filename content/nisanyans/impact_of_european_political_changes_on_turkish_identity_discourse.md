The discourse surrounding Turkishness as a unifying element of citizenship in Türkiye has undergone significant shifts, particularly influenced by political changes in Europe.

## Early Republic Ideology (1923-1932)

Upon the Republic's foundation in 1923, the aspiration was for Turkishness to serve as a unifying element for citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. During the initial years, throughout the 1920s until approximately 1932, the [[central_asian_theory_and_its_influence_on_turkish_identity | Central Asian theory]] was not a prevalent concept in the official state publications or among Atatürk's associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The definition of Turkishness then was inclusive, stating that anyone who adopted the Turkish language, Turkish culture, or the Turkish national ideal was considered Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Notably, non-Muslims were considered Turkish regardless of their origin, reflecting the dominant ideology of the early Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Radical Shift Post-1930s

From 1930 onwards, and especially from 1932-1933, this inclusive discourse shifted radically and rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. In the winter of 1932-1933, a history book reportedly authored by the "Great President" (implied to be Atatürk) began to circulate, introducing a racist theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This theory posited that Turks originated from Central Asia and were the founders of all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. From 1933, this became the official state ideology, as evidenced by the First Turkish Language Congress and First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

Multiple reasons are considered for this radical change, with the dominant one remaining uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Influence of European Political Winds

One significant factor was the influence of political developments in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. In 1933, Hitler's ascent to power in Germany fundamentally altered global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. In 1923, Türkiye considered two primary models: the Soviet model and, more significantly, the Mussolini model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The Mussolini model emphasized a society united under a single leader's will to achieve major reforms, summarized as "Italianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

From 1933 onwards, racism gained traction across Europe, with the rise of Nazi ideology shaping the perception of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The concept of "purity" became a dominant theme in global discourse, quickly influencing thinking within Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Resurgence of Previous Cadres

A second factor was the re-emergence of certain cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The [[central_asian_theory_and_its_influence_on_turkish_identity | Central Asian theory]], which posited the Turks' origin in Central Asia, was popular among cadres associated with the Turkish Hearth in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This theory, particularly Ziya Gökalp's variant of Turkism, was suppressed or "silenced" after 1922-1923, during the War of Independence and the early foundation of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, from 1932 onwards, these previously silenced cadres re-emerged, suggesting a shift in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Perceived Inadequacy of Founding Ideology

A third factor was the perception that the Republic's founding ideology was insufficient to politically unify the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It was seen as unconvincing, not "peppery enough," and lacking widespread appeal beyond educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. By 1930-1931, the regime faced turmoil, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a return to Turkism would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

It is crucial to note that the statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian ideology of the Republic's founding phase and the racist Turkist ideology introduced in the 1930s are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Unintended Consequences of Assimilation Policies

The architects of this shift seemed to believe that non-Turkish groups, such as Kurds, would assimilate, potentially within one or two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. However, these calculations did not account for the resilience of groups like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The Turkish state's and the Republican regime's "fascist dynamism" from the 1920s and early 1930s eventually weakened, preventing the full execution of the assimilation project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Instead, there was a significant migration from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The Turkish upper classes began sending their children to schools in Istanbul and Ankara and gradually left the eastern regions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This ultimately resulted in the preservation, rather than eradication, of Kurdish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Regional Parallels

Such issues are not unique to Türkiye. Many countries in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia, grapple with similar challenges in their minority policies and in the creation of artificial national histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The extensive efforts to construct national histories are a common phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. For example, recent focus has been given to Armenian national history and historiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

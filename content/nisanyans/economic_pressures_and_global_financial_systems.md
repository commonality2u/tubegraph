## Current State of Western Financial Systems
The financial world of the West, encompassing banks and state treasuries, is currently confronting a significant crisis and is on the verge of bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. Over the last two to three decades, states have engaged in uncontrollable borrowing, accumulating debts that are many times their national income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. For instance, the total debt of the United States of America is stated to be around 31 trillion dollars, or potentially 131 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. It is evident that these debts are insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. Previously, this was managed by artificially keeping unpayable interests at zero, maintaining a constantly renewed debt balance through borrowing to pay off existing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. This method can be sustained long-term as long as interest rates remain low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. However, with the explosion of inflation, interests must be increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>, rendering this debt unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a> and leading towards bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## Proposed Solution: War as a Pretext for Debt Restructuring
There is only one perceived way out of this financial predicament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. Sinking states can only implement a widespread public debt write-off in the context of a major war, using it as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. The justification would be that during a struggle for civilization and survival, "petty receivables" cannot be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. The expectation is that victory would lead to debt repayment using "treasures looted from Russia and China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. This logic suggests that war is a necessity, not merely due to military defeats (like in Ukraine), but also to provide a cover for a major financial operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

## State-Business Relations and Financial Control
In today's world, capitalism as a free market concept does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. The state acts as the primary employer and "big oppressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. Individuals and private entities generate income primarily by conducting business with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. To implement radical changes, a leader needs significant financial power that can be used freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. The public budget is often constrained by bureaucracy, making it difficult to spend money freely without accountability from bodies like courts of accountants or councils of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Therefore, establishing a special, extra-public budget (a "Treasury, Special and Special budget") is crucial for those aiming for radical, revolutionary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. The common term for creating such a budget, outside the public budget, is corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. This can be achieved through methods like charging high taxes (e.g., 50%) but offering significant reductions (e.g., 20% or 25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>, or by taking commissions and bribes (e.g., 25%) for granting business permissions, such as for building a nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

### The Problem of Revolutionary Economic Power
A parallel state structure and a parallel budget, initially established to implement revolutionary programs, can eventually become mired in a "swamp of corruption" and reach a deadlock, leading to the country transforming into an "economic gangster chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>. This illustrates the inherent dangers of unchecked economic power, even when initially intended for transformative purposes.

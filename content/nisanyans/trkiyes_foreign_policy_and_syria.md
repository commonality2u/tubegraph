Türkiye's foreign policy, particularly concerning Syria, is viewed as having made a "huge mistake" by sinking into a "quagmire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. The belief is that Türkiye "cannot and will not be able to control Damascus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## Proposed Alternative Strategies for Syria

Instead of its current path, more "logically correct" or "rational" moves for Türkiye in Syria could have been:

*   **Engaging Rojava** Türkiye's most logical move would have been to draw Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan) to its side, separating it from Syria, possibly within the framework of an agreement with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. While technically part of Syria, Rojava is not considered an Arab country, which could have made its separation from Syria tolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. This could have led to Rojava becoming a region indirectly governed by Türkiye, similar to Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Protecting Syrian Alawites** Another option was for Türkiye to become the protector and guarantor of the Syrian Alawites, as the Damascus regime clearly "cannot control the Alawites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, especially with a Russian military base present in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

## Current Policy and Obstacles

Instead of these options, Türkiye has pursued the "passion of controlling Damascus, dominating Damascus, and governing Damascus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. This project is deemed likely to "end in disappointment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Key regional powers and entities will oppose this:

*   [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Israel]] will not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   The Arab world will not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   The [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iranian government]] will not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.

If Türkiye seriously attempts to control Damascus, the regime there is expected to "fall apart and disintegrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. Ultimately, Türkiye is predicted to be "kicked in the ass and kicked out in the next 5 or 10 years" from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Considerations

Beyond Syria, a more rational foreign policy for Türkiye would involve:
*   Assuming a protective role or alliance over the former Ottoman Kurds, including those in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, but excluding Iranian Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   Taking actions to alleviate concerns and fears of countries in the Balkans with historically close ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. This cannot be achieved through "Islamic fanaticism," as it prevents Türkiye from being a "serious and reliable friend and ally in Bulgaria, Macedonia, or Albania" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

The classical policy of the Ottoman Empire, and Byzantium before it, was a "butterfly policy" – Istanbul at the center, with influence extending to Rumelia (the Balkans) and parts of the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. Türkiye's realistic expansion area in the Middle East is limited to the Kurds and Alevis, with Damascus being unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

From an external perspective, Türkiye's policies do not appear rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>. Despite the regime's actions, it receives "muted reactions" from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. However, public opinion in America, Europe, Russia, and China is generally on the side of the regime's opponents in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

## Potential Conflicts

*   **Conflict with Iran**: A conflict with [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iran]] would be "great stupidity" and "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Türkiye does not have a "serious conflict of interest in Iran" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>, and its eastern border has been stable for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. While there are frictions over the Kurdish issue, Türkiye is not expected to engage Iranian Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
    *   Previously, during Qasem Soleimani's time, Türkiye seemed fearful of Iran potentially controlling Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. This scenario, where Iran could extend to the Mediterranean and become a neighbor to Türkiye in the Hatay geography if a war broke out between [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iran]] and [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Israel]], made a conflict with Iran quite possible at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
    *   Today, such a possibility does not seem to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
    *   There is a conflict between Türkiye and [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Iran]] over Azerbaijan and Armenia, but it is not expected to escalate to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

## International Perceptions of Türkiye

Western societies, including Europe and America, are the "main determinants" in the region and will also "determine what happens in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Türkiye's allies and patrons are experiencing their own democratic upheavals, leading Türkiye to believe that openly canceling democracy might not cause "too much trouble" internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. If the European Union can sanction election cancellations in Romania or declare legitimate elections illegitimate in Georgia and Moldova, and even German state leaders can threaten to cancel elections if a certain party wins, Türkiye might follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

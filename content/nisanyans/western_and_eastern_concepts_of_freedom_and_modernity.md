This article explores the evolving [[concept_and_evolution_of_democracy_and_freedom | concept of freedom]] and modernization through a comparative lens, examining its historical development in the Western world and contrasting it with experiences in Eastern societies, including the Ottoman Empire, the Islamic world, Russia, and contemporary Saudi Arabia. The discussion also touches upon the inherent nature of political power and its consequences.

## The Nature of Political Power and Freedom

The discussion begins by observing the current state of elections, noting that it has become increasingly difficult to change governments through them, suggesting that election technology and management methods have reached a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. There's a deep skepticism about political pragmatism, where politicians might adopt "lowest admonishing discourse" without truly believing it, making it impossible to discern genuine conviction from situational necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Reflecting on the hypothetical scenario of becoming a President, a radical leader's first move should be a general amnesty, specifically for "political crimes" and "crimes of thought," but excluding crimes against women and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. To implement radical change, a leader needs accumulated power, not just authority on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This power requires:
1.  **Information:** Awareness of what is happening in the country, especially in upper echelons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
2.  **An Independent Intelligence Organization:** Directly affiliated with the leader, as existing state institutions are designed to protect the existing power balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Financial Autonomy:** A special treasury or budget outside the public budget to allow for free investment and employment, bypassing bureaucratic paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. This often involves methods like taking a percentage of business deals, which is commonly termed "corruption" but is viewed as a necessary tool for radical leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Fear, not Love:** Citing Niccolò Machiavelli, a head of state should be feared, not loved, to ensure orders are obeyed. This means being dangerous enough to "carve" those who do not show loyalty or attempt sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. Consequently, some important people might need to be "clicked" or even "killed" to set an example and instill terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>.

Ultimately, this path of revolutionary power inevitably leads to tyranny, as the tools used (intelligence, parallel budgets, intimidation) become uncontrolled forces, leading to a "spiral of tyranny" and eventually turning the revolutionary into a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

## Western Concepts of Freedom

A common definition of freedom is presented:
*   **Moral Freedom:** The ability to form one's own value judgments with one's own will and live accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.
*   **Political Freedom:** The ability to change or limit the political power one is affiliated with by one's own choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.

However, these definitions are met with skepticism:
*   Moral freedom is deemed almost impossible outside of Hollywood movies, as value judgments are largely formed by upbringing, accidents, fate, and societal currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>.
*   Political freedom, often associated with elections, is seen as a "deception" and an "illusion" because individual choice on a grand scale doesn't necessarily mean individuals have a direct say in changing a regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.

Despite this skepticism, it is affirmed that [[concept_and_evolution_of_democracy_and_freedom | political and moral freedoms]] do exist in the [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western world]] and have since emerged as a significant claim over the last 250 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.

### Three Revolutions Defining Modern Western Freedom

Modern Western freedom is argued to have emerged from three major revolutions:

1.  **The French Revolution (1789):** Symbolically marked the independence of individuals from the coercive dominance of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. This allowed individuals, especially the educated and economically privileged, to free themselves from religious obligations without blame, leading to a "great revolution" in science, knowledge, and political ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Post-World War I (1918):** Fueled by mass migration from villages to gigantic cities like London, Paris, and New York, individuals gained the "freedom to be anonymous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>. This anonymity liberated people from local identity pressures, family traditions, and moral concerns, leading to radical changes in customs, clothing (especially women's), and the normalization of extramarital affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. Art movements with shocking purposes also gained prevalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.
3.  **The 1968 Revolution:** Driven by the massive increase in university populations, this revolution led to tremendous freedom in sexual morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>. The development of birth control methods significantly reduced the risks associated with sexual intercourse, opening "new horizons for people" and creating a "new world of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.

These three steps, culminating in the liberation of sexual life, have made [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western societies]] tremendously attractive globally for 250 years, drawing people to the West as a "pole of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:00">[41:04:00]</a>. However, there's a question about the sustainability of this "freedom climb" and whether the current point has produced good results for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>. It's suggested that by completely destroying societal frameworks for freedom, societies risk "collapse and disperse," leading to a "bankruptcy point" for the West today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:02:00">[44:02:00]</a>.

### Pre-Modern Western Freedoms

Even before modernity, the West had a strong idea of freedom, dating back to Magna Carta. From the 12th and 13th centuries, Western political thought developed principles of relative freedom for powerful individuals (lords, kingdoms) against the King, based on mutual respect and boundary recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:00">[46:03:00]</a>. A key dimension was the independence of religious authority (the Church) from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>. This fragmented and chaotic European political structure meant rulers faced fierce resistance when trying to centralize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>.

## Eastern Concepts and Experiences of Modernity and Freedom

The [[comparative_evaluation_of_western_and_russian_societies | discussion]] then shifts to compare this with Eastern societies.

### Ottoman Empire and the Islamic World

The Ottoman Empire is contrasted with Europe:
*   European ruling classes (feudal lords, dynasties) were property owners whose power was not easily taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:41:00">[48:41:00]</a>. They could sign promissory notes and challenge the sultan; taxes could not be collected without parliamentary approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>.
*   Ottoman ruling classes were civil servants whose future and wealth were entirely dependent on the Sultan's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:55:00">[48:55:00]</a>.

However, the speaker notes that the pre-Ottoman Islamic world (e.g., Seljuks, "age of principalities") exhibited a structural similarity to European feudalism, with fragmented power shared among many armed feudal lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>. In terms of the relative freedom of religion against the ruler, the Islamic world even surpasses Europe, having a theoretically and legally defined area of freedom that no religious ruler could violate, and an independent clergy class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:38:00">[51:38:00]</a>. The term "military type" (mülkiye tipi) is used to denote a new style of government that emerged in Eastern and Islamic countries after the 15th century, where the ruler's power was more absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>.

### Ottoman Modernization Challenges vs. Russian Reforms

A key question is why figures like Atatürk or Mahmud II couldn't achieve the same kind of transformative, permanent reforms as Peter the Great in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

*   **Similarities:** Russia and the Ottoman Empire were similar in size, state structure, ideological problems, and development levels at the beginning of the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.
*   **Russian Success:** Russia made a significant leap in reforms, transforming the country into a major modern power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. The "engine of change" and the main mass of modernization were carried by the Russians themselves, the politically sovereign group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. New artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen were Russians or operated under a Russian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Difficulty:** In the Ottoman Empire, the leadership of change and modernization was **not** taken by the dominant state group, but by [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Christian elements]] (Greeks, Armenians, Christian Arabs, Serbs, Bulgarians), who were religiously and socially distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. These groups were highly modern, producing Western-style institutions and businesses, but they were increasingly in conflict with the political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. This growing distrust eventually escalated into "mutual massacres," meaning the groups driving modernization were also seen as "enemies of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>.

### Contemporary Eastern Modernization Claims: Saudi Arabia

Today, Saudi Arabia is presented as a new model of modernization. Despite figures like Prince Salman being labeled "moderate" in the West, he is described as ruthless (e.g., dismembering opponents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>. Saudi Arabia is making bold claims to lead modernity in the new age, evidenced by colossal architectural projects like "The New Kaaba" and "NEM," a giant desert city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12:00">[01:14:12:00]</a>. They assert that "The West is finished" and cannot even manage basic infrastructure, while they plan the cities of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14:00">[01:15:14:00]</a>.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has made radical shifts in its foreign policy, cutting ties with former patrons like England and America, aligning with Iran and Syria, and conducting trade in non-dollar currencies (e.g., Chinese money), refusing to participate in sanctions against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43:00">[01:15:43:00]</a>. This represents a declaration of independence and a claim to be "the leading power of the new age in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17:00">[01:16:17:00]</a>. They aim to determine "the next step, the next stage, the next horizon, the borders of humanity" without abandoning their Islamic identity, such as building the world's most modern building in the shape of the Kaaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45:00">[01:17:45:00]</a>. This suggests a new type of modernization that may not conform to traditional Western secularization models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04:00">[01:17:04:00]</a>.

## Global Political Dynamics and the Decline of Western Credibility

The [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | current global political dynamics]] are seen as a serious crisis for the West.

### Ukraine War and NATO's Challenges

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is highlighted as a major defeat and "disaster" for NATO and the European Union, leading to a loss of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59:00">[00:59:59:00]</a>. Specific points include:
*   The highly praised US Patriot missile system was "knocked out" by newly developed Russian missiles, exposing a weakness in America's military superiority claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20:00">[54:20:00]</a>.
*   A private military company, Wagner PMC, with limited staff, "completely destroyed" two Ukrainian corps and inflicted over 100,000 casualties on Ukrainian fighters and mercenaries, effectively defeating an alliance of 31 NATO countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04:00">[00:56:04:00]</a>.
*   Ukraine is depicted as on the verge of sudden and complete collapse, with its leader on a "world tour" while the country faces a life-or-death struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18:00">[00:58:18:00]</a>.

This situation makes an open war seem "inevitable" for NATO to regain credibility and address a looming financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50:00">[00:59:50:00]</a>.

### Western Financial Crisis

The West's financial world (banks, state treasuries) faces bankruptcy due to uncontrollable borrowing over the last 20-30 years, resulting in national debts far exceeding national income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40:00">[01:00:40:00]</a>. The artificial maintenance of zero interest rates sustained this debt, but with exploding inflation, interest rates must rise, making the debt unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08:00">[01:02:08:00]</a>. A "great war environment" is presented as the only way for states to justify informing creditors that they "cannot deal with your petty receivables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53:00">[01:02:53:00]</a>, with the hope of looting "treasures from Russia and China" to pay debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18:00">[01:03:18:00]</a>.

### NATO's Strategic Weakness

Despite the perceived necessity for war, NATO's current front lines suggest no possibility of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12:00">[01:04:12:00]</a>. This is attributed to a "classic strategic mistake": extending too far from main bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17:00">[01:04:17:00]</a>. Countries like Poland, Moldova, and Romania are logistics nightmares for NATO due to their distance from main bases, whereas Russia and China can deploy troops to the battlefield from very short distances to their production bases and population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55:00">[01:04:55:00]</a>. This indicates that the "Western world as we know it" may be coming to an end, facing a forced retreat, though it will not withdraw without a fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14:00">[01:06:14:00]</a>.

## The Concept of Democracy

The term "democracy" is discussed in the context of propaganda discourse:
*   In American propaganda, "democracy" is equated with places the West likes or considers allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32:00">[01:09:32:00]</a>.
*   Regimes like Hungary, China, or Russia, despite having strong societal support and improving living conditions, are labeled "not democracy, but massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09:00">[01:10:09:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, a country like Ukraine, where a "handful of degenerate oligarchs" govern, is called a "democracy" because it is supported by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31:00">[01:10:31:00]</a>.
*   This leads to contradictions, like Turkey being called an "illiberal democracy" despite the strong support of its majority, while Hungary is not considered a democracy at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16:00">[01:09:16:00]</a>.

This highlights how the term "democracy" is used not as a measure of popular will or societal well-being, but as an indicator of geopolitical alignment and favor.

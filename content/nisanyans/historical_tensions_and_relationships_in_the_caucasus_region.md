The Caucasus region, particularly the area encompassing modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and parts of the Middle East, has a complex history marked by both cooperation and intense conflict. Understanding these dynamics requires looking at historical alliances, ethnic compositions, and external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

## Historical Context

Historically, the region that Turkey considers its "natural hinterland" or "playground" is the old Ottoman-Byzantine geography, which includes the Balkans on one side and the Middle East or Eastern Mediterranean basin on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Turkey's historical success, stretching back through 1000 years of Byzantine history and 600 years of Ottoman history, was achieved by balancing these two wings: Orthodox Christian culture in the west (Rumelia) and the [[the_ottoman_empire_and_the_georgian_kingdoms | Islamic]] Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This unique stance allowed for a discourse valid in places like Belgrade and Thessaloniki, as well as Baghdad and Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### The "Turkish World" and its Limitations

After 1991, Turkey had an opportunity to forge connections with the newly independent republics in Central Asia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. While there are investment areas and a valuable young population in these communities, the total economic output and natural resources (excluding some oil and gas) are not substantial enough to compare with major global blocs like the Western world or the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

Despite the seeming closeness, there are strong underlying tensions and contradictions between Turkey and these countries that could become serious in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Historically, Azerbaijan has been an adversary, not a friend, to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. The future of this relationship is uncertain, especially if Turkey takes a stance sympathetic to Palestinians in a potential conflict with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

Furthermore, these Turkic republics have maintained close relations with Russia and are unlikely to fully exit Russia's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Any close cooperation between Turkey and these countries must consider the Russian factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Some Russian perspectives, particularly those aligned with Eurasianist thought, view Turkey's engagement in these regions positively, as it brings Turkey into Russia's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

The idea of a "Turkish Union" with these republics is considered a "footnote" to Turkey's primary strategic focus on the Balkans, Middle East, and Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

## Armenian and Kurdish Dynamics

[[armenian_history_and_geopolitical_struggles | Armenia]] and Kurdistan have historically overlapping geographical areas, particularly in certain regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. An important 19th-century writer, Ä°nci Cihan, noted that "the other name of Armenia is Kurdistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. While not a complete overlap (northern Armenia has no Kurds, southern Kurdistan has no Armenians), they shared a significant common zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>.

Prior to the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, there was a clear understanding of a symbiotic relationship between Armenians and Kurds in this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.
*   **Kurds:** Held military sovereignty and habits, were skilled in warfare, and dominated animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. They were seen as protectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>.
*   **Armenians:** Excelled in agriculture, trade, and civil organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. They needed Kurdish protection to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>.

This symbiosis was disrupted by the spread of capitalism and Western ideas in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Armenians distanced themselves from Kurds, and the old Kurdish aristocracy was largely eliminated by the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s-1830s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This led to the rise of less accountable Kurdish tribes who found robbing Armenians easier than cooperation, ultimately leading to their separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

Today, the existence of "Little Armenia" is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>, while Kurdistan is perceived as continuously expanding its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

### Azerbaijan and the Zangezur Corridor

[[the_current_state_of_armenianazerbaijani_relations | Azerbaijan]] is currently insisting on claims to the region historically known as Zangezur, a narrow, mountainous area in southern Armenia squeezed between Azerbaijan's main territory and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. This region has an incredibly mountainous terrain, similar to the Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

The history of the Zangezur region is bloody and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Until the 16th or 17th centuries, it had a largely isolated Mountain Armenian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. However, by the 18th century, over half of the population consisted of Azeri Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. Between 1918 and 1921, these Azeri Turks were "successfully expelled" from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>, an event Azeris have not "digested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

If Azerbaijan were to occupy this region, particularly with Turkey's cooperation, Iran would likely consider it a cause for war and intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This creates a complex three-sided dynamic between Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

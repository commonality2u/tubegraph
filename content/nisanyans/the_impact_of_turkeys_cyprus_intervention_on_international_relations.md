The Cyprus landing is annually celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>. The speaker recalls the event from 1974 as a 17-year-old, having just finished high school and preparing to go to university in America, when war broke out and airports were closed, causing panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>.

The Cyprus intervention is considered a turning point in the history of the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>.

## Reasons and Violations of International Principles

Turkey had justified reasons to intervene in Cyprus, as did Greece from its own perspective, and the international system also had its reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>. These conflicting justifications led to a confrontation, and Turkey decided to take a "very brave step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.

The intervention fundamentally challenged the post-1945 world order, which was based on the immutability of borders, a core principle of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. Until that point, with the exceptions of Palestine and Israel, the principle that "no state can take land from another state without the approval and decision of the United Nations" was a sacred rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Turkey defied and violated this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences for Turkey

After 1974, [[turkeys_relations_with_western_countries_post1974 | Turkey]] was systematically punished due to the Cyprus issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>. This intervention caused numerous troubles for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

Key impacts included:
*   **European Union Membership:** Turkey's dream of joining the European Union was largely prevented because of Cyprus, with the issue being used as a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.
*   **Armenian Genocide Issue:** The Armenian Genocide issue, which had been dormant for 50-60 years, was revived and brought forward due to the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>, creating a persistent challenge for Turkey for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>.

In the long run, the intervention appears to have been a very significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>. Even 50 years later, Turkey has not managed to legalize the actual situation in Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>. This highlights the lesson that a country must be significantly stronger to embark on foreign policy adventures, as bluffing or engaging in major endeavors with weak trump cards can lead to persistent complications from which a nation cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. Turkey has not been able to resolve this issue for 50 years, and it is expected to continue for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.

The speaker frequently encounters technical issues with their computer before live broadcasts, specifically stating, "I don't know why this is happening, it's not a problem with... I think it's a problem with the computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Recurring Computer Problems

To resolve the issue, the speaker must reboot the computer. They mention, "every week I have to do this before starting the program, I have to turn off the computer and turn it on, otherwise it doesn't work, something gets stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This routine is a source of frustration, as they find themselves "too lazy to do that, it takes too long to turn off the computer and turn it back on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The speaker also questions if their "voice is heard this time" at the very beginning of the broadcast, indicating an initial sound check possibly related to these recurring problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

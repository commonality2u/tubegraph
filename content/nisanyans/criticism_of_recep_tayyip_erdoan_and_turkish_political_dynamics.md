From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker addresses common criticisms regarding his perceived shifting stance on [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], asserting that his position has been consistent for the past three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He reviewed his past writings and comments, concluding that he has always expressed "very proper things" on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Four Basic Themes on Erdoğan's Governance

The speaker identifies four fundamental themes that characterize his long-standing analysis of [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]:

### 1. Political Genius

*   [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan]] is considered a "very smart person" and a "political genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   He consistently does the "exact opposite" of what people deemed intelligent predict, and in doing so, he wins and manages to "consolidate his power a little more every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   The speaker describes [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan's]] political maneuvering, particularly between 2013 and the 7-17 December incidents, as a "masterpiece of political science," despite acknowledging it as a "very immoral move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   The speaker admits his own past predictions about [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan's]] political decline (around 2011-2012) were incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   He contends that the "expert, educated, intellectual, civilized" segment in [[turkish_political_landscape_and_election_analysis | Türkiye]] is incapable of grasping this reality due to "political hatred or maybe even class hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This group, over 21 years, has "not learned anything" and has become "more and more stupid" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Credible Alternative

*   The speaker argues that [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan's]] 21-year hold on power is not due to the "stupidity of the Turkish people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   Instead, he faces a "scarecrow" opposition that lacks "vision," "excitement," "hope," and the ability to instill anything beyond "stale words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   The primary opposition figure is described as a man who "raises the suspicion of playing a double game with every step he takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   His partner is characterized as "the real representative of the darkest and most rotten elements of 1990s Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   This situation leads to a dilemma where voters, despite potential dislike for [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan]], are reluctant to support the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### 3. Sound Foreign Policy

*   On foreign policy, the speaker believes [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] either determines it or represents a state consensus, with the latter being more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   He states that this policy is "the right policy," acknowledging some "ridiculous mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   In a rapidly changing global landscape, [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye's]] most crucial policy goal should be to "establish and maintain its relative independence and distance" from a "Western world that is sinking before our eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   He expresses doubt that the opposition has the "will, determination and skill" to continue such policies, even if they align with a state consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 4. Sociopathic Behavior and Hate Speech

*   The speaker notes a growing antipathy towards [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan]] since his election as Mayor of Istanbul, reaching an "unbearable point" after the recent earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   He criticizes [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan's]] discourse as solely based on "spewing hatred," "hate and threats," and never saying a "good word about any person or group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   This tactic is compared to Adolf Hitler's method of turning from "nothing into a world conqueror" by building his process on hatred, finding a target, and "spew[ing] hatred at them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   The speaker believes this "hate feast" sickens people, drives them to "deepening despair," and makes "constructive thought, devotion and solidarity impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   He concludes that these four views (Erdoğan's intelligence, the terrible opposition, his sound foreign policy, and his sociopathic nature) are not contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Personal Voting Stance

Before the earthquake, the speaker's voting tendency was "50-50" between Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], with a slight inclination (51-49) towards [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. After the earthquake, he felt "Enough is enough," and his preference shifted to 51% for Kılıçdaroğlu and 49% for [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. However, seeing the "so-called opposition team" on social media repeating "same old clichés and empty words like sheep bleating," his perspective began to "shake again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. He stated that he would "naturally" vote for HDP if it was an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Criticism of the Turkish Intellectual Class and Opposition

The speaker strongly criticizes the Turkish intellectual class:

*   **Class Hatred**: Their entire culture and psychology are based on "class hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   **Dehumanization**: They fail to see a large segment of society as "human beings," viewing them as inherently "dirty cleaners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Contribution**: They cannot provide moral leadership, write substantial novels, or offer guidance to a society forced to rely on "mind-boggling norms of 1500 years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Response to Disasters**: Their attitude towards the earthquake is rooted in the idea that "Because of dirty people, everything happens to us like that. Let them die and become homeless. What's it to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## The Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet)

The speaker discusses the public outrage over a fatwa issued by the Presidency of Religious Affairs concerning sexual intercourse with adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

*   He acknowledges the fatwa was "ridiculous" and notes that the current President of Religious Affairs "displays antics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   He clarifies that the Presidency of Religious Affairs does not *issue* fatwas proactively but *answers* questions, implying "insistent and intense questions" from the people on this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
*   Furthermore, a fatwa institution is bound to answer according to "Islamic Law," a 1400-year-old collection, rather than personal opinion or moral values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   The speaker argues that questions about "kink jobs" (sex) are prominent in the "real world of real people," along with "livelihood jobs" (money) and "health jobs," constituting 90% of people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
*   He criticizes the "enlightened and educated segment" for failing to provide answers or guidance on these basic life issues, especially as Islamic answers have become "stale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. He challenges critics to offer an alternative before condemning the Diyanet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## Impact of the Earthquake on Turkish Political Dynamics

The speaker discusses the profound consequences of the February 6th earthquakes:

*   **Internal Migration**: A "very large-scale internal migration" of "5 to 10 million people" is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. If not managed, this could lead to external migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **State Budget and Security**: The state budget has been "seriously shaken," and coping with the magnitude of the disaster and maintaining security poses "huge question marks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. He likens it to the social shocks from the forced migration of 1 million Kurds in 1993, but "exceeds its size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Election Postponement**: The earthquake has effectively "shelved" the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. He warns that if elections are postponed "against the Constitution" once, it sets a precedent for future postponements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. He questions who would resist such a move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **School Closures**: The decision to close schools is seen as a "very serious pregnancy" and a "move to go into war mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. He suggests it's a pre-emptive measure against potential "political coup, internal coup, regime coup, a turmoil in universities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## Foreign Policy and International Aid

A journalist's suggestion to "marry" each of Türkiye's 10 earthquake-affected provinces to a "friendly country" (listing USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Greece) draws sharp criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

The speaker points out the shift in global infrastructure investment:
*   **China**: Any large-scale infrastructure project seen globally (e.g., in Georgia, Sri Lanka, Africa) is almost certainly funded and built by China through "very generous loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   **Arab Capital**: Large administrative or real estate speculation projects are backed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Russia**: More modest projects are often linked to Russian oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Europe**: Europeans have been "bankrupt since 2008," offering "nothing to other countries" beyond chain markets and cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. They are described as "stingy" and focused on "short-term profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   **America**: The USA "only sells weapons," offering "no other benefit to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

The speaker expresses anger and disbelief at the "ignorance" of journalists who fail to include any non-Western countries among potential helpers for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker's analysis of [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkish politics]] and [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | society]] reveals a deep skepticism towards the opposition and a critical, yet pragmatic, view of [[recep_tayyip_erdoans_governance | Erdoğan's]] political acumen and foreign policy, all while highlighting the challenges faced by [[political_changes_in_turkey | Turkey]] in a complex global and domestic environment.

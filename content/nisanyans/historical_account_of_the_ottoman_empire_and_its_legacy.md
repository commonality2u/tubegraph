The transformation and legacy of the [[History and impact of the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]] played a crucial role in shaping the modern state of Turkey. The challenges of transitioning from an imperial past to a new republic are reflected in the nation's social and political landscape.

## Early Republican Period and Social Disease

The early decades of the Turkish Republic are characterized by a period of significant social and political tension. A "social disease," with roots tracing back to the 1930s, symptomized a long-standing issue in Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This era, from 1923 to 1938, was described as a "regime of terror" where people lived in a "tunnel of fear" without knowing what could happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The expectation that freedom would come after the death of the leader (Atatürk) proved false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Instead, people "lost their honor" and "buried their personalities" with him, unable to overcome their fear and shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This psychological damage, stemming from the inability to speak freely in 1938, is considered the fundamental starting point of the social disease known as Kemalism or Ataturkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It created a "suppression of consciousness" and a deep-seated fear pushed into the subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Atatürk's Legacy and its Management

The handling of Atatürk's legacy reveals the complexities of Turkey's post-Ottoman identity.

### Attempts to Forgetting Atatürk

During the İnönü period, efforts were made to make Atatürk forgotten and to erase him from the historical and political stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. His photographs and pictures were removed from money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, and plans for a monumental grave were not started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Atatürk monuments were "renovated" and seemed to disappear from public prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Reinforcement of Atatürk's Image

However, with the change of government in 1950, a "rational policy" was adopted to avoid discussing the past, deeming it too dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Instead, the past was "put in a museum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. An Atatürk protection law was passed, his tomb was built, and he was turned into a national symbol and "pantheon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. His image returned to the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, with the hope that he would gradually be forgotten as a symbol with emptied content, on which everyone could agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Later, a "dead and buried man" was taken out of his grave and used to create division and an internal enemy within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. A "mythology about Atatürk" became increasingly absurd, turning into a "halo of holiness" used as a loyalty test for careers in academia or politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. This process was evident in the 1960s and again in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

The speaker believes that the primary reason why the Republic of Turkey's "great experiment" – the project of creating a modern state from the [[Comparison of Ottoman Empires collapse with other empires | ruins of the Ottoman Empire]] – ended in a "great fiasco" within 100 years, is the society's failure to confront the reality of Atatürk and his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

### Case of Halit Ziya Usaklıgil and Vedat

The story of Halit Ziya Usaklıgil's book "A Bitter Story" (published 1945) provides a poignant illustration of the climate of fear. Halit Ziya, a famous novelist and a symbolic representative of the [[Historical and social overview of Turkey and its evolution | Ottoman aristocracy]] during the [[Historical reflections on Ottoman Empires reforms and leadership | Tanzimat Period]] and Constitutional Monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15]">[01:54:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33]">[01:54:33]</a>, wrote the book in pain after his son Vedat's suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06]">[01:08:06]</a>. Vedat was a relative of Latife Uşaklıgil, Atatürk's former wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10]">[01:09:10]</a>. Rumors circulated that Latife and Atatürk's relationship soured due to Vedat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38]">[01:09:38]</a>.

Vedat's life spiraled after obstacles in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, leading to his suicide in 1937 while on duty at the Albanian embassy in Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45]">[01:17:45]</a>. Halit Ziya's book is described as an "extraordinary effort to protect his son's reputation and honor," but it also subtly shows his effort to protect himself due to the unpredictable consequences of any misconstrued word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19]">[01:18:19]</a>. The book highlights the great injustices Vedat faced, yet conspicuously omits the reasons for this injustice or the nature of the rumors surrounding him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35]">[01:19:35]</a>. This deliberate vagueness reflects the profound fear of direct criticism towards the state or Atatürk's circle.

## Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations

The idea of an "Ottoman Commonwealth of Nations" is suggested as a leading event for Turkey's long-term national planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. However, it cannot be established on the basis of "primitive and fanatic Islamism" or "myths of Ertuğrul and Abdulhamid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. The [[Discussion on Sociopolitical Context and the Concept of Ottoman Commonwealth | Ottoman Commonwealth of States]] was not a place that would fit the visions of Kasabalı Imam Hatip school graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

It's stressed that the [[Continuity and Change in Turkish History | Ottoman Empire]] was a continuation of Byzantium, with Byzantium having established sovereignty in the region from Belgrade to the vineyard before the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. The idea that integration in this region can be achieved with "Islamic ferocity" like in 1450 is deemed "stupidity and ignorance" in today's conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. An empire based on Islamic superiority could not be maintained in the 19th century, let alone the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

Despite these caveats, Turkey possesses attributes such as land size, central location in trade routes, and organizational capacity to be a successful "Central Country" beneficial to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. This concept requires thoughtful design and research into its practical feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

## Historical Scenarios and Territorial Considerations

### Ottoman Armenia

The possibility of an "Ottoman Armenia" was discussed in 1912-1914, involving granting certain autonomy to the Eastern provinces of the [[Historical conflicts and events in the Ottoman Empire and Greece | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. Its capital would likely have been Erzurum or Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. However, a separate Armenian entity existed within the Russian Empire, with its capital in Tbilisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. The idea of these two entities uniting was considered "beyond impossible," much like the modern divisions of Ukraine, Czech Republic/Slovakia, or Macedonia/Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Such sibling strife, as seen in other historical examples, tends to be the most terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

Following the Treaty of Sèvres, the possibility of an Armenian state became moot as "not a single Armenian" was left in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

### Kurdistan and National Pact Borders

The idea that Kurdistan, being a region with lower per capita income, acts as a "hindrance" or "impoverished element" for Turkey's prosperity is deemed "completely wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>. Instead, the "exploitation of the eastern provinces plays a very important role in the growth and strengthening of Turkish capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. Without the eastern provinces, Turkey might be a smaller country, comparable to Bulgaria or Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. States always aim to grow because increased sovereignty leads to greater power synergies and organizational capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

The assumption that invaders did not want to take the Kurdistan region is incorrect; the formation of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq was clear from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. While the idea of a Kurdistan came onto the agenda, no one took it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. This was due to the region's lack of sea access, its encirclement by four historically disunited enemy powers, and the absence of a ruling class or common political will to form a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. Regional principalities and tribal consciousness were much stronger than any national consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.

During the 1914-1923 period, England and France, and later America and Russia, considered many possibilities for redesigning the [[Ottoman Empire historical assessment | ruins of the Ottoman Empire]]. They concluded that the current solution was the most correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. Although figures like Major Noel advocated for a Kurdistan, their ideas were dismissed as unconvincing and ultimately right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.

Had Greece achieved a decisive military victory against the Turkish national movement in 1922, particularly by capturing Ankara, the historical trajectory of the region, and potentially wider global conflicts, could have been significantly altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Greek Aims and Operations

Initially, the international community's agreements only promised Greece the province of Izmir and the district of Ayvalık <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The landing of Greek troops in these areas on May 16, following decisions at the Paris Peace Conference, was intended as a "police operation" to maintain public order and provide a safe haven for Greek refugees deported from the Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Greek forces did not initially raise their own flags in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] in 1920, though a "stillborn" and "bargaining document," envisioned a five-year Greek occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, after which a referendum would be held, strongly implying their eventual annexation to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

However, Greek military operations in 1920 and 1921 extended far beyond these initial aims. The Greek army invaded areas such as Nazilli, Bursa, and Aydın, and in a second major wave, reached the Sakarya River, aiming to capture Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This extensive campaign was not intended for the annexation of all of Western Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Instead, it was a "punitive operation" designed to force the Ankara government to surrender, accept the [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] (or renegotiated versions), or to eliminate it entirely and deal directly with Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory

If the Greek military operation had succeeded, leading to the defeat and scattering of the Ankara government's army:

*   **Political Restructuring** The Ankara government, led by Mustafa Kemal, would have been forced to withdraw as a political player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. A London Conference would likely have been convened to reformulate the [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] based on the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Territorial Gains** Greece would have secured Izmir and the Aegean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **International Control of Istanbul** Istanbul would have come under a "consortium management" or a collective committee, in which the Greeks would have had a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Shifting [[Role of major powers in the Greco Turkish conflict | Great Power Dynamics]]** A Greek victory would have empowered England as the sole diplomatic player regarding [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]], exacerbating existing tensions and creating "an endless and bottomless conflict" between France and England, with Italy aligning with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The British would have continued to manage the region by playing Greece against [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Continued Turkish Resistance** Despite military defeat, the [[Historical conflicts and events in the Ottoman Empire and Greece | Turkish population]], which constituted the overwhelming majority, would not have passively accepted defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. An extensive and highly developed administrative class, including officers, civil servants, and intellectuals, would have continued the struggle through economic, social, political, and organizational means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Future Geopolitical Alignment** A Turkey established under British rule would likely have joined the "avengers camp," feeling wronged by World War I outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Such a Turkey would almost certainly have aligned with Germany in World War II, potentially rewriting the entire history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Factors Limiting Greek Success in a Long War

Even in the face of a hypothetical Greek victory, contemporary observers did not view a prolonged Greek success as likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While the Greek and re-established Turkish (TBMM) armies were roughly equal in number of soldiers around 190,000-200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, fundamental factors favored [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]] in a sustained conflict:

*   **Demographics and Economy** [[Comparative military and economic strengths of Greece and Turkey in 1922 | Turkey's population]] was four to five times that of Greece, and its [[Comparative military and economic strengths of Greece and Turkey in 1922 | economy]] was at least three times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. In a prolonged war, these disparities would inevitably lead to a Turkish victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. There was "no chance of Greece winning a war that lasts longer than 1-2 years against Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Administrative Capacity** [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]] possessed a highly developed administrative class, including military academy graduates, civil servants, and intellectuals, more so than Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Internal Divisions** The Greeks had a national characteristic of internal political fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Demographics of Occupied Territories** The political population in the Aegean Region was overwhelmingly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Greece's only real chance for success was a swift, decisive "lightning" operation with strong and continuous military, equipment, and financial support from England, aimed at quickly disbanding the unorganized Ankara government before it could establish a defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Once the conflict became a "frontal war" and stagnated, particularly after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece had no chance, a fact known to the British, French, and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This article details a significant translation project of an Armenian geography dictionary and its insights into [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history]], particularly concerning Eastern Turkey and the broader context of [[history_and_dynamics_of_turkisharmenian_relations | Turkish-Armenian relations]].

## The Translation Project

The speaker, currently in Montenegro, is undertaking a demanding translation project of a geography dictionary [00:00:29]. For four months, the work has been intensive, from morning until midnight, with minimal breaks [00:01:09].

The specific work being translated is a geography dictionary published by Sukiyasi in 1902 [00:01:53]. This dictionary was discovered by the translator in 2009-2010 while working on place names [00:02:06]. The original work was unfinished, with only two volumes published, totaling over 1300 pages [00:02:59]. This parallels the situation of many famous unfinished encyclopedias in Türkiye, such as the Istanbul encyclopedia [00:02:23].

### Translator's Role and Additions
The translator aims to complete some missing parts of the dictionary by utilizing the author's original sources [00:08:31]. Approximately 100-150 new items will be added [00:08:45]. Additionally, for each entry, information is provided on the current status of the place, changes in its name, explanations of various references, and source verification [00:09:02]. These additions constitute about a third of the total text of the book [00:09:05].

The original 1300-page book included sections not directly related to present-day Turkey, such as items concerning Armenia, Iran, and Russia, which have been cut [00:09:15]. This reduced the translated core to approximately 800 pages [00:09:32]. With the added comments and explanations, the final translation is expected to be around 1200-1300 pages [00:09:35]. The translation itself is estimated to be 80% complete and should finish within a month, though additions, corrections, and forewords will extend the overall completion until early summer [00:09:43].

## The Sukiyasi Geography Dictionary: A Unique Source

The dictionary is described as "an [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian dictionary]] that I find very interesting" [00:03:15]. It uniquely describes geography as a "Land of symbols and meanings," showcasing how the same physical geography can be presented through a different culture and narrative system [00:03:26].

### Focus and Perspective
The book primarily focuses on Eastern Turkey, written from an [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | Armenian perspective]], using Armenian terminology and framed within the context of [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history]] [00:04:03].

### Benefits for Turkish Understanding
Despite its Armenian perspective, the dictionary is considered "extraordinarily useful" for Turkish readers [00:04:12].
It offers:
*   **Detailed Micro-History:** It provides in-depth information about the micro-history of the region, covering every village, town, fountain, hill, and ruin [00:04:14]. Approximately 70% of the information contained within the dictionary is unavailable in Turkish sources [00:04:39].
*   **Understanding the Armenian Crisis:** For anyone interested in Ottoman history, particularly the [[history_and_dynamics_of_turkisharmenian_relations | Armenian crisis]] in the late Ottoman period, it serves as an "extraordinary source" [00:04:56]. It helps to understand the real struggles of real people in the real world, beyond "stupid clichés" [00:05:19].
*   **Entertaining Content:** The author, a priest, despite being "not a very intellectual person" and full of "terrible superstitions," includes fun stories and tales for every village and detail [00:05:24].
*   **Rich Historical Accumulation:** The dictionary draws from a "very rich accumulation of old [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | Armenian history]] sources," including *vekaynames* (chronicles) [00:06:01]. It interweaves events from the 4th, 11th, and 19th centuries in a compelling narrative [00:06:08].

### Pre-1915 Context
A crucial aspect highlighted by the translator is that the dictionary, written in 1902, 15 years before the 1915 events, portrays a "painful and terrible process" that preceded the final catastrophe [00:06:46]. It emphasizes that the 1915 incident was merely a "footnote" or the "final act" of a much longer historical struggle [00:06:48]. The speaker expresses frustration with the common misconception that [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history]] begins and ends with 1915, stating that the dictionary, written before these events, shows a far broader historical context [00:07:24].

### Challenges for the Turkish Reader
The book's references, names, and information on ceremonies and customs are highly likely to be unfamiliar to a Turkish reader, making it potentially "incomprehensible" [00:08:13]. This necessitated the translator's extensive comments and explanations for each item [00:08:21].

## The Palu Example: A Microcosm of Historical Change

The speaker shares an example from the dictionary concerning Palu, an ancient and deep-rooted town near Elazığ [00:15:07].

*   **19th Century Palu:** At the beginning of the 19th century, Palu was a town predominantly inhabited by [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]] [00:15:46].
*   **Arrival of Naqshbandi Dervishes:** Around 1828-1830, a respected Sheikh established a Naqshbandi Dervish Lodge in Palu [00:15:57]. This lodge attracted a significant influx of Zaza people, particularly from Bingöl, who settled in a new district called Upper Pazu, adjacent to Palu [00:16:14].
*   **Impact on Armenians:** The increased Zaza population led to rising insecurity, including attacks, rapes, and harassment [00:16:25]. Consequently, the Armenian population, initially small, dwindled to almost none by the end of the 19th century [00:16:32].
*   **Migration and Conversion:** The Armenians migrated to cities like Elazığ, Harput, Adana, Kayseri, and Diyarbakır [00:16:47]. Those who remained in rural areas often chose to change their religion and become "invisible" to survive, illustrating [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians]] [00:17:11].
*   **Sheikh Said Connection:** The Sheikh who established the dervish lodge was Sheikh Ali Sebki, the grandfather of Sheikh Said, a prominent leader of the 1924 Kurdish rebellion [00:17:27]. One of Sheikh Said's grandsons, Mehmet Ali Septioğlu, was also a well-known politician in Turkey in the 1970s-80s [00:17:45].
*   **Surname Origin:** The surname "Septioğlu" (Sebki) is discussed in relation to its possible origin. The word "sept" in Arabic and Ottoman refers to Shabbat (Saturday) [00:18:33]. Thus, "Sebki" could mean "observing the Sabbath," implying a Jewish origin. The speaker notes that in Arab cultures, the title "reception" (septi) has historically been used to mean Jew [00:18:43]. This anecdote highlights the complex and sometimes surprising origins of [[armenian_professions_and_surname_origins | surnames]] and titles in the region's diverse history [00:19:31].

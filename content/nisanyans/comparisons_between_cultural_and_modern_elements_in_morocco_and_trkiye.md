This article explores various cultural and modern elements observed in Morocco and offers comparisons with Trkiye, touching upon societal structures, historical preservation, and colonial influences.

## General Observations on Morocco

A recent three-week trip to Morocco, initially for group trip preparations and then an organized tour with 38 friends in the southern part of the country around Marrakesh, extended to an exploration of the northern region up to Tangier and the Strait of Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While the trip was described as magnificent, a significant drawback noted was the excessive number of tourists, particularly "European crowds," which the speaker dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Despite this, Morocco is characterized as a "docile," "humane," and "civilized" country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Modernity: Morocco vs. Trkiye

A discussion arose during the trip about whether Morocco or Trkiye is more modern and what "modern" truly signifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Urban Cleanliness and Order
Morocco's modern city parts are described as extremely clean, comparable to Europe, even in the most intricate old neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It is observed to be cleaner than Trkiye, Egypt, and Iran, suggesting an effective municipal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The city of Rabat was particularly striking for its green spaces, orderliness, and contemporary feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Modern life's conveniences and commercial services are readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Preservation of Old Cities
Unlike Trkiye, Morocco has extensively preserved its old cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Cities like Marrakesh and its Medina feature huge old neighborhoods that have been preserved in all their details, with modern structures seamlessly integrated or designed to be unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Rural Lifestyles
In southern Morocco's rural areas, villages and towns continue lifestyles from centuries ago, indicating one end of the social spectrum is less integrated into the 21st century than Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, in overall modernity, Morocco is perceived to be "a few steps ahead of Trkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Impact of Historical Colonial Influences

The [[impact_of_historical_colonial_influences_on_modernday_morocco | French rule]] in Morocco, lasting 40-50 years, has had a considerable effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. French is widely spoken, and official signs and offices are primarily in French, often not even using Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. These are seen as traces of the colonial period, bringing a "European polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Despite this, many dimensions of the traditional social order remain preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Political and Social Dynamics

### Monarchy in Morocco vs. Kemalism in Trkiye
Slogans visible throughout Morocco, like "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (Allah, the Homeland, the King), mirror the "how happy this is. The equivalent of saying I am a Turk" slogan in Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. There is widespread love for the King, with his photographs found in businesses, government offices, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Older and more conservative Moroccans do not express negative views about the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

An astonishing social equivalence is observed between "Radical 6 [King-worship]" in Morocco and "Radical Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrkism" in Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. For instance, middle-class, modern, secular-leaning women in Trkiye who are "unfailingly fanatic Kemalists" are seen as "fanatic kings" supporters in Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This suggests that the loyalty to a powerful national figure or ideology serves a similar social function in both contexts.

### The Republic's Role in Trkiye's Social Structure
The Republic of Trkiye's significant effort and success was the creation of a middle class: literate urbanites qualified for civil service or professions like law, medicine, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This "modernization" project, beginning in the 19th century, aimed to establish a middle class, which emerged in Western Europe with the Protestant Reformation and later in Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

Prior to the Republic, Ottoman society had peasants, tradesmen, warriors/administrators, and clergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. 19th-century Ottoman reforms created a non-Muslim middle class, which was subsequently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. The Republic then successfully attempted to create a new middle class of Turkish Muslim peasants and townspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This middle class became the primary advocates for Republic reforms, ideology, and Kemalism for 90 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

However, the Republic regime did not bring significant opportunity or prosperity to the large peasant and working classes until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. A major criticism is that the Republic neglected the need for a ruling elite, viewing elite education institutions with suspicion and suppressing those who thought "outside the limits" of the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This led to a society with a large middle class and proletariat but "no heads, with cut heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Despite initial hopes, the Republic is seen as having produced a "much more miserable, poor, untalented, uneducated, ignorant society" that is further behind the rest of the world than it was a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

## Cultural Distinctions and Preservation

### Fez Bazaar and Crafts
The Fez Bazaar is highlighted as a unique place globally, distinct from Marrakesh which has become "extremely touristic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Fez is a city that has retained its historical character, with breathtaking beauty at every turn, showcasing intricate doors, courtyards, palaces, and madrasahs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. These structures reveal a past civilization that was "at par with Europe" in the 15th-16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Crucially, Fez also demonstrates active manufacturing tradesmen, working as if in the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. In contrast, crafts are described as "dead in Trkiye," where even existing bazaars mainly sell factory goods with no original artisan work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. In Fez, various artisan quarters (carpenter, tile makers, lamp makers, leather workers) are active, producing high-quality handmade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. However, the average age of these craftsmen is over 50, suggesting that this handicraft tradition may decline significantly in 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Feudal Culture in Armenian and Kurdish Contexts
When discussing leadership and loyalty, a comparison is made between Turkishness and Kurdishness. Turkishness is defined by loyalty to the state, with successful Turks historically distinguishing themselves through state service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. In contrast, Kurdish culture, similar to Armenian culture, is characterized as "feudal," meaning it's based on "different opposing local small-scale political formations and their endless struggle with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This contrasts with the centralized state loyalty seen in Turkish identity. While the Armenian feudal past had fragmenting tendencies, the Kurdish feudal past lacks an equivalent to the strong unifying institution of the church, though various branches of the Naqshbandi order may serve a function towards [[religious_and_cultural_dynamics_in_turkey_and_kurdistan | making Kurds a cultural unity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This highlights distinct [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural dynamics and ethnic identities in Turkey]] and its surrounding regions.

While the general [[family_experiences_during_the_armenian_deportation | deportation]] was not widely implemented in Istanbul, a specific incident occurred on April 24, 1915, involving the arrest and exile of intellectuals, which marked the initial phase of the deportations in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This event had significant repercussions, including for the [[armenian_presence_and_cultural_figures_in_istanbul_during_early_1900s | Armenian community's cultural and intellectual life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Closure and Reopening of Armenian Schools

A direct consequence of this period was the closure of all Armenian schools in Istanbul in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This closure impacted students like the speaker's grandmother, who was in middle school at the time and had to leave due to her school, the Emir School, being shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Armenian schools in Istanbul eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Alternative Education and Language Acquisition

During the period when Armenian schools were closed, alternative educational opportunities emerged for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The speaker's grandmother, for instance, attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This experience allowed her to learn French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Mass Migration Post-1922

Following the fall of Izmir in 1922, panic spread in Istanbul, leading to a significant development: France permitted the mass [[armenian_migration_from_istanbul_to_france_post1922 | migration of Armenians from Istanbul to France]] for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This large-scale movement, where many families packed into ships in a panic, occurred in the months immediately after Izmir was taken by the Turks in September 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The speaker's family also relocated to France during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Some individuals, like the speaker's grandfather, later returned to TÃ¼rkiye and continued their [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

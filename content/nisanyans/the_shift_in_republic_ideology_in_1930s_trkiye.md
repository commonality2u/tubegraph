The foundation of the Republic of [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] in 1923 was initially based on the hope that "Turkishness" would serve as a unifying element for its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, a radical ideological shift occurred in the 1930s, profoundly altering the state's definition of national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Initial Ideology (1920s)

During the early years of the Republic, specifically throughout the 1920s until 1932, the official ideology did not promote the Central Asian theory of Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. "Turkishness" was broadly defined as embracing "anyone who adopts the Turkish national ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This inclusive definition notably extended to non-Muslims, who were considered Turkish regardless of their ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Earlier, more specific Turkist theories, such as those associated with the Union and Progress movement (e.g., Ziya Gökalp's theory), were largely suppressed or "silenced" after 1922-23 during the republic's founding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## The Radical Shift (Post-1930)

A significant change in the state's ideology occurred from 1932-33 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This shift involved the adoption of a racist theory, asserting that Turks originated from Central Asia and were responsible for founding all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. This new perspective quickly became the official state ideology, prominently featured in events like the First Turkish Language Congress and the First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The ideology evolved into a "statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Reasons for the Ideological Shift

Three primary reasons are considered for this radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>:

1.  **Influence from Europe:** The rise of Adolf Hitler to power in Germany in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a> led to a global shift in power balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. While earlier models like the Soviet or Mussolini's (Italianism, emphasizing a single will/leader for reforms) were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, the growing prevalence of racism and the idea of "purity" in Europe after 1933, driven by Nazism, influenced [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] to adopt similar principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Return of Old Cadres:** The Central Asian theory, though popular among certain cadres (like the Turkish Hearth cadres) in the 1910s, had been silenced after 1922-23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. From 1932 onwards, these previously quieted cadres re-emerged, indicating a shift in internal political balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
3.  **Political Instability and Dissatisfaction:** The initial founding ideology of the Republic was deemed insufficient to politically hold the country together, lacking widespread appeal beyond educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Events like the Menemen incidents and growing public discontent due to the global economic crisis in 1930-31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a> led leaders to believe that a return to a more statist, leaderist, and "racist Turkist ideology" would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This new, second-phase ideology of the 1930s was distinct from the Republic's initial founding ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Unintended Outcomes

Despite the new ideology's aim to unify and assimilate, particularly minority groups, its implementation faced challenges. The hope that groups like Kurds would be assimilated "in one or two generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. The assimilation project was not fully carried out as the republican regime's "fascist dynamism" from the 1920s and early 1930s loosened its grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This led to a significant migration of upper-class families from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, resulting in a gradual decrease of their presence in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Regional Context

The challenges and ideological shifts in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] are not unique in the region. Many neighboring countries share similar struggles with minority policies and "artificial history" invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Examples include minority policies in Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia, which often demonstrate a similar "stupidity and immorality" in their approaches to national identity and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

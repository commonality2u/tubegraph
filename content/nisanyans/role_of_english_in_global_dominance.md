English is currently considered the common language of the world and is projected to maintain its position for a long time, potentially even increasing its dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. Its current prominence is a direct result of the imperial power of both the British and American empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. However, even if these imperial powers decline or weaken, the dominance of English is not expected to end, as it has become a common property of humanity, encouraging and expanding its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

## English as a Key to Global Influence

For any nation to be truly dominant on an intellectual and cultural level, contributing to the minds of humanity, it is crucial for its citizens to know flawless English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Historically, languages like Latin and Arabic once held similar positions of global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. If rising powers like Russia and China manage to seize English, like a mother tongue, they could achieve a level of intellectual and cultural dominance previously seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Required Proficiency
To hold a strong place on the world stage, citizens must know English extremely wellâ€”not merely broken or accented English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. The required level of proficiency should enable individuals to:
*   Write literature and poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>
*   Engage in major discussions and create films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>
*   Dominate social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>

### Educational and Cultural Platform
English is anticipated to remain the common cultural platform of the world for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. For individuals aspiring to be "intellectuals" (in quotation marks), the first step is to set everything aside and learn English well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>. It is also suggested that English should be encouraged more as an international education language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

## Impact of Language Policy on Regional Success
The choice of language in immigration policies significantly impacts a region's success and vibrancy.

### Case Study: Montreal vs. Toronto
Toronto is cited as one of the world's most successful cities regarding immigration outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. In contrast, Montreal, once considered North America's most enjoyable, urban, and cultured city (in the 1970s and early 80s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>, has stagnated and regressed over the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

This divergence is attributed to language policy:
*   **Montreal** (in the province of Quebec) established an agreement in the 1970s and 80s to only accept French-speaking immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This policy severely limited immigration, primarily to French-speaking African countries and Haiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. As a result, Montreal fell behind Toronto in population diversity, qualified personnel, and quality labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **Toronto** adopted a policy of accepting immigrants regardless of whether they spoke English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. This openness led to significant growth and vitality.

Canada's success in immigration policy, largely due to its language inclusivity, has prevented disastrous situations seen in some European countries like France and Italy, providing significant development opportunities for its vast, empty land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

The development of cultural and social institutions in cities with diverse immigrant populations takes time, typically a couple of generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. Nevertheless, Toronto stands as a rare example globally where such a hybrid demographic can coexist peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

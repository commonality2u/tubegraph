## Understanding Dictatorship and Tyranny
A [[understanding_the_concept_of_dictatorship | dictatorship]] is characterized by the actions of a "monster in human clothing, a raving, foaming dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rebelling against tyranny is not only a right but "something that adds meaning and polarity to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It is legitimate to use violence against tyranny and rape, and those who advocate for only peaceful means are often "on the side of authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, disguised as being non-violent but supporting the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Contemporary Case Study: Türkiye
In Türkiye, the law has been "completely torn apart" in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> and has become "the toy of a tyrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While law has always been problematic in Türkiye, there was once a belief in justice, which has now been "completely shattered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The Ekrem İmamoğlu incident is seen as merely "a drop in the bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, with many people unlawfully imprisoned by the "order of the palace, by the order of a sullen and merciless tyrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, including Osman Kavala, Ahmet Altan, and Salahattin Demirtaş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The concept of popular will and vote, which underpins government legitimacy, is being "destroyed visibly and systematically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The government's only goal appears to be maintaining its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This has led to stolen hopes for the youth, creating a "great social crisis" rather than just a political one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Maintaining Power in Türkiye
The speaker expresses astonishment at those who believe President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will leave power through elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The "book of democracy" in Türkiye closed in 2016, following the July 16 coup attempt, or perhaps even earlier in December 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Several reasons support this view:
1.  **Erdoğan's Discourse**: Erdoğan explicitly states that demanding a change of government is out of the question, and even "imagining a change in the government is treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. He considers any order where someone else comes to power as "illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
2.  **Absence of Arbitration Institutions**: There is no state-level arbitration institution or authorized body that could remove a dictator from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Neither the parliament, Constitutional Court, Supreme Electoral Council, nor the armed forces are seen as capable of doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Without a balance of power within state cadres, any election where Erdoğan might lose would likely be "canceled or something would happen to the opposition candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
3.  **Fear of Prosecution**: The ruling party has committed "so many actions that formally constitute a crime" that there is "no guarantee whatsoever" about what would happen to them if they lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This applies not only to the leader but also to their family, circle, collaborators, and supporting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Therefore, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan "will not leave power unless he dies or a serious amount of blood is shed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the multi-party parliamentary regime ended in Türkiye in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The Republican People's Party (CHP) now primarily serves to "continue a shadow play" and "provide a veneer of legitimacy for the regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, especially to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This function, however, appears to be diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Government Change

### Role of Armed Force vs. Street Protests
Street protests alone are not sufficient to change governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. For governments to change, it "takes force of arms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. A government can only be overthrown if an organized, armed force confronts the existing power and demands their removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. No government has "ever come down with street demonstrations under normal conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Street demonstrations can, however, serve as justification or an excuse for a coup prepared elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Historical Precedents
[[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | Historical examples]] demonstrate this:
*   **Ukraine (2014)**: People revolted and protested for weeks, but the government was overthrown by a "separate cadre completely independent of them," organized and armed by other places, taking advantage of the chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Syria (2011)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Iran (1977)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Russia (1917)**: The February Revolution saw the state suddenly "exploded" and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. This sudden collapse was unpredictable even weeks before it happened, with very few believing a revolution was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

These examples highlight that "the change of government is a matter of actual power... It is a matter of balance of arms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Global Trends in Governance

The multi-party parliamentary regime, which has been the standard of legitimacy since 1945, has "lost its function very quickly," as well as its legitimacy and credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   Security and intelligence institutions operate at their own discretion, "completely beyond the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   Money and budget management have gone beyond parliamentary control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   Foreign states and institutions have "infiltrated every level of the administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. For example, the dissolution of US AID revealed how organizations like the free press, NGOs, and research institutions in 190 countries are "financed by America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>, challenging the concept of civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

This indicates a "completely cancerous structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a> where a "shadow game" is played in the front, while the real events happen in the background, with the democratic parliamentary regime having "completely lost control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

### Rise of Oligarchy and Fascism
The world is entering a new era with different political concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>, marked by the formation of two political powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>:
1.  **Oligarchy**: A "bureaucratic network" that has reached the peak of its power and arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. This group, often Western-educated, believes in solving problems with algorithms and bureaucratic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. However, this utopia is collapsing as they "cannot manage" and bureaucracies have become too complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. They have lost connection with common sense and societal emotional infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This includes European Union administrators, the Democratic Party in the US, and administrative cadres in countries like Canada and Australia, who are in "panic" as their initiatives end in "fiasco" and they lose credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. This oligarchy has entered a [[understanding_the_concept_of_dictatorship | fascism]] that has "gradually become crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Fascism is defined as the attempt by states and bureaucracies to violently "exceed, break and penetrate" the traditional areas of freedom where the state cannot interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The Covid pandemic is cited as a prime example of fascist practices, where governments "encroached on all areas of freedom... using a fake eee epidemic as an excuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
2.  **Populist Opposition**: Political leaders who combat this oligarchic [[understanding_the_concept_of_dictatorship | dictatorship]] through populism and popular support, appealing to less-educated segments of society, the working class, and rural people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Examples include [[comparing_trump_and_erdoans_political_styles | Donald Trump]] in America and Viktor Orbán in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. However, the speaker sees their chances of success as "very weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>, especially in appealing to younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. They are unlikely to transform state functions within legitimate boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, as this era is "not the era of soft solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. Furthermore, the social segments they rely on (business people, shopkeepers, industrial workers, homeowners) lack the capacity to support radical policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### The Role of the Disaffected Youth
The most important social phenomenon in this dynamic is the "hopeless and desperate youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This "furious youth" is considered "the most dangerous being on earth and in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, and their actions will determine the future of Western societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. The world is "heading towards an explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>, and the seemingly irrational behaviors of ruling cadres are driven by fear of losing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | Historical Comparisons of Regimes]]

### Abdulhamid II's Latter Years
The current regime in Türkiye reminds the speaker of the "last years of Abdulhamid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a> (specifically 1895 to 1908) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Abdulhamid's regime was also a "dictatorial regime... that had lost its support among the people, was weary, tired, sullen, and completely alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. Like the current regime, Abdulhamid started with reformist energy and attempted to balance foreign relations, domestic issues, and the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. However, from 1895 onwards, it increasingly adopted a "policy of fear and hatred," becoming a "gloomy, angry, hateful, and isolated regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. This regime lasted 13 years before falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Its fall was not due to street demonstrations but a "military conspiracy," requiring "two military coups 9 months apart" to be fully brought down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

The government's recent "rampage" is attributed to their conclusion that "there is no use in preserving democratic appearances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

## Analysis of External Factors and Foreign Policy

### International Reactions to Türkiye's Regime
While public opinion in America, Europe, Russia, and China supports the opponents of the Turkish regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>, official reactions from abroad are "muted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This is because international observers "see very well that this movement has no chance in the short term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. The speaker also notes that Türkiye seems to have concluded that openly canceling democracy "will not cause too much trouble" internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, partly because democratic practices are shaking even in allied states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

### Türkiye's Foreign Policy
Türkiye's foreign policy is considered irrational by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   **Syria**: Türkiye made a "huge mistake in Syria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a> and has "sunk into a quagmire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, as it cannot control Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. A more logical move would have been to draw Rojava (Kurdish areas in Syria) to its side, or even become the protector of Syrian Alawites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. Instead, Türkiye pursued "dominating Damascus," which is an "obvious... project that will end in disappointment" due to opposition from Israel, the Arab world, and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **Iran**: Türkiye is unlikely to go to war against Iran, as there isn't a serious conflict of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>, and the eastern border is historically stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. While there were fears of Iran's expansion towards the Mediterranean through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon during Qasem Soleimani's time, which could have led to conflict with Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>, this situation does not seem to exist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Minor conflicts over Azerbaijan and Armenia are not expected to escalate to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Issue**: Türkiye's best strategic move would be to assume "patronage, an alliance, a protective role over the former Ottoman Kurds," encompassing Kurds in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey (excluding Iran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Balkans**: Türkiye should also alleviate concerns of countries in the Balkans with historical ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. However, this cannot be achieved with "Islamic fanaticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The classical Ottoman and Byzantine "butterfly policy" involved influence in Rumelia and parts of the Middle East, with Türkiye's realistic expansion in the Middle East limited to Kurdish and Alevi areas, excluding Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

The speaker believes that Kemalism is not being eliminated in Türkiye, but rather has been assimilated and made part of the dominant state ideology, which is now a "strange mixture of Kemalist, nationalist, Islamist and Ottomanist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

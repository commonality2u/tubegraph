[[kemalism_in_coastal_and_inland_areas_of_trkiye | Kemalism]] is widely observed in Türkiye's coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One of the primary social bases for its prevalence, particularly in inland regions, involves Greek immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Settlement Patterns of Greek Immigrants
Between 1878 and 1913, over a million immigrants, including those from Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Albania, settled in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These populations were predominantly settled in the Western parts of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Their settlement formed an arc across the Marmara Aegean Region, specifically the coastal areas of the Aegean, and the Western and Central Black Sea regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Association with Kemalism
Among these immigrant communities, the Republican People's Party and [[kemalism_in_coastal_and_inland_areas_of_trkiye | Kemalism]] demonstrate strong support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This demographic forms one of two fundamental social bases contributing to the spread of [[kemalism_in_coastal_and_inland_areas_of_trkiye | Kemalism]] in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

The concept of freedom is often discussed at an abstract level, but it is fundamentally understood as "freedom *from* something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Human will and soul are inherently free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, but freedom is restricted in society by various factors such as authorities, laws, customs, beliefs, responsibilities, moral principles, and economic realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. The demand for freedom as a political and social slogan typically arises from the desire to reduce or eliminate these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Freedom

The emergence of freedom as a fundamental value in political discourse and the central concept of political philosophy traces back to the late 17th century in England, leading into the 18th-century Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

### Freedom from Religious Authority (17th-18th Century)

The concept of "Liberty" first gained prominence in England, the Netherlands, and Germany, primarily driven by religious sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. This freedom was a demand for religious communities to be left alone by the state, rather than an individual's independence from religious authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. At this time, the idea of a person living independently of religious authority had not yet been conceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Religion was considered essential for civil life, governing education, daily routines, major life events (birth, marriage, death), and providing moral narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

By the 1810s, after the French Revolution, a new idea emerged: that elite and educated people, or intellectuals, were not obliged to submit to religious authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. This demand, initially for a minority, became a fundamental claim of [[the_evolution_and_future_of_democracy_and_capitalism | liberalism]] and libertarianism, defining the modern age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

### Freedom from Established Values and Aristocracy (Early 20th Century)

Following the First World War, a "wind of freedom" swept through Europe and the West, this time not against religion, but against the state, aristocratic remnants, and societal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This rebellion was largely driven by urban classes, especially the bankrupt middle class and relatively well-educated segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

Visible results of this period included:
*   **Clothing:** A revolution in women's clothing, with shorter skirts and hair, and the normalization of provocative attire and swimwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **Entertainment:** The shift from structured institutional gatherings to more informal social spaces like bowls and restaurants, where "no one is superior to anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Art:** The emergence of "modern art," which aimed to criticize and mock societal values rather than upholding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

This second wave of freedom, however, led to significant disasters in the first half of the 20th century, culminating in the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.

### Freedom from Bureaucracy (Mid-20th Century)

After the Second World War, particularly in the United States, a new theory emerged that identified freedom with [[the_evolution_and_future_of_democracy_and_capitalism | capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. The core of this idea was "freedom from bureaucracy" â€“ minimizing interference from state institutions like the police, tax officers, and customs officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. This became a prominent aspect of the demand for freedom in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

### Freedom from Sexual Responsibility and Information (Late 1960s)

The late 1960s witnessed a "fourth great freedom revolution," marked by university rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. This period saw an unprecedented explosion in the number of university students, making higher education a common social experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. Young people leveraged the social conditions and the disillusionment caused by the Vietnam War to demand new forms of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

This new period of freedom had two main dimensions:
*   **Freedom from sexual responsibility:** This was a sensitive but declared independence in the sexual realm, though it involved inherent dangers and long-term consequences that societies throughout history had sought to control through institutions like marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. The 1960s significantly contributed to normalizing "absolute irresponsibility in the sexual field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Freedom against information/knowledge:** A perspective developed in universities that challenged accumulated knowledge and experience, presenting "freedom against information" as a great value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. While this led to the destruction of some ossified knowledge structures in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>, its long-term consequence was a "terribly uninformed" and "ignorant generation" reaching administrative positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The speaker cautions that fighting for freedom is a process that requires careful handling, as it can have both positive and destructive consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

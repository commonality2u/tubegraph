The world is currently undergoing a "big change of evidence," with "old owners of the world" experiencing significant shifts in power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This transformation involves the formation of new economic systems and military alliances across Europe, Africa, East Asia, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Emergence of a New World Order

The speaker notes that new global dynamics are emerging at an unprecedented pace, with "steps that will go down in Arif books are being taken" every two or three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Key developments include:
*   **Syria's Re-admission to the Arab League** This is described as a "historic step" that occurred recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Shift in Persian Gulf Maritime Security** Historically, the United States navy provided maritime security in the Persian Gulf, controlling a vital waterway for East Asia's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. However, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced their withdrawal from alliances with the U.S. navy months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Last week, under China's sponsorship, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and other Gulf countries decided to form a joint naval force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This is considered a "historical transformation" likened to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Agreement on the eve of World War I and World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **New Global Financial Structures** A decision has been made to create a new currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, and a new Development Bank, equivalent to a new bank with an internal center, was established a few months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Following this, a new payment unit is being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **BRICS Expansion** Nearly 50 countries have reportedly applied to join the BRICS group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Türkiye's Position in the New Order

In these changing global conditions, Türkiye must "take its place in this movement" and its "rightful place in this newly established world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Internal Political Shifts and External Perceptions
The recent election in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] is seen as a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The composition of the new government, with a decrease in ideologically obsessive figures, is viewed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The attendance of numerous foreign heads of state at the presidential coronation ceremony is interpreted as a sign that Türkiye is "on the right path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The speaker also notes that leaders making efforts to "infuse and curb American imperialism" congratulated Tayyip Erdoğan, suggesting a significant shift in global alignment for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The appointment of Hakan Fidan as the Minister of Foreign Affairs is considered a "right step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Key Geopolitical Challenges for Türkiye
Türkiye faces significant challenges and necessary steps to navigate the changing global landscape:
*   **Withdrawal from Syria** Türkiye must withdraw its military forces from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> because, if it does not, it will "suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Türkiye cannot challenge Iran, Saudi Arabia, the entire [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Middle East]], and Russia alone, especially with shaky relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This withdrawal needs to be part of a comprehensive agreement involving issues like Rojava, mutual compensations, population exchange, and migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, potentially including an agreement between Türkiye and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Issue** A comprehensive solution regarding all dimensions of the "Turkish issue regarding the Kurdish issue" is necessary during withdrawal from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan** Obstacles related to Azerbaijan and Armenia are likely part of a broader peace agreement with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The recent visit by Armenia's head of state to Ankara is seen as a "very brave decision" and a "very smart and proper move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, indicating potential "cooking something" behind the scenes based on recent Moscow talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Strategy** Türkiye's new approach seems to indicate a move towards "more collected, more rational, less belligerent policies," signaling a "bureaucratic administration period above politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Conclusion on Türkiye's Geopolitical Trajectory
The speaker believes that steps for a "comprehensive multidimensional regional new structure" have been taken, with results expected in the coming weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The current developments are seen as the "best of what can be done" given the existing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

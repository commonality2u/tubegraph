The following article discusses the Sheikh Said rebellion and its historical context based on a Sunday chat transcript.


The Sheikh Said rebellion, which occurred in 1925, remains a highly sensitive and debated topic in Turkish society. A large segment of society, particularly Kurds, views Sheikh Said as a national hero and a respectable figure who fought for his faith and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Critiquing Narratives of Sheikh Said

There are various narratives surrounding Sheikh Said and the 1925 rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>:
*   **Kurdish National Movement Leader**: One narrative portrays him as the leader of the Kurdish national movement, awakening, and rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
*   **British Provocation**: Another suggests the British covertly provoked the Kurds to overthrow the new Turkish regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Religious Bigotry**: A third narrative labels the rebels as "bigots" or religious people who revolted for Sharia law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

### Complexity of Historical Figures
It is crucial to analyze historical characters, like Sheikh Said, from multiple perspectives, as individuals are complex beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Summarizing a person who lived for decades and achieved significant things into a single label (good, bad, immoral) is a product of advertising culture and not something an intelligent person would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

### The Aftermath of the Rebellion
Sheikh Said and his relatives were executed publicly in Diyarbakır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. The suppression of the rebellion was marked by extreme cruelty, resulting in tens of thousands killed and villages burned across the Kurdish region in early 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The new Turkish regime aimed to send a clear message of overwhelming force, surpassing even Ottoman methods of repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. In such situations, it is a basic principle not to side with the oppressor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Sheikh Said's Background
Contrary to some perceptions based on his photographs, Sheikh Said was not an ignorant village imam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. He hailed from one of the most prestigious and aristocratic families in the Kurdish geography, with a lineage and relatives who held significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This background prompts curiosity as to why such a figure would lead a rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Historical Context: Kurdish Principalities and Naqshbandi Influence
From the 16th to the early 19th century, the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, east of the Euphrates, were largely ruled by autonomous Kurdish principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. These beyliks (e.g., Hakkari, Botan, Bitlis) functioned as de facto independent states, collecting their own taxes and maintaining armies, while theoretically paying tribute to the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. More than 50 such large and small beyliks existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

During the reign of Mahmud I, the Ottomans systematically destroyed these principalities to establish central state authority, leading to a period of great chaos and anarchy in the Kurdish region from the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

### Rise of the Naqshbandi Order
Around the 1850s-1870s, an unexpected development occurred: students of the Baghdad Naqshbandi saint, Mevlana Halid, began establishing increasing sovereignty in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. Prominent figures like Sheikh Ali Set in Palu, Sheikh Sibghatullah Arvasi in Hizan, and Taha Ari in Semdinli, all claiming Seyit lineage, spread as a network of Naqshbandi sheikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

Sultan Abdulhamid actively supported these Naqshbandi lodges, as it was difficult for the Ottomans to re-establish control in the region otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. These lodges, often seizing church and monastery properties, gained significant economic and political power across the Kurdish geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. Interestingly, a significant portion of Armenian villagers supported this new phenomenon against the traditional sovereignty of churches and monasteries, with many converting to Islam and pledging allegiance to these Kurdish sheikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. This led to radical demographic transformations in areas like Hizan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

Sheikh Said was the grandson of Sheikh Ali Sepin and a revered name within this Naqshbandi organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. His family had established a sovereign structure in the Hınıs region with Ottoman support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

### The Spark of Rebellion
These powerful sheikhs and their families felt a profound sense of betrayal when the new Turkish state, post-Ottoman era, sent district governors and captains to tell them their power was obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Having established their influence in the name of and with the support of the Ottomans, they saw this as an unjust usurpation of their established authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

## Alliance with Modern Kurdish Nationalism
The 1925 rebellion is believed to have involved a unification, albeit paradoxical, of two historically antagonistic groups: the modern Kurdish national movement and the Seyit and Sheikh movement led by the Naqshbandis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. The modern Kurdish national movement, centered in Syria and led by figures like the Bedirhan brothers, comprised leaders who were often grandchildren of the old Kurdish aristocracy and embraced modern nationalist ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. If this alliance had succeeded, it is speculated that these groups, being diametrically opposed in political and social values, would likely have turned against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

April 24th is globally recognized, especially in Armenia, as the day of commemoration for the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This day is a deeply emotional event in Armenia, with the entire population of the capital city walking to the monument on a hill, including children, old, and young, creating an impressive sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The event is described as a "humanitarian event" that profoundly affects people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Events of April 24, 1915

The specific date of April 24th is not directly related to the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] itself, but rather to a political step that preceded it, which is crucial for understanding the subsequent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

On the night of April 24, 1915, in [[armenian_history_in_istanbul | Istanbul]], Erzurum, and other major cities, approximately 235 to 250 prominent figures of the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] community in the Ottoman Empire were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters – all known and influential intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A few days later, a group was sent to Ayaş and Çankırı in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While some managed to escape, others were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This operation is characterized as a "political collapse operation," a tactic seen in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The state systematically gathers information and then acts suddenly, arresting individuals regardless of their actual involvement in political matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly opposed to extremist [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian]] nationalist movements, and others with no connection to any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The goal was to eliminate the prominent figures and leaders of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Similar operations occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. In Sivas, prominent people were called to the governor's office, taken one by one to a room, killed, and thrown out of a window into a waiting car, signifying a "cleansing" of potential voices of dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## The Genesis of Mass Murder

Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This process gradually escalated, turning into a mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## On the Denial of Genocide

The speaker views the discussion of whether the events constitute [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] as a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Denying the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is seen as either ignorance of history or immorality, often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> "Denying the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is either ignorance or immorality. Most of the time, both are the same." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>

It is asserted that nearly everyone in the world, including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, acknowledges this obvious fact, except for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The Turkish state, for various reasons, systematically designed a [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] project starting around 1895, preparing its infrastructure from 1913, and implementing it in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Turkish State Policy on the Armenian Genocide

Until 1975, the Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]], not engaging in discussion, especially until 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. For 50 years, from 1915 to 1965, the Republic of Turkey's representatives implicitly acknowledged the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] but deemed it unnecessary to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### International Resurgence and Shift to Denial

The issue of the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] re-emerged on the world agenda in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union on the 50th anniversary in Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. While there were some initial murmurs in Turkey, the policy of silence was largely maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

However, after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974-75, the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] issue suddenly gained prominence in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This period saw the rise of an organization called ASALA, which began attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. In response, Turkey adopted a policy of systematic denial, considered a "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Key figures in this denial policy included Coşkun Kırca and Foreign Ministry officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Once this denial stance was adopted, Turkey found itself unable to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

This policy proved disastrous as Turkey's international standing, particularly in the Western world, declined significantly after 1974 due to the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The denial of a universally acknowledged past crime became an "impudence" and "rudeness" that served as an excuse for Western countries to provoke and hurt Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This "stupid policy" has afflicted Turkey for 45 to 47 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### A Missed Opportunity for Confrontation (2005-2011)

From 2005 to 2011, a brief window of hope emerged in Turkey for abandoning this denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. There was a growing sentiment in both right and left-wing circles, including mainstream media like Radical, Milliyet, Hürriyet, and even Yeni Şafak (an Islamic publication), to confront the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. For the first time, the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] was genuinely discussed in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Many opinion leaders acknowledged that, regardless of the term "genocide," a terrible event had occurred, leading to the misery, destruction, and expulsion of millions of [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]], who were "the real children of this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This event caused harm to Turkey and was a "shameful incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Had Turkey shown the courage to acknowledge this, it would have shed a heavy burden of hypocrisy and taken a step towards overcoming the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] incident that has been a "mental illness" for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The speaker himself actively worked until around 2014-2015 to encourage Turkey to confront this issue, viewing it as essential for Turkey's health as a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## [[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | Political and Social Implications of the Armenian Genocide]]

The [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is identified as the most significant social and political event of the 20th century in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. It fundamentally altered the composition and color of Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. It forms the primary psychological and economic basis of Turkey's political transformation and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Beyond [[armenian_genocide | Armenians]], the cleansing of Greek and Assyrian populations in different dimensions constitutes Turkey's greatest trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide_before_1915 | Historical Context Before 1915]]

The project of eliminating non-Muslim populations was advocated as early as the 1890s during the reign of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. While the Union and Progress Party initially adopted an optimistic approach after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, they soon had to return to Abdulhamid's "mentality" and "program" by 1909-1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. The Adana events of 1909 are cited as a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. By 1910-1911, the belief had solidified that a "new Turkey" could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

After the chaos of the Balkan War and the fall of the Union and Progress government in 1912, the party regained power in 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. By this time, all the plans for 1915 were ready, and the project of cleansing Anatolia of its non-Muslim population was pursued consciously and resolutely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### The "No Place to Go" Argument

Unlike the relative ease of expelling Greeks due to mutual population exchanges (e.g., Turks from Rumelia, Circassians from the Caucasus), there was no clear destination for [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Deporting [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] to Russia, an enemy in World War I, would be a disaster for the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. A high probability of losing Erzurum and Van if the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World War I meant there was no place to deport [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Initially, the idea of deporting [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] to Syria was considered, assuming Russia would leave the war and Syria would be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. However, this solution also failed, leading to the conclusion that there was "no other solution other than cleansing, other than massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This was also driven by the understanding that after the war, whether victorious or not, the international community would demand compensation for lost lands, houses, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Thousands were killed to prevent this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

## Conclusion

A healthier, calmer discussion about these events is hindered by the denial of the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. The issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. While the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] issue was used to criticize Turkey internationally, Turkey ultimately "overcame this crisis" in the sense that nothing fundamental changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. However, an opportunity to open new paths and horizons was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

The speaker details his ongoing translation project, its significance, and offers broader insights into the [[translation_and_research_challenges | challenges of translation]] in general, particularly within Türkiye.

## Ongoing Translation Project: An Armenian Geography Dictionary

For four months, the speaker has been intensively working on a translation from morning until midnight, with minimal breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He is translating a geography dictionary published by Sukiyasi in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This dictionary was discovered by him around 2009-2010 while working on place names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Nature of the Work
The dictionary is an [[translation_project_of_an_unfinished_encyclopedia | unfinished work]], similar to many famous unfinished encyclopedias in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Only two volumes, totaling over 1300 pages, were published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It is described as a very interesting Armenian dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The book describes physical geography through an Armenian cultural lens, narrative, and system of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Its subject is Eastern Türkiye, written with Armenian terminology, highlighting Armenians within the framework of Armenian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Benefits and Value
The speaker considers the book extraordinarily useful for several reasons:
*   **Unique Microhistory:** It provides detailed and in-depth information about the microhistory of the region, including every village, town, fountain, hill, and ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Untapped Information:** Approximately seventy percent of the information in the dictionary is not available in Turkish sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Understanding Ottoman History:** It is an extraordinary source for anyone interested in Ottoman history, especially the Armenian crisis, as it helps to understand the real struggles of real people without reducing them to clichés <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Entertaining Content:** The author, a priest, includes fun stories and tales about villages and details, drawing from a rich collection of old Armenian historical sources and chronicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Historical Context:** The book, written 15 years before the 1915 incident, shows that the incident was merely a "footnote" or the "final act" of a long and painful process, challenging the common narrative that Armenian history begins and ends with 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Challenges in the Translation Process
The Turkish reader would likely be "completely in the dark" regarding many references, names, ceremonies, and customs mentioned in the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. To address this, the speaker felt the need to write comments and explanations for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. He also plans to complete some missing parts by using the author's original sources and will add 100-150 new items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Additionally, the speaker provides information on the current status of places, changes in names, and explanations of various references, checking the sources. This additional text makes up about a third of the total book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Items not directly related to Türkiye (e.g., modern Armenia, Iran, Russia) have been cut, reducing the original 1300 pages to 800-something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. With his additions, the book will again be around 1200-1300 pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Approximately eighty percent of the main translation is complete, with additions and forewords expected to be finished by early summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## General State of Translation in Türkiye

The speaker believes that most recent translations in Türkiye are "disgraceful," even those by famous translators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. He calls this "fraud" and a "commercial crime" due to misleading products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. He states he has not encountered a good translation in the last 30 years and no longer reads translations into Turkish due to their incomprehensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### The "Trick" of Translation
The core "trick" of translation is to "know the language you are translating into very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. It is not enough to know the target language passively; one must have mastered the art of writing in it, ideally having written a copyrighted book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. The ability to express one's intention in the most correct, clearest, and shortest way in the target language is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

While understanding the source language is necessary, it is less critical than mastery of the target language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The level of fidelity to the original text varies depending on the type of text (e.g., legal, poetry, technical manual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The translator needs to be flexible, ensuring the idea is expressed flawlessly within the rhythms, habits, and idioms of the target language, without losing the required level of fidelity to the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

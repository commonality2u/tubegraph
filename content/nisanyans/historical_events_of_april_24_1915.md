April 24 is recognized globally, especially in Armenia, as the [[commemoration_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide Commemoration Day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. The day is highly emotional in Armenia, with large populations participating in walks to the genocide monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.

## Events of April 24, 1915

The date April 24, 1915, marks a specific political step that immediately preceded the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, an operation was launched in Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>.

During this operation:
*   Approximately 235 to 250 prominent Armenian intellectuals were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. These individuals included writers, thought leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>.
*   They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   A few days later, they were sent to two locations in Anatolia: Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>.
*   Only three to four people managed to escape; the rest were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>.
*   Similar arrests and killings of leading figures also occurred in other cities like Sivas, Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:44">[04:44:44]</a>. In Sivas, influential figures were called to the governor's office, killed, and their bodies disposed of via a cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:04">[05:04:04]</a>.

This operation aimed to silence and eliminate the political leaders and influential voices of the Armenian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:17">[05:17:17]</a>. Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:32">[05:32:32]</a>. This process escalated into a mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:47">[05:47:47]</a>.

## The Nature of the Event and Genocide Denial

The speaker asserts that denying the Armenian Genocide is either complete ignorance or immorality, often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:53">[08:53:53]</a>. It is widely acknowledged globally, except within Turkey, that the Turkish state systematically designed and implemented a genocide project from 1895 onwards, with infrastructure prepared from 1913, and put into practice in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:33">[09:33:33]</a>. The objective was to eliminate the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:03">[10:03:03]</a>.

The [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] is considered the most significant social and political event in Turkey's century-long history, fundamentally altering its societal composition, political transformation, and psychological and economic basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:44">[20:44:44]</a>. This project of cleansing Anatolia's non-Muslim population was conceived and defended since the 1890s, during the time of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:32">[21:32:32]</a>.

Initially, the [[union_and_progress_administrations_role_in_1915 | Union and Progress regime]] (CUP), which came to power in 1908 by overthrowing Abdulhamid, had an optimistic approach, believing they could solve problems without resorting to such measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:53">[21:53:53]</a>. However, after the Adana incidents of 1909, and by 1910 or 1911, the CUP leadership concluded that a new Turkish state could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:50">[22:50:50]</a>. By the time the CUP returned to power in 1913 after the Baba Hadi raid, the conditions for the 1915 events were set and consciously implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:15">[23:15:15]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Population Movements

The expulsion of Greeks was comparatively easier due to mutual population exchanges between Turkey and Greece, where over a million people were resettled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:43">[23:43:43]</a>. However, there was "no place for the Armenians to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:59">[24:59:59]</a>. Deporting Armenians to Russia and Armenia, an enemy state during World War I, would have been disastrous for the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:14">[25:14:14]</a>. The expectation of losing eastern provinces to Russia if the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World War I led to the conclusion that cleansing via massacre was the only solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:29">[25:29:29]</a>. This was done to prevent future demands for compensation or return of lands and assets from the Armenian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:37">[26:37:37]</a>.

## Turkey's Policy on the Genocide

The Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the genocide until 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:36">[10:36:36]</a>. Until 1965, the Republic of Turkey's representatives were aware of the genocide but chose not to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:56">[10:56:56]</a>. This silence was partly due to Turkey's high reputation and strategic importance in the Western world before the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:13">[12:13:13]</a>.

The issue re-emerged on the world agenda in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union and Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:39">[11:39:39]</a>. However, Turkey continued its policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:02">[12:02:02]</a>.

### Shift to Denial (Post-1974)

A significant shift occurred around 1974-1975, following Turkey's Cyprus operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:30">[12:30:30]</a>. This event led to a decline in Turkey's international standing and strained relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:45">[14:45:45]</a>. Soon after, an organization called ASALA emerged, initiating attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:47">[12:47:47]</a>. Simultaneously, the Western press "suddenly remembered" the Armenian Genocide as one of the 20th century's biggest crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:57">[12:57:57]</a>.

In response, Turkey adopted a policy of denial, believing it could ride out the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:16">[13:16:16]</a>. This denial policy was orchestrated by individuals like Cem Coşkun Kırca, Gündüz Aktan, and Kamuran İnan from the Foreign Ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:41">[13:41:41]</a>. The speaker views this as a "stupid policy" that provided a convenient excuse for others to provoke and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:46">[15:46:46]</a>. This denial has continued for over 45 years, and Turkey has been unable to back down from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:50">[15:50:50]</a>.

### A Brief Period of Hope (2005-2012)

Between 2005 and 2011-2012, there was a brief period when hope emerged that Turkey might abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:09">[16:09:09]</a>. During this time, the genocide was openly discussed in Turkey for the first time, with many acknowledging the terrible nature of the events, regardless of terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:07">[17:07:07]</a>. Many individuals recognized the importance of confronting this history for Turkey's conscience and international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:44">[17:44:44]</a>.

The speaker expresses personal commitment to this issue until 2014-2015, advocating for Turkey to confront its past for the sake of its own societal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:01">[19:01:01]</a>. However, he now questions how long a society can carry the mourning of events that happened over a century ago, noting an "exaggeration of moral and mental balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:05">[20:05:05]</a>.

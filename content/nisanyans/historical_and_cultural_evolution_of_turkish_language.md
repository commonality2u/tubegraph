## Evolution of Military Terminology
The word "strategy" and its Turkish equivalents reflect a significant period of linguistic and military evolution in Turkey. The Ottoman term for strategy, "sevkülceyş" (meaning "dispatching an army"), was introduced into Turkish from Arabic, but its adoption as a modern military concept came later. It is believed that Arabs learned this term in Istanbul. The earliest written example of "sevkülceyş" found dates back to 1889, when German Ottoman General Kmer Von der Golds Pasha used it on his valuable and scientific map of Istanbul and its surroundings [00:12:19]. The term entered the Turkish language during a period of reform in the Ottoman military education system, influenced by the Germans [00:13:39].

The English word "strategy" itself first appeared in written records in 1810 [00:13:52], emerging during the Napoleonic Wars when military thought and doctrine were rapidly evolving [00:14:23]. Interestingly, no French examples of the word before the 1860s have been found, despite the expectation that such words would pass from French to English [00:14:26]. While the Ancient Greek term "strategos" (commander, army guiding) existed [00:14:52], "strategia" in ancient times referred to the commander's office or rank, not the modern concept of military science [00:15:15].

Alongside "sevkülceyş," another related term, "tabiye" (positioning), was coined in 1880 during the modernization of the Ottoman army and taught at the Military Academy [00:17:18]. "Tabiye" was a literal translation of "tactic" [00:17:51]. Both "sevkülceyş" and "tabiye" were extensively used in Turkish until the 1940s and 1950s, and were still present in the 1960s [00:18:06]. However, they were eventually replaced by the more direct translations "strategy" and "tactic" [00:18:23], leading to a perceived lack of "Öz Turkish" (pure Turkish) equivalents [00:18:27].

## Semantic Distinctions in Turkish
The speaker also addresses common confusions in word usage, exemplified by "mesel," "emsal," and "mesele." While "mesel" means "example" and "emsal" is its plural [01:19:20], "mesele" is a distinct word meaning "question" or "issue" [01:54:00]. Historically, "mesele" was an academic concept in madrasah education, referring to a subject open for discussion, with its Latin equivalent being "quaestio" [02:19:49]. Over time, its connection to its root meaning has been lost in modern usage [02:20:00].

## Influence of French on Turkish Vocabulary
The interaction between French and Turkish throughout history has significantly shaped the Turkish lexicon. It is estimated that approximately 4,800 words in the standard Turkish vocabulary (excluding specialized terms) are borrowed from French [02:32:28]. This accounts for a substantial portion of the approximately 15,000 words in the standard vocabulary [02:33:36].

Between 1810-1820 and the 1960s, a period of 150 years, French served as the primary reference language for Turks as Turkey adapted to the modern world [02:51:11]. After the 1960s, and especially after 1983, English largely replaced French as the main reference language [02:53:38].

Before the extensive influx of French words around 1810-1850, particularly before the Tanzimat reforms and the Crimean War [02:06:06], French words entering Turkish were primarily labels for foreign cultures [02:07:09]. These included terms like "general," "archduke," "duchess," "prince," "mademoiselle," "cardinal," and "senor" [02:37:36]. They were often used "in quotation marks" as they had no direct meaning or equivalent in Ottoman society [02:37:43].

Around 1810, a new wave of French words entered Turkish, representing concepts that could be adapted and imported into the local culture. These included:
*   **New cultural phenomena:** "Gazeta" (newspaper), first heard in İzmir around 1796-1798 and later in Istanbul [02:40:29]. "Müzisyen" (musician) around the same dates [02:49:14]. "Lotarya" (lottery) in 1820 [02:52:24].
*   **Material culture:** "Sofa" (new type of furniture with backrest) [02:52:29], "bilardo" (billiards) [02:54:42]. New clothing items like "palto" (coat) and "kravat" (tie) [02:59:51]. "Sigara" (cigarette) and "cigaret" (small cigar) in the 1840s [03:00:09].
*   **Social concepts:** "Bilet" (ticket), a new concept for public entertainment activities like theater or public transportation [03:22:25].
*   **Technical and scientific terms:** "Vapur" (steamship) from "bateau à vapeur" [03:18:18], "şifer" (railway) in the 1830s [03:28:29], "telgraf" (telegraph) in the 1820s-1830s [03:35:35]. "Elektrik" (electricity) dated to 1811 [03:59:59], "termometre" (thermometer) and "barometre" (barometer) [04:19:19]. "Kolera" (cholera), the disease name, entered in 1820 [04:26:26].
*   **Commercial products:** "Kotra" (type of boat) [04:42:42], new fabrics like "basma" (calico) and "flanel" (flannel) [04:54:58]. "Elmas" (diamond with a specific cut) [05:24:21].
*   **Institutional and political concepts:** "Banka" (bank) [05:38:38], "parlamento" (parliament) [05:54:33]. "Komutan" (commander) [05:46:46]. "Politika" (policy/politics), referring to interstate diplomacy in the 19th century, not domestic politics until the 20th century [05:06:06]. "Diktatör" (dictator) known since Napoleon's time [05:52:47]. "Polis" (police) and "jandarma" (gendarmerie) [06:00:04]. "Bütçe" (budget) [06:20:00].

These words filled gaps in the existing Ottoman vocabulary for new cultural, technical, and institutional phenomena that had no prior equivalents or were unknown to Ottoman society [07:34:00].

## Evolution of Dictionaries
The speaker discusses the Kube Altı dictionary as a frequently used and relatively good Turkish-Turkish dictionary, but criticizes its conservatism [07:56:00]. This conservatism stems from a generation's cultural prejudice, idealizing a "frozen Turkish" from the 1950s-1960s (the Democrat Party period), which saw a strong press and intense public discussions [08:20:00]. This period is seen as a calming phase after the "exorbitant" Language Revolution [08:52:00].

However, language is constantly evolving [09:27:00]. The speaker believes that print lexicography is outdated [09:09:00] and advocates for a modern dictionary infrastructure, similar to "Ekşi Dictionary" in its early crowdsourcing potential [09:26:00]. Such a dictionary would require:
1.  **Crowdsourcing:** Allowing many individuals to contribute, as a few writers cannot keep up with the rapid evolution of new words [09:42:00].
2.  **Bot network:** A technical infrastructure that instantly detects all Turkish words used across social and non-social media platforms [10:32:00]. The speaker defines "Turkish" broadly as any word understood by another speaker of Turkish in a conversation, regardless of its origin or correctness [11:06:00].
3.  **Strong editorial team:** To compile and filter the raw material collected by crowdsourcing and bots, ensuring consistency and adherence to principles [11:47:00]. This method is already used for modern dictionaries of languages like Japanese, French, and Estonian [11:50:00].

## The Jadidism Movement
The [[Jadidism movement|Jadidism movement]] was an innovation movement among the Muslims of Russia, primarily led by Tatars and Bashkirs, with participation from Azeris and Central Asians [13:41:00]. Emerging in the late 19th century, it sought to answer how these communities could adapt to the modern era in the face of striking Western developments [14:37:00]. Its main thought leader was Ismail Gasprinski [14:45:00].

The movement involved publishing magazines and newspapers, and launching education campaigns to integrate Turks and Muslims into the modern world within Russian society [14:59:00]. It accepted the Russian Empire in principle but aimed to reform how non-Christians could play a modern role within it [15:45:00]. The [[Jadidism movement|Jadidism movement]] led to active Turkish participation in the 1905 Russian Revolution [15:54:00]. After the revolution's failure, many Jadid leaders fled Russian oppression, going to Europe, Turkey, and Iran. They became a factor in the revolutionary movements in Iran (1907) and Turkey (1908), playing significant intellectual roles in Turkey from 1909-1910 onwards [16:09:00].

## Literacy and Language in Pre-Independence Balkans and Armenia
Before gaining independence, many Balkan nations under Ottoman rule, like Serbs, Bosnians, Bulgarians, and Macedonians, did not have widespread written languages [15:32:00]. The clergy, primarily Greek, were familiar with writing, often in Greek [15:56:00]. Slavic languages were written to a very limited extent in the 17th and 18th centuries [16:06:00]. While a Slavic written literature began to form before the Ottoman conquest (1300s-1400s), including a Serbian printing house [16:16:00], Slavic languages were generally not written from the 1500s to the 1700s [16:38:00]. The Slavic renaissance around 1820-1830 saw a sudden discovery that their languages could be written, leading to both religious and secular works and eventually, independence movements [16:45:00].

Croatians, not under Ottoman rule, wrote in Italian, German, Hungarian, and Latin, integrating into those cultures [17:13:00]. Bosnians, having converted to Islam, mostly wrote in Turkish with Ottoman script, and sometimes in Serbian with Ottoman script [17:08:07].

The idea of Albanian as a written language only emerged in the 1870s [17:32:00]. While some marginal Albanian texts existed from the 16th century, a written culture for Albanians did not develop until the late 19th century [17:39:00]. The Albanian alphabet was invented around 1878, possibly at the Prizren Conference, and later replaced by the Latin alphabet [17:49:00].

For Armenians, their own alphabet was invented in 405 AD by Mesrop Maşot from a village in Mus [18:55:05]. He not only created the alphabet but also led a team to translate the Bible and Greek Christian classics into Armenian, establishing a significant literary tradition [19:22:00]. Before 405 AD, Armenians did not have a written language [19:00:00]. The aristocracy primarily used Persian, while royal decrees and official meetings were conducted in a form of Parthian or a dialect of Persian [19:07:00]. An enormous number of Persian words entered Armenian between the 1st and 5th centuries AD [19:42:00]. The religious institution, distinct from the military and state, leaned more towards Greek culture, using Syriac in southern provinces and Greek as the language of higher education [19:54:00]. Therefore, the classics translated into Armenian after 405 were primarily from Greek, not Syriac [20:34:00]. Most of the "Saint Translators" (12-person team led by Mesrop Maşot) had strong Greek cultural backgrounds, many having studied in Istanbul, a cultural center [20:40:00]. Literacy in Armenian society before this period was confined to a very small minority [20:56:00].

## The Speaker's English Language Learning Experience
The speaker learned English primarily through self-study during a summer before high school, starting with simplified novels and actively building vocabulary [20:49:00]. He gained admission to Robert College without needing a preparatory year [21:10:00]. Later, during university, he focused on mastering written English, staying up all night to refine his skills [21:19:00]. Living with an American spouse for 6-7 years further improved his spoken English and accent [21:23:00]. Upon returning to Turkey, he spent many years writing professionally in English, primarily tourism books [21:55:00]. He considers his written English capacity more developed than his Turkish, attributing it to experience and habit [22:35:00]. However, his spoken English has become rusty due to infrequent use, noting that English, like Turkish, evolves rapidly with new concepts and expressions [22:48:00].

The speaker begins by acknowledging the lingering trauma of the earthquake in Türkiye, noting how people have reverted to familiar discussions that have persisted for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Post-Earthquake Political Commentary
The speaker addresses common critiques regarding their evolving stance on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. They state that their views are consistent with what they have expressed over the past 3-5 years, identifying four core themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>:
1.  **Erdoğan's Political Acumen**: The speaker consistently maintains that Erdoğan is a "political genius" who often acts contrary to common expectations in crises, yet consistently consolidates his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. They cite the events of 2013, particularly the 7-17 December incidents, as a "masterpiece of political science," albeit an immoral one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The speaker suggests that the "expert, educated, intellectual, civilized" elite in Türkiye are incapable of perceiving this reality due to political or class hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Credible Alternative**: Erdoğan's 21 years in power are not due to the "stupidity of the Turkish people" but rather the absence of a credible alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The opposition is described as a "scarecrow" lacking vision, excitement, or hope, and prone to "playing a double game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The opposition's partner is seen as representing the "darkest and most rotten elements of 1990s Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
3.  **Sound Foreign Policy**: The speaker believes Türkiye's foreign policy, whether determined by Erdoğan or a state consensus, is largely correct. Despite "ridiculous mistakes," they argue it is the best possible approach in a rapidly shifting global landscape, especially given the "sinking" Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Maintaining Türkiye's "relative independence and distance" should be the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
4.  **Erdoğan's Character**: The speaker expresses a strong and increasing "antipathy" towards Erdoğan since his time as Mayor of Istanbul, intensified by the recent earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They describe his discourse as solely focused on "hatred and threats," comparing it to Adolf Hitler's tactic of instilling hatred against a chosen target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This "hate feast" is seen as making people sick and driving them to despair, hindering constructive thought and solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

The speaker sees no contradiction in these four views, asserting that "the real world is like this now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Before the earthquake, their voting tendency was split 50-50, leaning slightly towards Erdoğan, but after the earthquake, it shifted, leading to a "needle turned the other way," favoring Kılıçdaroğlu 51 to 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. However, seeing the opposition's response to the earthquake, repeating "old clichés and empty words," has again shaken their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Role of Religious Affairs Directorate
The speaker criticizes the Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), particularly concerning a "ridiculous" fatwa about sexual intercourse with adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. They clarify that fatwas are answers to questions, implying that the public insistently asks about such "kink jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. They argue that the Diyanet must answer according to 1400 years of Islamic Law, not personal opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. The speaker suggests that the topics of primary concern for most people are "kink jobs," livelihood, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. Islamic law's answers to these questions are deemed "stale," lacking the ability to improve itself for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. The speaker challenges the "enlightened and educated" segment to offer moral leadership and guidance on these fundamental human issues, rather than just criticizing religious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. The Turkish educated class is accused of class hatred, seeing a large portion of society as "cleaners" who are "dirty in essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

## Societal and Political Transformations Post-Earthquake
The speaker foresees significant consequences of the [[trkiye_and_syria_earthquake_impact | Trkiye and Syria earthquake impact]]:
*   **Internal Migration**: A large-scale [[migration_and_demographic_changes_postdisaster | internal migration]] of 5 to 10 million people is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. If the country cannot handle this, it will turn into external migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Economic Strain**: The state budget has been "seriously shaken," posing a "huge question mark" for Türkiye's ability to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
*   **Security Concerns**: The speaker draws a parallel to the 1993 displacement of 1 million Kurds, noting that Türkiye has not yet overcome those social shocks, and the current event is larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Election Postponement**: The speaker believes the election has been "shelved" and predicts its postponement, asserting that if it happens once unconstitutionally, it can happen again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **School Closures**: The decision to close schools is viewed as a "very serious pregnancy" and a move to "go into war mode," suggesting concerns about "political coup, internal coup, regime coup, a turmoil in universities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

## Science, Reason, and Propaganda
The speaker discusses the historical shift in the perception of science:
*   **Shift in Scientific Authority**: The traditional view that science and reason are infallible guides, prevalent from the 1700s to the late 1900s, is no longer possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Institute of Advanced Research**: A turning point was the establishment of the Institute of Advanced Research by the US in the final months of WWII, where scientists were gathered to serve state interests (armament, atomic bomb, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. This marked science's transformation into a tool for the state, with principles compromised and dissent suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Science as Propaganda**: Since the late 20th century, science has "completely turned into a part of a state propaganda, a servant of the state's power game," blurring the lines between science and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Scientific research has become extraordinarily expensive, leading to institutions investing capital having rights over results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Information**: The speaker suggests that "Trust in science" is no different from trusting priests or teachers in earlier ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. People are "groping in the dark" for truth, swayed by conspiracy theories or despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Reason and criticism remain crucial tools for questioning dogmas and identifying contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that a reliable guide for the mind is no longer science, citing examples like global warming and health fashions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Identifying Propaganda**: To distinguish propaganda from real information, one must use reason and logic, question consistency, and understand the "mindset, mentality, goals, and concerns" of the players in dominant media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Global Power Dynamics and International Relations
The speaker critiques a journalist's suggestion for earthquake aid, which proposed matching each of Türkiye's 10 affected provinces with a "friendly country" (e.g., USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, UK, France, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. This list is seen as ignorant for excluding major global players in infrastructure development:
*   **China**: China is consistently seen as the force behind large infrastructure projects worldwide, offering "generous loans" in places like Georgia and Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.
*   **Arab Capital**: Large-scale administrative and real estate speculation projects are linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, or the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Russia**: More modest projects are linked to Russian oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Western Decline**: Europeans have been "bankrupt since 2008," offering little to other countries beyond chain markets and stingy, short-term profit-driven investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. The US "only sells weapons," providing no other benefit to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. The speaker expresses anger at the limited perspective of the "smart" people who ignore these global realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### Ukraine War Analysis
The speaker analyzes the [[historical_and_political_transformation_in_global_power_dynamics | Ukraine War]], stating it is "not about Ukraine" but "about Germany" and preventing a natural partnership between Germany and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Russia's Position**: Russia is seen as a natural partner for Western Europe, particularly Germany, offering natural resources and energy in exchange for high-tech products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.
*   **US Motivation**: The US perceived this potential "marriage" between Germany and Russia as the "biggest threat to its world domination" and actively sabotaged it, leading to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.
*   **War Outcome**: After a year, the speaker claims the Ukrainian army and infrastructure are "destroyed," with significant casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>. Russia's goals of "denazification and demilitarization" appear to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. The US goal to "disintegrate Russia and change its regime and destroy its economy" has failed; the Russian economy has performed better than Western European countries, and its diplomatic position has strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
*   **Future Strategy**: Russia should not completely defeat NATO, as a cornered opponent might strike elsewhere. Instead, Russia should allow an "escape route" for the Ukrainians to overthrow their current regime, offering a potential partnership with Poland over Western Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

## Historical Borders and Agreements
The speaker discusses the drawing of the Turkey-Syria border:
*   **Syria Border**: The Syrian border was primarily drawn through negotiations between England, France, and the Ottoman Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. It was surprisingly easily determined after the Armistice of Mondros in October 1918, which later became the basis for Turkey's National Pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.
*   **Border Features**: The border largely follows the Baghdad railway line, with the railway remaining on the Turkish side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. It also closely follows the Arab-Turkish ethnic border, especially around Kilis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. However, due to the railway, a significant Arab population remained on the Turkish side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.
*   **Iraq Border**: The speaker is less certain about the Iraqi border, noting it has no "natural" or "logical" features like a railway and seemed "drawn randomly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. The border was not stabilized until 1926-27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Other Topics
*   **Movie Recommendations**: The speaker recommends two recent movies: a "very dark movie" in the language of northwestern Spain's mountain villages (unnamed but upsetting to many, loved by the speaker) and "Mandarins," a Georgian-Estonian-Georgian co-production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Mandarins is described as well-acted, humorous, deep, serious, and having a moral lesson, unlike the first film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **[[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | Genocide]] Concept**: The concept of [[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | genocide]] was developed by Rafael Lemkin in the 1940s, addressing the paradox that killing one person is punished, but killing millions (like Hitler) was not initially defined as a crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. The speaker suggests that punishing a crime is about maintaining social order, and killing millions might not disrupt it, or could even reinforce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Speaker's Craftsmanship**: Beyond intellectual pursuits, the speaker identifies expertise in etymology (examining words, source names, place names) and construction. They designed and oversaw the construction of over 40 residences and public buildings in Şirince, working hands-on as a foreman for nearly 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Artificial Earthquakes**: The speaker dismisses the idea of artificial earthquakes by the US and Israel as a conspiracy theory, comparing it to believing in angels participating in battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. They also note that the earthquake in Türkiye did not significantly distract European attention from the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **Travel Recommendations**: For a spring holiday without visa issues, the speaker suggests Georgia, especially Tbilisi, calling it a "unique city" and "very beautiful country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. Armenia is also mentioned as a "very beautiful country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Egypt is recommended for winter travel (December-February) due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. North Macedonia and its capital Skopje are also suggested as nice and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Artvin Province**: The speaker describes Artvin as one of Türkiye's most beautiful provinces, known for its 30-35 disconnected plateaus, with a "dramatic and striking" central Coruh river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>. They compare exploring its plateaus to island-hopping in Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. The people of Artvin are described as civilized and not prone to fear and hatred like those in Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
*   **Memoir Writing**: The speaker advises novices against writing memoirs, stating it requires "great mastery" to transform meaningless events into a meaningful story, and that 99% of attempts would be "garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

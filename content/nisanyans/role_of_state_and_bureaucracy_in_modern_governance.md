The balance between the state and society has undergone a radical transformation over the last 200 years, particularly with the advent of [[modernization_and_the_transition_from_divine_to_humanmade_laws | modernization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This shift has led to an extraordinary level of state penetration into every area of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.

## Historical Context of State Administration

### Pre-Modern State Structure
In the old era, both in the Ottoman Empire and in Europe, the central state, despite being a kingdom, had a very limited number of personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. Its administrative cadres were ridiculously small and operated on a very low budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Local administrations were typically under the sovereignty of feudal lords like beys, counts, dukes, or aghas, who ruled over regions of 10 to 50 villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. These lords maintained control with a small number of soldiers and had a feudal relationship with local notables, primarily collecting tribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. The central administration's salaried personnel were extremely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

### Evolution of Bureaucracy (19th-20th Century)
The establishment of a professional bureaucracy began in the 1830s in the Ottoman Empire, approximately 100 years before the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. This involved creating a new class of civil administration cadres, often referred to as 'clerkship' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. To train these new administrators, the state established various schools, including middle schools, idadis, and sultanates, leading to institutions like the MÃ¼lkiye school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

Over 200 years, the numbers of state personnel increased by a hundredfold, leading to the establishment of a massive administrative organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. Alongside this expansion, a dedicated Police Organization was created to protect and oversee this administrative body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

## Role of the State in the Economy

Historically, the primary duty of the state was not to manage the economy, but to collect taxes and tributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. The basic logic of the state is likened to a mafia, collecting tribute in exchange for providing public and security services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

### Mercantilism and Investment
In the 17th and 18th centuries, European states began to explore economic activities beyond simple tax collection, influenced by the Mercantilist thought movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. This involved supporting citizens who plundered resources from other places (colonies), with the state receiving a share of the trade income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>. States gradually recognized that investing to increase tax revenues was a logical strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

### State-led Industrialization
The 19th century saw states planning and encouraging industrial investments, such as building roads and railways or establishing schools, to provide infrastructure that would enable civilians and capitalists to invest, earn money, and ultimately pay more taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. The 20th century marked a significant shift, with the state itself beginning to invest directly in industrial and commercial ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

## Critiques of Modern Bureaucracy and State Power

The speaker observes that the modern state has "spread like a cancer" and "destroyed societies" by taking over various aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

There is a concern that [[bureaucratic_inefficiencies_in_western_countries | irrationalism is in the hands of the administration in Western countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Centralized Control and Loss of Freedom
A key factor contributing to the decline of Western civilization and culture is the rise of centralized states and their expansion into colonial territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. The entire Western geography is now governed from a central point, leading to a loss of individual freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

Although a discourse of freedom existed after 1945, partly due to old habits and a perceived independence of European countries, this luxury has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. By the early 21st century, the power of military and intelligence institutions has grown so immense that they have effectively controlled countries, especially those considered "colonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

One of the most significant moves in the 2000s was the elimination of the autonomy of national banking systems, with even Switzerland eventually submitting to police control over all bank movements by American institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. The hope that the internet would create an area of freedom in the 21st century has also proven to be illusory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that to break this central control mechanism, a global revolution, potentially involving war, is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This cannot be achieved through demonstrations or traditional political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.

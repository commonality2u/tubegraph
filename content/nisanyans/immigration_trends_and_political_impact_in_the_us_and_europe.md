The year 2023 marks a significant global turning point in economic, demographic, and military terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. Understanding these shifts, particularly in [[global_immigration_trends_and_their_impact | global immigration trends]], is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## United States

For the first time in the country's history, the number of people born in America remained lower than the number of people immigrating to the United States in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. A new population is entering the country, with almost all new arrivals coming illegally by easily crossing the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This represents a transformation rarely observed in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

Despite this, the political system of the United States does not currently allow for such a transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. However, social tensions and stress have reached "unbearable points," making an "explosion" seem inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Europe

A situation similar to the [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | United States]] is occurring in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, with a "flood of people" from poorer countries entering European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The political consequences of this [[mass_migration_and_its_societal_impact | mass migration]] are expected to be clear and rapidly developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

It appears inevitable that so-called "extreme right" parties, which are essentially anti-immigrant and prioritize defending indigenous culture, will come to power in various European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. These parties and movements are also generally against the European Union project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. While the European Union is not expected to disappear or see withdrawals, its past twenty years of increasing sovereignty over member countries will likely become unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Expansion projects of the European Union are also deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

Contrary to the notion that the Turkish populace is "uncouth and peasants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, the majority of people in Turkey are not peasants, with the peasant population having fallen below 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. On the contrary, when compared to world standards, Turkish people are generally "quite well-mannered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While the "nouveau riche class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> and those in newly urbanized areas adapting to city culture may exhibit "serious problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the fundamental issue facing Turkey is not a lack of innate civility or an abundance of peasantry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Problem: An Under-Educated Elite

The core issue in Turkey is the poor education of its "educated classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The "real fault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> lies in the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_turkish_elites | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, which is tasked with guiding the country and setting ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The biggest failure of the Republic of Turkey's [[challenges_in_turkish_education_system | education system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> has been its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

While the Republic succeeded in providing basic education to large masses, particularly after 1950, by opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a healthy society requires more than just minimum-level education for everyone or a sufficient number of civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is crucial to cultivate an "elite group that will lead that society and form the intellectual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Historically, the few opportunities for elite education in Turkey came from institutions established during the Ottoman period, many of which were founded by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The Republic, however, "did not allow them to develop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, instead causing them to shrink in size and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Consequently, the number and quality of "seriously educated, world-class educated people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> in Turkey have steadily declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Today, such an education is only attainable by a "very small happy minority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> fortunate enough to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The domestic education system is largely a "stupid brainwashing program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> that primarily teaches obedience and how to be a civil servant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This system has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## The Public's Thirst for Knowledge

Despite the shortcomings of the elite and the education system, the Turkish populace, particularly the Anatolian people, demonstrate a profound "search of a wise and cultured person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Their "love for scholars and their respect for scholars is endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This respect is evident across diverse settings, from village environments to prisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. People listen intently to what a "teacher" says and "attach great importance to knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

There is a tremendous "thirst for knowledge on some basic issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, especially religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The public is open to all ideas, even radical ones like atheism, if they are explained "seriously and lovingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. They display great curiosity about "problems related to the universe and existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> and historical or social topics such as the history of Turkey, the Armenian Genocide, the Kurdish issue, the Syrian issue, or whether Atatürk was a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They "listen to it with enthusiasm as if they found an oasis in the desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Ultimately, there is a "great hunger for knowledge in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## The Failure of Guidance

This innate thirst for knowledge is not being adequately satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The "westernized and very few in number and very limited in quality" elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> cannot provide this essential service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. When the secular elite fails, people turn to religious figures like teachers and pilgrims (Hacı Hacı) for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. However, the [[role_of_elites_and_religious_education_in_turkey | elite religious education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> has also been suppressed, leading to a significant decline in the quality of Islamic religious experts compared to the end of the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This decline is a "result of an education system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The "half-educated Turks," those who perceive themselves as the "white Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, are criticized for their "ignorance and moral degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. They lack "social responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> and the instinct to teach or give to others, exhibiting a selfish mindset of "always me, let me take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This segment of Turkish society, estimated at 1 to 2 million people, is considered a "scourge of Türkiye morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is attributed to their poor education, as there is "no education system in Türkiye that will make it a mission to guide people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

Furthermore, the "real elites," a staff of about 50,000 people, are "terribly alien to this society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Their primary ambition is to "leave Türkiye as soon as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, and if they cannot go themselves, they try to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This situation represents a "great tragedy for a country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, where a populace hungry for knowledge lacks the intellectual guidance it desperately seeks.

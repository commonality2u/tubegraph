Henry Kissinger, a prominent figure in American foreign policy, passed away at over 100 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Even shortly before his death, he undertook serious diplomatic missions, such as a trip to China for important meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Contrasting Perspectives

Kissinger is often described as "the devil himself" by critics of American imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. However, there's a nuanced view, particularly from figures like Vladimir Putin and Chinese executive officers, who expressed respect for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. They lament that the United States and Western countries no longer produce men of his caliber, viewing him as a respected enemy because of his intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## A Symbol of an Era

Kissinger's life story is seen as intimately connected with the rise and peak of the American Empire, often referred to as [[perspectives_on_western_alliances_and_propaganda | Pax Americana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This American world order was established during his youth, reached its zenith during his career, and was on its decline at the time of his death, making him an embodiment of that period and system of sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Shaping American World Order

The American world order did not emerge spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Starting from 1940-1942, before America even entered [[nns_stance_during_world_war_ii | World War II]], the U.S. systematically and consciously worked to establish its global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. They built their economic, institutional, political, and military alliances quite consciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. After the catastrophic period of 1918-1938, the U.S. decided to establish a world order under its control—economically, militarily, and intellectually—to avoid past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### Importing Talent

To staff this burgeoning empire, Americans, lacking sufficient cadres, "imported" talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This influx included qualified individuals from Germany, Eastern Europe, France, and England, who were integrated into effective and authoritative positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Kissinger, born in Germany and living there until age 18, was one such example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Others included his "disciple and successor" Zbigniew Brzezinski from Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, and Madeleine Albright, another Secretary of State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. These individuals often came to America seeking liberation from war, tyranny, and concentration camps, and thus served the American Empire with great loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

The U.S. brought talented people into the system primarily through three avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>:
1.  **Military Service:** Talented soldiers from World War II were transferred into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Kissinger was one of these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
2.  **Intelligence Organizations:** Individuals trained within intelligence organizations were selected and promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Kissinger was also among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
3.  **Elite Academia:** Graduates from top universities like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia were employed as academic researchers and idea producers before being promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Evolving Ideals

In the 1940s, a cadre of administrators from America's old Protestant elite, primarily from Northeastern states, still played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This "American aristocracy" had strong Protestant religious feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> and determined a moral discourse, even if hypocritical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

However, the modern generation of imported people, unlike their predecessors, did not come unconditionally seeking liberation but primarily to earn money and build careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This shift indicates a "difference in quality" in the perspective of those leading the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## Kissinger's Intellectual Foundations for Foreign Policy

Kissinger's doctoral thesis focused on Metternich and Castlereagh, British and German diplomats from the early 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This work showcased an admiration for European interstate balance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### The Concept of Legitimacy Consensus

A core idea from this historical study, influencing American foreign policy theorists, is that the basic goal in international relations is to achieve a "legitimacy consensus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   A stable international system requires an order that the world's great powers find acceptable and reasonable within common principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   Conversely, a situation where one or more powerful states find the existing order unacceptable leads to instability and war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   The European order of the 1920s was unstable because major players like Germany and the Soviet Union viewed it as illegitimate and lacked a common value system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
*   In contrast, the 19th-century European system was stable for almost 100 years without major state conflicts, because the key powers, despite conflicts, reached a consensus on legitimate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

The establishment of such a consensus is considered the fundamental condition for an empire and world order, and U.S. policies were based on this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

### Current State of the World Order

Today, this perspective and the idea of a common value system are seen as bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The ongoing war in Palestine and Gaza is cited as a "last straw," leading major states to conclude that the existing situation and balance of powers are unacceptable and illegitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. This marks the culmination of a process of collapse and disintegration that began with events like the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Foreign-Born Individuals in American Foreign Policy

Kissinger's career highlights that individuals of foreign origin, while unable to become U.S. president or climb to the highest domestic political positions, can become managers of the American Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. To do so, they must adopt an American identity, think like an American, and prioritize American state interests as their sole goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

This phenomenon is evident in figures like Henry Barkey, an influential manager of U.S. Middle East policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, and Zalmay Khalilzad, a key figure in America's Afghanistan war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. However, a potential pitfall is allowing personal history or prejudices, such as anti-Russian sentiment from a Polish background, to influence state administration, a point of contention even in academic discussions with figures like Brzezinski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. This highlights the importance of maintaining focus on American state interests above personal biases.

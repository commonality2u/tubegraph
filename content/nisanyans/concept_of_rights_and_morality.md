The concept of rights and morality is explored as a fundamental human instinct and a subject of continuous societal and [[philosophical_discussions_on_morality_and_belief | philosophical discussion]].

## The Innate Sense of Right
The "Concept of Right" is presented as a basic human instinct that guides daily actions and decisions, from choosing what to wear to how to interact with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This instinct is described as a "biological category" or something inherent in human "settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

The most basic dimension of conscience is tied to this sense of right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. While the "calculus of right" can vary among individuals, the fundamental sense of this emotion is universal in mentally healthy people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Human-Specific Concept
The concept of rights is considered specific to humans, as animals do not possess the capacity to weigh their actions against the rights of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. An animal does not, for example, consider whether it has the right to eat in a certain place or yield to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Intersubjective Nature of Rights
The concept of rights is fundamentally intersubjective, meaning it is based on the assumption that others are also subjects with inner selves, feelings, and inherent rights, just like oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. When interacting with others, such as hiring, accepting, or even stealing from them, there is an implicit calculation that acknowledges the other person's humanity and rights, even if one's own rights are perceived as stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Therefore, the concept of rights always precedes a relationship with another rights-bearing subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Animal Welfare
The speaker views the concept of "animal rights" as problematic, dangerous, and harmful, as it risks diminishing human rights and moral behaviors by equating them to animal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. While it may be a duty to treat animals well, this is seen as a duty towards other people, reflecting the value of being a good and compassionate person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. There cannot be a relationship of mutual rights between humans and animals because animals do not recognize human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Morality vs. Legality
Regarding the Armenian genocide, the speaker states that denying the genocide is not a crime, but rather an act of [[religious_belief_and_rationality | immorality or ignorance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. This distinction highlights that morality and legality are separate concepts, with immorality being "very bad things" even if not criminalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Societal Morality and Conscience
The speaker discusses Turkey's historical denial of the Armenian genocide, initially a policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, which later shifted to outright denial in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. This policy was seen as a "stupid" and "shameless" approach that damaged Turkey's international standing and created an "excuse" for others to provoke Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

There was a period between 2005 and 2012 when a "window of hope" opened for Turkey to confront its past and abandon this "conscientious hump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. Many sensible individuals, even in mainstream media, began to advocate for acknowledging the terrible events, if not necessarily calling it genocide, for the sake of humanity and Turkey's own conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. However, this courage was not shown at an official level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

The speaker personally struggled for Turkey to confront this issue, viewing it as essential for the country to overcome its societal "diseases" and become a healthier society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. This reflects a belief that societal well-being is linked to addressing historical moral failings.

## The Role of Discussion in Moral Inquiry
The speaker advocates for the "discussion method" as the only realistic and satisfactory way to choose between different ideas, especially in complex historical or moral issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Examining the evidence for a view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   Assessing the reliability of those who propose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Understanding the underlying motivations or "prayer beads" of different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
This process, referred to as "dialectic" in the classical sense, encourages comparing and discussing views to determine which prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

An understanding of diverse ideas, movements, and discussions leads to the realization that one's own prejudices and unexamined feelings are not necessarily the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This awareness can initially lead to a sense of hopelessness, but ultimately helps in navigating a polyphonic world where different perspectives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

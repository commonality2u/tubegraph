The topic of Albanian migration to Türkiye and their subsequent influence can be understood through several historical periods and types of migration, as well as their integration into society.

## Early Ottoman Period: Albanian Bey Class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>
During the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian Bey class served as loyal servants and allies of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. They frequently occupied powerful positions within the Ottoman state hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a> and undertook critical tasks in governing non-Muslim populations in the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Albanians played various roles as Ottoman representatives, loyal men, and a Muslim striking force in the region from southern Greece to Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Consequently, many individuals of Albanian origin were present in the Ottoman ruling, military, ulema, and cultured classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Mass Migration Post-Balkan Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>
Mass migration of ordinary Albanians to Türkiye largely occurred after the Balkan Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. These migrants typically did not come from the country currently known as Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. A significant portion of Muslim Albanians from Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro, especially from Kosovo, preferred to migrate to Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>. They found it inconvenient to live under Christian rule, leading to their relocation for both just and unjust reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Most Albanians in Türkiye today are either Macedonian or Kosovar in origin, with some also coming from the Yenipazar Sanjak or Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Later Migrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>
After 1912, very few people migrated to Türkiye directly from Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. However, in recent years (post-1990s and 2000s), a small number of Albanians immigrated to Türkiye due to Albania's independence and subsequent economic and political crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

## Types of Albanian Communities in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>
There are three main types of Albanian communities in Türkiye:
1.  **Old Ottoman Albanians** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>: These are descendants of the Albanian Bey class and other Albanians who settled in the Ottoman Empire prior to the Balkan Wars.
2.  **Post-1912 Migrants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>: Albanians who migrated from Yugoslavia and Greece between 1912 and the 1950s/1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
3.  **Recent Migrants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>: A smaller number of people who arrived from Albania after the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.

### Naming Conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>
A distinguishing feature among these groups is their naming conventions:
*   The first and second groups of Albanians typically carry classical Muslim names like Ahmet, Mehmet, Ragıp, Süleyman, and Fatma, as they are all Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.
*   In Albania, since the time of Enver Hoxha (1940s onwards), Muslim names were not encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Instead, neutral, non-religious, secular Albanian names were preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. Thus, the names of those who came to Türkiye from Albania in the last 20-30 years are distinct Albanian names unfamiliar in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. This highlights a subtle [[impact_of_albanias_religious_and_cultural_history | impact of Albania's religious and cultural history]] on personal identity.

The broader context of migration in Türkiye, including the [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration and settlement patterns in Eastern Anatolia]] for Kurdish populations, offers parallels in how various groups have integrated or assimilated over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

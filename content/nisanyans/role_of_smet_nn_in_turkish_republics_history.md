İsmet İnönü, a prominent figure in the [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkish Republic's history]], is the subject of an article written in 2018 discussing his complex legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. He is characterized as a manager without a grand vision, not driven by megalomania or ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Relationship with Atatürk and Ascendancy to Power

İnönü and [[mustafa_kemals_policies_and_legacy | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] were close allies for 17 of Atatürk's 19 years in power, managing the country together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. İnönü deeply admired Atatürk's intelligence and dominant personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. However, he was reportedly disturbed by Atatürk's alcoholism, debauchery, and governance style, particularly decisions made during drunken nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. He often had to clarify decisions the morning after by asking Atatürk, who would tell him, "İsmet, do as you wish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

In 1937, İnönü was removed from the Prime Ministry and left politics, becoming effectively erased from public life due to Atatürk's displeasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. His name became dangerous to mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. Despite this, he was unanimously elected president the day after Atatürk's death, a move whose orchestration remains largely unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

## Policies and Legacy

### World War II Neutrality and Economic Policies
İnönü is largely credited with keeping Turkey out of the disaster of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This decision prevented the country from suffering the immense losses experienced by other nations like Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Turkey's army was in a "miserable desert" state in 1940, making entry into the war a risky endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

Economically, İnönü pursued cautious and restrained policies, understanding the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. After 1946, with the opening of credit lines from the United States, he approved rapid economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Social and Cultural Reforms
İnönü sincerely appreciated Western culture and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He developed a love for classical music during his military service in Yemen, a passion he later encouraged in Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

He did not show interest in flashy symbolic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Instead, he championed practical "revolutions" like the planting of tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur, and the eradication of diseases like malaria, which provided lasting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

He actively supported the establishment of [[role_of_educated_classes_in_turkey | Village Institutes]], which aimed to bring educated cadres to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Land reform projects were also initiated during his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Controversies and Criticisms
#### Dersim Rebellion
İnönü played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, he took a more moderate stance during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion, which led to his dismissal and "political death" for contradicting Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The Dersim operation, which involved mass killings and the displacement of families, was personally commanded by Atatürk, with İnönü's successor, Celal Bayar, executing the plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

#### Turkism and Nationalism
After 1930, İnönü kept his distance from Turkism movements that had spread under Atatürk's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He had an old enmity with figures from the Turkish Hearths school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. His actions in 1942, breaking pro-Nazi structures with arrests, turned this enmity into a "blood feud" with Turkists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. After 1942, Turkism became a main cleavage line in [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

#### Wartime Hardships and Non-Muslims
The wartime years saw hardships for the population, including bread rationing and forced labor, which tarnished İnönü's name for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. However, these sufferings were considered minor compared to those in war-torn European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The treatment of non-Muslims, particularly the Wealth Tax (Varlık Vergisi) in 1942, was a major point of controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The speaker views this as a targeted act of plunder, akin to Union and Progress regime's policies during WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. During this period, a significant portion of the non-Muslim male population was sent to concentration camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Post-1950 Democratic Era
İnönü's career after 1950 saw him become the first and possibly only National Chief to leave power following an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

He played a crucial role in moderating the 1960 military coup, preventing the country from moving towards a radical Nasserist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. He sided with the more institutional faction of the army that aimed for a temporary cleanup and return to a multi-party system compatible with the NATO alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

However, his later career is criticized, particularly his political fights with Süleyman Demirel and his support for military sentences in 1971, as well as his struggle to retain power from Bülent Ecevit at an old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. These actions are seen as damaging his own reputation and contributing to the "fossilization" and deadlock in [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

### İnönü and the Atatürk Cult
After Atatürk's death in 1938, İnönü took steps to gradually reduce the cult of personality, removing Atatürk's picture from money and allowing previously exiled figures like Kazım Karabekir and Halide Edip to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. This period, until 1950, saw a move away from the "founder God cult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. Atatürk's body was even kept in the basement of the Ethnography Museum for 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>, reflecting a policy to distance Turkey from Soviet-style leader worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

However, in 1950, under the new Democrat Party government, the cult of Atatürk was resurrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This was seen as a deliberate political decision to unite the country during a risky transition to a multi-party system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. The "Atatürk Protection Law" was enacted, Anıtkabir (Atatürk's mausoleum) was revived, and Atatürk busts were placed in public offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. This cult, however, intensified and became a "national religion" after the 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

## İnönü's Character and Enduring Relevance
İnönü is described as a politician who paid attention to delicate balances in human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. His cautious personality was evident across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The speaker highlights that while İnönü admired Atatürk, their styles and approaches were very different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

Despite the complexities of his legacy, İnönü's role in guiding Turkey through critical periods, particularly World War II and the initial democratic transition, remains a central part of [[modernization_and_secularism_in_turkish_history | Turkish history]].

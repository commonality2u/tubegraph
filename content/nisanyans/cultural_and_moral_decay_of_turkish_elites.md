From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The core issue facing [[Social and cultural dynamics in Trkiye | Türkiye]], according to one perspective, is not primarily the "uncouthness" or "peasantry" of its general population, but rather the [[Role of elites and religious education in Turkey | moral and cultural decay of its elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This elite, traditionally tasked with guiding the country, presenting ideals, and serving as an example, is seen as failing in its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Misconceptions about the Turkish Populace

Contrary to some claims, the majority of the Turkish population today are not peasants; the peasant population has fallen below 1.20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Furthermore, Turkish people are generally considered well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While there are adaptation challenges in newly urbanized areas where people transition from village to city culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the speaker asserts that the true "uncouth" segment is the "nouveau riche" middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Educational Failures and Elite Formation

The fundamental problem identified is the poor education of the educated classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The Republic of Turkey's greatest failure in education has been its inability to establish a proper system for educating elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

While there was success in extending basic primary education to large masses, especially after 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a society requires more than just minimum-level education for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It necessitates an elite group to lead and shape the intellectual landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Decline of Elite Education Institutions

Historically, the few opportunities for elite education in [[Historical context and analysis of Turkish literature and culture | Türkiye]] were institutions established during the [[Cultural and educational aspects of the Ottoman ruling class | Ottoman period]], often by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The Republic did not allow these schools to grow; instead, their numbers and budgets shrank, confining them to a limited scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Consequently, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in [[Cultural and historical analysis of Turkish identity | Turkey]] have steadily decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Achieving this level of education is now largely limited to a small, fortunate minority who can study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Problems with Domestic and Foreign Education

The speaker argues that a high-quality education system is not organically integrated within [[Modernization efforts in Turkish history | Turkey]], forcing individuals to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, those educated abroad often struggle to adapt to local conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, hindering their ability to assume leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Domestically, the education system is criticized as a "stupid brainwashing program" designed to produce civil servants who are subservient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Consequences of Elite Failure

The Republic has failed to cultivate a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, leading to the elites gradually becoming "ignorant of that role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### The Public's Thirst for Guidance

Despite the elite's shortcomings, the public, particularly the Anatolian people, demonstrate a profound search for wise and cultured individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Their love and respect for scholars are described as "endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This respect is observed even for individuals whose ideas may contradict common values, in diverse settings from villages to prisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. There is a deep-seated value for knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

When the "westernized" and quantitatively and qualitatively limited elite fail to provide intellectual guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, the public turns to religious figures like teachers and pilgrims (`Hacı Hacı`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. However, [[Role of elites and religious education in Turkey | elite religious education]] has also been hindered, leading to a significant decline in the quality of Islamic religious experts compared to the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This decline is attributed to the flawed education system, not the individuals themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

There is a "tremendous [[Public thirst for knowledge and intellectual guidance in Turkey | thirst for knowledge]]" among the people, especially regarding religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. They listen with great curiosity and hunger to discussions on topics like the universe, existence, [[Historical context of 1930s Turkey and social implications | Turkish history]], [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | social structure]], and contentious issues like the Armenian Genocide or the Kurdish issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The public's enthusiasm for knowledge is akin to finding an oasis in a desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### The Detached and Self-Serving "Half-Educated"

A particular concern is the "ignorance and moral degradation" of "half-educated Turks" – those who consider themselves "white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This group, estimated to be around 1 to 2 million people, is described as the "scourge of Türkiye" morally and culturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. They are characterized by a lack of social responsibility, an absence of an instinct to teach or give to others, and a self-centered mindset of "always me, let me take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This behavior is again attributed to their upbringing and the lack of an education system that fosters a mission to guide people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Above this group, the "real elites," a staff of approximately 50,000 people, are also terribly alienated from society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Their primary aspiration is to leave [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Türkiye]] as soon as possible, and failing that, to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This trend represents a profound tragedy for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Recent geopolitical shifts, particularly concerning [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]], have marked a significant turning point in 21st-century history, reshaping the influence and roles of key regional powers like Russia, Iran, and [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This represents a major victory for one side and a defeat for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Russia's Diminished Global Influence

Russia has suffered a significant defeat in recent developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There is a strong belief that the outcome in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] was a result of a compromise agreement between Russia and the United States, involving [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Türkiye, Iran, and Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Russia, along with [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Türkiye and Iran]], may have received concessions for not fully participating in the Syrian conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This setback suggests Russia has abandoned its claim to be a global player, losing its last military presence in the [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Middle East]] and Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Even with potential victories in Ukraine or Georgia, Russia has seemingly accepted its status as a regional power, primarily influencing areas directly surrounding its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The only remaining military presence outside the former Soviet Union is now in Africa's Sahel region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This indicates Russia has lost its ability to be an effective player on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the need for a counterbalance against the singular power of the United States and its Western military alliance, regardless of which nation provides it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Russia's reliability as a partner for actors like the Kurds has been severely undermined by these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

## Iran's Setback in Regional Ambitions

Iran has also suffered a significant defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For years, the Iranian regime has pursued a policy of establishing an area of influence in the [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Middle East]], a policy that has now faced defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] was considered a key gateway for Iran's ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While Iran holds significant influence in Iraq, particularly Southern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, its ability to reach the Mediterranean and continue supporting groups in Lebanon (which pose a military threat to Israel) depended on access through [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

By losing its influence in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]], Iran's capacity to project power beyond its immediate geographical limits has been severely curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This strategic shift may paradoxically lead Iran to seek a modus vivendi with the United States and even Israel, as the underlying strategic threat that fueled its hostility with the Western alliance has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Iran is now taking a significant step towards becoming a smaller or medium-sized state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]]'s Strategic Adaptation and Limited Gains

[[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] appears to have gained a certain, albeit small, advantage in these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The Turkish press highlights [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]]'s control over certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, and the world press reports its active involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The success of [[geopolitical_developments_involving_trkiye | Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s policy is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

However, [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]]'s share in the [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syrian]] outcome is considered quite small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Its controlled militia forces, like the Free Syrian Army, are effective mainly in two districts, Azaz and Afrin, and have somewhat expanded their boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. A tactical goal for [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] has been the capture of Manbij <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Despite limited direct gains, [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] will likely have a role in the reconstruction of [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

The speaker's impression, though potentially mistaken, is that these events were not primarily suited to [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]]'s objectives but rather that [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] was compelled to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] seemingly had no other choice but to participate on the victorious side of the US-Israel alliance against the Russia-Iran alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This was considered a wise choice given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Implications

The "great defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] is viewed as a significant victory for the United States and Israel, who have successfully implemented a long-prepared regional plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The success of the US strategy in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] is seen as a chess-like maneuver, achieving objectives without direct military engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

A major beneficiary of these changes will be the Kurds, who are expected to establish a largely independent region east of the Euphrates, akin to Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This new formation will necessitate a compromise from [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

The strategic invitations, such as Donald Trump inviting the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces to an inauguration ceremony, serve as important symbolic gestures of US support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This might signal a shift in US foreign policy, potentially ending a period of perceived losses in international conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Despite these power shifts, the Syrian people remain the primary losers of the conflict, with peace remaining a weak possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. The establishment of a stable central authority in [[the_complex_geopolitical_situation_in_syria_and_its_impact_on_turkey_israel_iran_and_russia | Syria]] after a revolution is extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.

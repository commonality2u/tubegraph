April 24 is commemorated globally, especially in Armenia, as the day of the 1915 Armenian Genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is described as a very emotional event, with the entire population walking to the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The speaker acknowledges a personal shift in attitude towards nationalist expressions but notes that a humanitarian event like this inevitably affects people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Events of April 24, 1915

The date April 24 is not directly related to the genocide itself, but to a political step taken just before it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities, 235 to 250 prominent figures of the Armenian community in the Ottoman Empire were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These individuals included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters – all known intellectuals with societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A few days later, some were sent to Ayaş and Çankırı in Anatolia; some managed to escape, but others were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

This operation is characterized as a "political collapse operation" similar to those seen in the [[political_history_of_Turkey | history of the Republic of Turkey]] and the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The state collected information and then suddenly moved to gather everyone, regardless of guilt or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly against extremist nationalist Armenian movements, or those with no organizational ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Similar operations occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The objective was to "cleanse" the political leaders and voices of the society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Starting in May, this led to the deportation of Armenian civilians, women, and children across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The situation escalated, turning into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Acknowledging the Genocide

The speaker states that discussing whether a genocide occurred is a waste of time and reflects ignorance of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Denial of the genocide is described as immoral, often stemming from both ignorance and immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. He asserts that the existence of the genocide is an obvious fact known worldwide, including by Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, with the sole exception of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The Turkish state, for various reasons, designed a genocide project starting around 1895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. From 1913, it systematically prepared the infrastructure for this, implementing it in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the Armenian and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Turkey's Policy Shifts

### Early Policy: Silence (1915-1975)

Until approximately 1975, Turkey's policy on the genocide was one of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Especially before 1965, there was no perceived need to engage in discussions on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. For 50 years, from 1915 to 1965, the Republic of Turkey's representatives acknowledged the genocide internally but chose not to discuss it publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### The 1965 Turning Point

In 1965, the genocide issue re-emerged on the global agenda for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This was initiated by the Soviet Union, specifically in Soviet Armenia, on the 50th anniversary of the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Despite some murmuring in Turkey during the Demirel governments, Turkey continued to prioritize a policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This stance was likely maintained because, before the 1960s, Turkey enjoyed a high reputation and protection in the Western world, where there was a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Shift to Active Denial (Post-1974)

The policy of silence abruptly changed around 1974 or 1975, shortly after Turkey's [[the_impact_of_turkeys_cyprus_intervention_on_international_relations | Cyprus operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. At this time, an organization named ASALA emerged, initiating attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Subsequently, the Armenian Genocide was prominently featured in the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Turkey responded by adopting a policy of active denial, which the speaker describes as "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This systematic denial, spearheaded by figures like Coşkun Kırca and Foreign Ministry officials, claimed that "nothing like this happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Once this policy was adopted, Turkey was unable to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This shift occurred because Turkey's international standing, particularly with Western allies, significantly declined after the 1974 Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. A strong opposition emerged against Turkey in Western countries, and its denial of a clear past crime was seen as impudence and rudeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This denial provided a "delicious excuse to provoke Türkiye, to hurt Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. For over 45 years, Turkey has suffered from this "stupid policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### A Brief Period of Hope (2005-2011)

Between 2005 and 2011, a "window of hope" appeared, suggesting Turkey might abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. During this period, there was significant public discussion of the genocide in Turkey, with mainstream media outlets like *Radikal*, *Milliyet*, *Hürriyet*, and even the then-balanced *Yeni Şafak* exploring the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Opinion leaders from both the right and left urged Turkey to confront the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. They acknowledged that, regardless of the term "genocide," a terrible event had occurred, causing misery to millions of Armenians and harming Turkey itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. The speaker believed that confronting this history would ease a "heavy burden of hypocrisy" and help society overcome a "mental illness" it had carried for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Broader Historical Context and Motivation

The Armenian Genocide is considered the most significant social and political event of the 20th century in Turkey, fundamentally changing the country's social composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. It formed the psychological and economic basis of Turkey's political transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This "cleansing" project also included Greek and Assyrian populations and had been advocated since the 1890s during Abdulhamid's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

The Union and Progress Party, after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, initially held an optimistic view that they could overcome these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. However, by 1909-1910, they began to revert to Abdulhamid's program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. After the Adana events of 1909, the party, which had initially worked with Armenian parties, concluded that a new Turkey could not be established without eliminating non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. By 1913, following the Balkan War and the party's return to power, the plans for the 1915 cleansing of Anatolia were fully prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

A key factor in the decision for massacres rather than deportation was the lack of an alternative destination for Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Unlike the Turks and Greeks who experienced mutual population exchanges (e.g., Turks expelled from Macedonia by Greece, and Greeks settling in vacated villages), there was no clear place for Armenians to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Deporting Armenians to potential enemy territory during World War I, especially when fighting Russia, would have been disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Although Syria was considered a destination if Russia left the war, it was eventually seen as an insufficient solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

The ultimate motivation for the cleansing and massacres was to prevent future claims for compensation, land, property, and assets once the war ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the need to face these facts for a healthier, calmer discussion, but notes that denial prevents any meaningful dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. The issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot," which Turkey has largely "overcame" in terms of international pressure, but at the cost of missing an opportunity for self-reflection and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

The [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | terrible earthquake]] that struck [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | Turkey and Syria]] in February 2023 has led to widespread destruction, prompting a critical examination of the role of contractors and construction practices in the scale of the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The event is described as an [[Impact of natural disasters on societies | unprecedented natural disaster]] of extraordinary dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Scale of Destruction
The earthquake caused "equal destruction along a line of 150-160 kilometers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It significantly impacted a region extending from the middle of Syria to Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Three provincial centers — Antakya, Maraş, and Adıyaman — were particularly devastated, with their cities facing immense challenges in recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Reports indicate severe structural damage:
*   In Antakya, "ten to 20 percent of the houses... have been completely reduced to rubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Maraş saw a "higher rate of thirty percent" of houses destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   It is suggested that "all the buildings in Adıyaman have been destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Almost 90% of buildings in Antakya, Maraş, and Adıyaman are considered uninhabitable, even those structurally sound, due to the complete collapse of surrounding infrastructure like grocery stores, gas stations, banks, and workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

The widespread destruction and the timing of the earthquake, which occurred at night when most people were home and sleeping, suggest a catastrophic loss of life, potentially in the hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Search for a Culprit
In the aftermath of such a disaster, a common human reflex is to "look for the guilty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This phenomenon has historical precedents, such as blaming Jewish communities after medieval earthquakes and plagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In [[political_and_social_reactions_to_natural_disasters | Türkiye]], this instinct manifested in two main directions: blaming Syrians or blaming contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

The speaker notes that both reactions, whether blaming "naughty looters" who are Syrians or "contractors" due to "zoning amnesty and the zoning laws were not sufficiently implemented by public officials," arise from a similar need to find a culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Assessing Responsibility
Determining a single source of blame for the construction failures is more complex than it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The economic reality in Türkiye dictates that building construction often occurs within limited budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If a contractor refuses a job due to budget constraints, another will likely take it, facing the pressure to earn a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Three primary actors are involved in construction:
1.  The property owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>
2.  The contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
3.  The zoning bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>

The speaker believes that if "all the buildings in a place have collapsed," responsibility should fall on "those who ignore the rules," not "those who set the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Most construction in Türkiye is undertaken not by the poor, but by middle-class individuals aiming to improve their social standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Construction Practices in Türkiye
Türkiye has an exceptionally high number of reinforced concrete buildings compared to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This preference for reinforced concrete, in a society that is not very rich and cannot allocate large funds for housing, leads to a particular outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The argument is that if there is no money and no other option than reinforced concrete, the current state of construction is an inevitable result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Challenges
Reversing the current urbanization understanding, which has been dominant since the 1960s and has led to "humanitarian disaster," would require a "great social revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. The majority of people prefer to live in cities for access to services, security, and comfort, rather than villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This preference has driven significant internal migration over the past 60 years, with settlements moving from high places to low places, and regional cities growing "like cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

Potential solutions like building two-story houses or horizontally expanding cities would destroy agricultural land and create severe traffic problems, implying that solutions might require a radical decrease in population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

## The State's Role in Construction
The state's duty to create a "decent and healthy living space for people" is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. Individuals or private groups are generally unable to create beautiful or safe living spaces due to existing legal frameworks, bureaucratic hurdles, and a social and legal structure primarily "based on making money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

Building a structure is a "job that requires public responsibility," affecting the quality of life and safety of future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. However, the current system prioritizes adherence to laws and earning money, with profit being the sole guiding idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. This leads to an impasse where either capitalists driven by profit or civil servants (who might worsen the situation) control construction, both being undesirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

## Conspiracy Theories and Trust
The widespread emergence of conspiracy theories post-earthquake is linked to a societal loss of trust in official information sources, including political leaders, experts, and the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. When official statements are perceived as lies, people seek alternative explanations, leading to hypotheses about hidden reasons behind events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

To evaluate such theories, two criteria are suggested:
1.  Do those proposing the theories have "a realistic idea of how the relevant authorities and institutions work," including knowledge of bureaucracy, foreign policy, and decision-making processes? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>
2.  Do they present their theories as absolute truths or as hypotheses, demonstrating an understanding of this difference? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>

The speaker notes that official theses have "no basis" anymore, meaning that theories presented as "logical hypothesis on a certain chain of reasoning should be respected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

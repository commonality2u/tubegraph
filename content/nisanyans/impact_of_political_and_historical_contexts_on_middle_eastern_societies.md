The political and historical trajectories of Middle Eastern societies have profoundly shaped their modern characteristics, from urban development and social structures to political loyalties and cultural identity. Comparisons between countries like Morocco and Turkey highlight these influences, demonstrating how historical events and colonial legacies continue to resonate in contemporary life.

## Modernity and Colonial Legacy
Morocco's urban areas exhibit a clean and orderly appearance, with modern parts of cities resembling Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Even intricate old neighborhoods are noted for their cleanliness, making Morocco a cleaner country than Turkey, Egypt, or Iran, suggesting a strong municipal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Rabat, for instance, is described as very green, orderly, and contemporary, offering all the conveniences and commercial services of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

A significant factor contributing to Morocco's distinct character is the lasting effect of 40-50 years of French rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. French is widely spoken, and official signs and offices predominantly use French, often not even using Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This colonial legacy has left a "European polish" on the society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Despite this, many aspects of the traditional social order have been preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Political Loyalty and Social Equivalence
In Morocco, a strong sense of loyalty to the King is evident. Slogans like "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (God, Homeland, King) are widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Photographs of the King are displayed in various establishments, from businesses to government offices and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Even among older and more conservative individuals, negative sentiments towards the King are not openly expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

An interesting social equivalence is observed when comparing Moroccan society to Turkey: middle-class, modern, secular-leaning women in Morocco exhibit a "fanatic king" loyalty, akin to the "fanatic Kemalists" found in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This suggests that the form of loyalty (to a monarch or a founding ideology) can be culturally similar despite differing political structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Historical Urbanism and Craft Traditions
Morocco's old cities, particularly Fez, have remarkably preserved their historical character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Unlike more heavily touristed areas like Marrakesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, the Fez Bazaar is larger and remains untouched by modern structures, maintaining its original details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The architecture, including doors, courtyards, palaces, and madrasahs, reflects a high level of civilization from centuries past, suggesting a period where it was seriously on par with or even superior to 15th-16th century Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This observation provides insight into the [[Influence of Historical Empires on Modern Societies | historical perspectives on Ottoman and Byzantine contexts]] and the broader [[cultural_and_societal_transformations_in_the_western_and_islamic_worlds | cultural and societal transformations in the Western and Islamic worlds]].

Furthermore, Moroccan cities like Fez exhibit active manufacturing trades, reminiscent of the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Unlike Turkey, where artisan traditions are largely diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, Morocco's bazaars feature active craftsmen producing high-quality handicraft goods, from carpentry to tile making, lamp making, and leatherwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. However, the observation that the average age of these craftsmen is over 50 suggests that this vibrant tradition may decline in 20-30 years as younger generations do not continue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Republican Era and Social Class Formation in Turkey
The establishment of the Turkish Republic marked a significant effort to create a new middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. This middle class, comprising literate urbanites and professionals (civil servants, lawyers, doctors, accountants, pharmacists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, was seen as central to modernization, a process that began in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. In Europe, this development largely paralleled the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, while in Eastern Europe, an urban middle class emerged later, in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

Before the Republic, Ottoman society was structured around peasant, tradesmen, warrior/state administrator, and clergy classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The 19th-century modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire led to the formation of a non-Muslim middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. However, this class, along with the institutions and habits of 19th-century modernization, was largely destroyed by the early 20th century crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

The Republic successfully created a new Turkish Muslim middle class from peasants and townspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This group became the primary advocates for Republican reforms and Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. However, the Republic did not bring significant equality of opportunity or prosperity to the larger peasant and working classes until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. While it succeeded in producing a middle class across towns and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>, it failed to cultivate a ruling elite, viewing such institutions as enemies and suppressing those who thought outside prescribed boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This approach, in the speaker's view, led to a society "with no heads" and ultimately produced a more miserable, uneducated, and ignorant society compared to 100 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

## Christianity and Sectarian Divisions
The historical development of Christian sects, particularly Syriacs and Nestorians, demonstrates the complex interplay of theological differences, political boundaries, and external influences in the Middle East.

### Syriac Christians
The term "Syriac" generally refers to the Syriac Ancient sect, also known as Jacobite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. This community historically had a strong presence in regions like Mardin, Aleppo, and Urfa, west of the Tigris River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Syriacs separated from the broader Christian world around 451 AD or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, continuing their existence within the Byzantine Empire's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

### Nestorians
Nestorians, who also speak and worship in Syriac, are a distinct group that separated in 431 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. They were expelled from the Byzantine world and settled in the Iranian world, with main centers east of the Tigris, including Mosul, Baghdad, and Siirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Their church rituals are generally conducted in the old Syriac Eastern dialect, and their writing differs slightly from Western Syriac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. In Turkey, Nestorians predominantly speak Kurdish as their mother tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.

### Catholic Influence and Chaldeans
Under European influence, some Syriacs and Nestorians recognized the Pope's superiority, partially as a means of protection from Turks and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. These groups, called Unat, adopted a unified Catholic sect while retaining their own traditions and worship beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. After about 100-150 years, some Nestorians broke ties with the Pope, claiming to return to their older beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. In Ottoman terminology, Nestorians loyal to the Pope became known as Chaldeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Chaldeans generally know Arabic as their common language, and their worship services include mentioning the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. In Mardin, for example, until the 1960s, five separate Syriac sects had churches, highlighting the rich sectarian diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

## Feudal Culture and State Allegiance
Kurdish culture is characterized as a feudal culture, defined by differing and opposing small-scale political formations engaged in endless struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. This contrasts with Turkish identity, which is fundamentally tied to loyalty to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Famous and successful Turks in history distinguished themselves through state service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. In contrast, Kurdish culture lacks a central institution like a church that historically unified its various factions, though some branches of the Naqshbandi order have sought to fulfill this function since the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

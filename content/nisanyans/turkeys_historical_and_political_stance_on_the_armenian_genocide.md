April 24 is commemorated globally, especially in Armenia, as the day of the 1915 [[Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This event is highly emotional, with entire populations walking to monuments in remembrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The [[Armenian Genocide]] is considered the most significant social and political event in 20th-century Turkey, fundamentally altering its societal composition and providing the psychological and economic basis for its political transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.

## The Event of April 24, 1915

The date April 24, 1915, marks a specific political step taken just before the genocide itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. On that night, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities, prominent figures of the Armenian community within the Ottoman Empire were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This group included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters—all known and influential Armenian intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Between 235 and 250 individuals were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. A few days later, some were sent to locations in Anatolia like Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. While some managed to escape, others were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

This operation is characterized as a "political collapse operation" similar to those seen in the [[turkish_historical_events | history of the Republic of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. It indiscriminately targeted prominent figures, including those who opposed extremist nationalist Armenian movements or had no organizational ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Similar operations occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat, where prominent Armenians were called to governor's offices, killed, and their bodies removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The intent behind this "cleansing" was to eliminate the political leaders and voices of the Armenian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Following these arrests, starting in May, the deportation of Armenian civilians, women, and children across the country began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This gradually escalated into a process of mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Shifting Stance on the Genocide

### The Policy of Silence (Pre-1975)

Until 1975, the Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the [[Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Especially until 1965, Turkey saw no need to engage in discussions on the topic, believing it was unnecessary to talk about or express an opinion on the subject, despite knowing the genocide had occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. The speaker notes that in the Western world, Turkey's reputation was high before the 1960s, and there was a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

The issue resurfaced globally in 1965, prompted by the Soviet Union, particularly in Soviet Armenia, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Even then, despite some grumbling in Turkey, the state did not take the issue seriously and continued its policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

### Shift to Denial (Post-1975)

A significant change in Turkey's stance occurred around 1974-1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Shortly after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974, the issue of the [[Armenian Genocide]] suddenly became prominent in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This period saw the emergence of ASALA, an organization that launched attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies, leading to the renewed remembrance of the [[Armenian Genocide]] in the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

In response, Turkey adopted a policy of denial, which the speaker describes as "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Key architects of this denial policy included names like Coşkun Kırca and Aktan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Once Turkey embarked on this path of systematic denial, it has been unable to reverse course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. The speaker argues this was a disastrous policy choice, especially given Turkey's declining international standing after 1974 due to the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This "impudence" and "rudeness" of denying a widely known past crime served as a convenient excuse for Western countries to provoke and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. Turkey has suffered from this policy for over 45 years, unable to show the foresight to step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

### A Period of Hope (2005-2011)

Between 2005 and 2011, a "window of hope" emerged for Turkey to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. During this period, there was an inclination in the mainstream Turkish media (e.g., Radical, Milliyet, Hürriyet, and even Yeni Şafak) to confront the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. For the first time, the genocide incident was openly discussed in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Many opinion leaders from both the right and left acknowledged that regardless of terminology, it was a terrible event where millions of Armenians, "the real children of this country," were destroyed and expelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. It was recognized as a "shameful incident" from which Turkey itself had suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. However, Turkey ultimately failed to take this courageous step at a state level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. Had it done so, Turkey could have shed the burden of hypocrisy and begun to overcome the [[Armenian Genocide]] as a "mental illness" it has carried for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

## The Inevitability of Genocide and Its Denial

The speaker asserts that denying the [[Armenian Genocide]] is either "ignorance" or "immorality," often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. It is presented as an obvious fact known globally, except for the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

The speaker explains that the Turkish state began designing a "genocide project" as early as 1895 and systematically prepared its infrastructure from 1913 onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. By 1915, this project was implemented, aiming to eliminate the Armenian and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

The "cleansing of Anatolia from non-Muslim population" was a project advocated since the 1890s during Abdulhamid's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. While the Union and Progress Party initially held an optimistic approach upon coming to power in 1908, they eventually returned to Abdulhamid's "mentality" and "program" by 1909-1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. By 1910-1911, the realization emerged that a "new Turkey could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.

After the Balkan War in 1912 and the Union and Progress cadres regaining power in 1913, all plans for 1915 were ready for the conscious and resolute project of cleansing Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. Unlike the population exchange with Greeks, where mutual population exchanges occurred and there was land for resettlement in Greece (e.g., Macedonia and Western Thrace), there was nowhere for the Armenians to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. The idea to deport Armenians to Syria was considered, but it quickly became clear that this was not a solution and that massacres were the only perceived option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. A key motivation for these actions was to prevent compensation claims for lands, houses, and assets once the war ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>.

As long as denial persists, the issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. While the speaker acknowledges that the world has largely moved on from using the issue as a "stick to poke Türkiye," an opportunity for Turkey to open new paths and horizons has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. The speaker, as a citizen of Turkey, believes confronting this issue is vital for Turkey to overcome its "diseases" and become a healthier society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The speaker emphasizes that discussing whether there was a genocide is a "waste of time" and a sign of "ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

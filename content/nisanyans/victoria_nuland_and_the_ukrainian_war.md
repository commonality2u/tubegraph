Victoria Nuland's resignation was noted as one of the most striking news stories worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. She held a position equivalent to an undersecretary or deputy undersecretary in the American Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Role in the [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukrainian War]]

Nuland is identified as the main architect of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukrainian War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The speaker states that the war began with a "masterfully planned and skillfully staged coup" in Ukraine in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This was described as a modern-style coup, not military, but involving the domination of bureaucratic structures, propaganda tools, street organizations, and secret organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Key events of the 2014 coup:
*   A "color revolution" movement was provoked, organized, and supported, based on partially justified reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   This movement was triggered by discussions over Ukraine signing a trade agreement with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   People gathered in the main square, demonstrating to overthrow the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Unidentified individuals opened fire on the crowd, resulting in hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Armed groups seized key locations in Odessa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   The Ukrainian parliament was raided, deputies were threatened, and the elected president was forced to resign and flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Victoria Nuland was the organizer of this coup, which marked the beginning of the [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukrainian War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Connection to Past Conflicts and Political Affiliations
Prior to her role in Ukraine, Nuland was also a leader and organizer of the Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, and played a significant part in "selling this war to the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. She is described as a loyal member of the "neo-conservative group," which is seen as having "effectively seized power in the United States in a coup" since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Nuland is considered a second-generation member of this group and a protégé of Dick Cheney, who served as Vice President under George W. Bush and was effectively the de facto president during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. She rose through the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Implications of Nuland's Resignation
Victoria Nuland's resignation, especially in an election year, is seen as an indication that "something is going very radically wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. It suggests that the decision-making leadership in the [[western_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | West]] has recognized that the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine War]] is lost and that its consequences will be "terrible, terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. This realization has led to panic and confused behavior among Western leaders, including statements by Macron about potential World War and disagreements within German military echelons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

The speaker expresses hope that Nuland and others responsible for these conflicts will be tried and sentenced for their crimes, drawing a parallel to the trials after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.

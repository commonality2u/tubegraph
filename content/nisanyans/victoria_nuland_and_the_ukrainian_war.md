Victoria Nuland's resignation was considered one of the most striking news stories worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. She held a position as the second or third minister, or an undersecretary or deputy undersecretary, within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. She is regarded as the main architect of the [[RussiaUkraine Conflict and NATO Involvement | Ukrainian War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Role in the 2014 Ukrainian Coup

In 2014, a "masterfully planned and skillfully staged coup" took place in Ukraine, which Nuland organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This was described as a "modern style" coup, relying on the domination of bureaucratic structures, propaganda tools, street organizations, and secret organizations working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The coup involved:
*   Provoking, organizing, and supporting a "color revolution" movement based on partially justified reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   A street movement that began when Ukraine considered signing a trade agreement with the [[Western countries and their approach to the Ukraine conflict | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   People gathering in the main square, demonstrating, and forming a protest movement aimed at overthrowing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Unidentified individuals opening fire on the crowd, resulting in hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Armed groups seizing key locations in Odessa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Armed groups raiding the Ukrainian parliament, threatening deputies, and forcing the elected president to resign and flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The [[RussiaUkraine Conflict and NATO Involvement | Ukrainian War]] is said to have begun with this coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Previous Involvement: The Iraq War

Before her role in Ukraine, Nuland was also a key organizer and one of the leaders of the Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. She played a major part in selling the war to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. She was identified as a loyal member of the neo-conservative group that gained significant power in the United States since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. She was also a protégé and trusted associate of Dick Cheney, who was the de facto president of the United States during the younger Bush's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Significance of Her Resignation

Victoria Nuland's forced resignation, especially in an election year, suggests that something is going "very radically wrong" regarding the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. It appears that decision-makers in the [[Western countries and their approach to the Ukraine conflict | West]] have realized that the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine War]] is lost and that its consequences will be severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This realization has led to panic and confused actions from [[current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_nato_and_russia | European]] leaders like Macron, who made statements about starting a World War, and Ursula Von Der Leyen, whose remarks reflected a "groundbreaking situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Major disagreements have also emerged within the German military echelons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

These behaviors are interpreted as responses to the likely loss of the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukrainian War]] in a short time and the understanding that the repercussions will be much worse than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. Nuland's resignation is seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. The hope is that individuals like her will be tried and sentenced for their crimes, similar to the trials after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

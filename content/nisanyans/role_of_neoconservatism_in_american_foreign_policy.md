NeoConservatism is a political movement that significantly influenced American foreign policy, particularly from the late 20th century into the 21st. The speaker characterizes its rise as a critical development in recent global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Origins and Ideological Roots
The NeoConservative movement began to emerge in the academic world and in journals during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. A key publication for this movement was *Commentary* magazine, associated with Norman Podhoretz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Many of the early writers for this magazine were former Marxists and even Trotskyists, who gradually shifted towards a more radical, "Neo Imperialist" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

## Core Tenets
The defining elements of the NeoConservative ideology, according to the speaker, are characterized by:
*   **American Dominance**: The belief that America must dominate the world, as "it cannot be done otherwise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. This is based on the idea that America is the "natural owner of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Moral Discourse**: The necessity to bring a moral discourse, such as democracy, human rights, and freedom, to the forefront, as propaganda is deemed "more important than anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Hostility Towards Russia**: A categorical hatred towards [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]], believing it "must be transmitted back, Russia must be disintegrated and destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. This hostility is described as stemming from growing up during the Cold War years and perceiving [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]] as a necessary enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This is also seen as an "anachronistic obsession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **"Adolescent Ideology"**: The speaker critiques the NeoConservative ideology as one of "ignorance, prejudice and arrogance, self-importance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, labeling it an "adolescent ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. This is attributed to a lack of moral basis, historical knowledge, and a sense of tradition among those who graduated from universities after 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

## Rise to Prominence
NeoConservatives started to exert increasing influence in the late 1990s, particularly during the Clinton administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. Their power escalated dramatically from 2000 onwards, collapsing into power with the second Bush presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. After the September 11th attacks, this group "completely took over America's Internal and External Security policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Figures like the Kristol family are mentioned as prominent within this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

Initially, they dominated the American Foreign Ministry, then the Pentagon during the Wallpapit period (likely a mispronunciation of a person or period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, and eventually the political guidance cadres of the Pentagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

### Political Allegiance Shift
Prior to 2016, NeoConservatives were largely aligned with the Republican Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. However, when Donald Trump took over the Republican Party in 2016, they changed sides and joined the Democratic Party, now purportedly "running the country, running the world" through the Democratic Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Impact on American Foreign Policy
The speaker contrasts the NeoConservative approach with earlier [[United States foreign policy and financial adjustments | American foreign policy]], which until the end of the Cold War (around 1980) was managed by a cadre with "very strong and deep intellectual bases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. This earlier policy, while often "cruel" and "ruthless," never displayed the "cowboyism" seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

The NeoConservative influence is seen as leading to a destructive approach, exemplified by interventions in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The U.S., under their influence, is portrayed as having "no experience in developing a country or supporting it" in the last 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. Their strategy towards [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]] is to "pull the plug" and "drag it into the first war," then "wash their hands of it and withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. This is deemed a "crime against humanity" that must be prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

### Geopolitical Implications
The NeoConservative agenda is seen as actively working against a natural alliance between Europe and [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]]. A unified Europe that includes [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]] (with its natural resources) and the rest of Europe (with its capital and population to process them) is presented as essential for Europe's sustained superior position in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. The "American cowboys" perceive this potential alliance as a threat to themselves and aim to destroy [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. England is noted as being even more aggressive than the U.S. in disrupting [[Political and social commentary on international relations | Germany]]-[[Political and social commentary on international relations | Russia]] relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>.

## Ethnic and Cultural Observations
The speaker notes that a significant majority of this NeoConservative group (90%) are Eastern European Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. While the speaker explicitly states he does not find the view of "Jews as an organization directing the world somewhere" convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a>, he suggests that "some handicaps coming from cultural past, ethnic origin, family tradition" seem clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>. He reiterates that *Commentary* magazine was specifically a Jewish magazine dealing with the problems of Jewish society and thought, and that the "political and ideological cadre that dominates America today was raised from that magazine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

A significant moral crisis and management crisis are evident in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. This extends beyond Türkiye's borders, with similar trends observed in approximately half of the world, particularly in Western countries like North America, as well as in Latin American countries, African countries, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. China and, to a lesser extent, Russia, are noted exceptions to this trend of social disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

## Manifestations of Decay

*   **Rising Crime and Depression**
    Incidents such as rape, murder, and mugging have become increasingly prevalent, both in society and on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. A segment of society, especially men, is experiencing intense depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. This is accompanied by an "endless hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The spread of murder and brutality news on social media is seen as a sign of real social decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.
*   **Spread of Violence**
    The speaker uses a "zombie" analogy to describe how evil spreads like a contagious disease, where attempting to protect oneself by joining in aggressive behavior (e.g., getting a gun) inadvertently makes one part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This cyclical nature means that once violence starts to spiral, it continues to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Anomie and Hopelessness**
    An incredible social disintegration and a widespread sense of helplessness and anomie are prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. Anomie implies a loss of rules, laws, and moral principles, leading to the dominance of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. A great sense of hopelessness has gripped society, particularly the younger generation and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. This includes a lack of purpose, career opportunities, or ideals to strive for, and the expectation that life will not improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>. Marriage and raising children have become increasingly difficult burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Danger of Hopeless Young Men**
    The speaker identifies young men consumed by hopelessness as "the most dangerous creature in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

## Underlying Causes

The crisis is multifaceted, stemming from several interconnected issues:

*   **Crisis of Modernity, Liberal Economy, and Democracy**
    The underlying causes are linked to the crisis of modernity, the liberal economy, and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Migration and Rootlessness**
    Mass migration from villages to cities has had negative effects, primarily by eliminating the sense of societal belonging that once tethered individuals to their ancestral communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. This process of making people "rootless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a> and "familyless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a> leads to individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, undermining the civilizing influence of community bonds.
*   **Economic Crisis and Decline of the Middle Class**
    The ideal of a stable middle class, where young people could afford a home and secure a decent life with pension benefits, has "exploded" since the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>. It has become nearly impossible for young people to own a house without significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.
*   **Education's Lost Function**
    The widespread availability of university education has paradoxically led to its loss of function, failing to prepare individuals to be useful and respected members of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Civilizing Institutions**
    The traditional institutions that fostered civilized life, such as family and the broader social environment, have been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of Basic Welfare and Traditional Pillars**
    In addition to economic hardship, the absence of basic welfare, coupled with the erosion of other pillars that traditionally provided strength and meaning—such as belief, congregational family, and religious figures (`Hacı Hoca`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>—has exacerbated the crisis.

## Consequences and Future Outlook

The current situation is dangerous and is expected to worsen significantly before any improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

*   **Ungovernability:** Societies cannot be effectively governed purely through police measures; such measures can only manage a crisis or transition period, not an entire society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. For police governance to be effective, individuals, especially those in power, must be constantly vigilant in protecting society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **Rebellion as a Symptom:** The acts of violence and brutality seen are not the disease itself but rather symptoms of a deeper societal illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. These actions, even if morally wrong, can be understood as forms of "rebellion" stemming from desperation and an impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. Ignoring the underlying desperation that drives people to such extremes is deemed foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. The speaker, having personal experience with individuals pushed to rebellion, emphasizes that these behaviors are a consequence of profound societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

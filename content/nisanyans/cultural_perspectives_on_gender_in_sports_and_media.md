This article explores various [[cultural_and_societal_norms | cultural and societal norms]] related to gender, particularly as they manifest in sports and, by extension, media portrayal.

## Gender in Sports: A Critical View

The speaker holds a critical stance on gender-segregated sports, especially regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes.

### The Case of Women's Boxing

An incident involving "men disguised as women" participating in Olympic women's boxing matches is highlighted [00:20:33]. One such individual reportedly "destroyed the Italian boxer with three punches," leading to a quick surrender and the Italian boxer crying [00:20:59].

The speaker expresses the belief that women's boxing itself is a "perversion" and "morally wrong" [00:21:21]. A perceived inconsistency is noted: it is deemed "normal for a woman to be beaten until her face and eyes are covered in blood by another woman," but "not normal" when "she gets this beating from a man or when she gets this beating from a man disguised as a woman" [00:21:41]. The core objection is to the act of "women getting beaten" in a way that leaves them "covered in blood," regardless of the gender of the opponent [00:22:01]. This perspective suggests that "in principle, we should be against women being beaten" [00:22:25].

### Transgender Athletes and Sports

The phenomenon of "an increasing number of transgender people are dressing up as women and collecting medals" is observed across various sports, including swimming and women's football [00:22:37]. This situation is attributed to an "inevitable logical contradiction" [00:23:06].

#### The Principle of "The Strong Win"

The fundamental principle of sports competitions, beyond being a "show" for "making money and advertising," should be that "the strong win" [00:23:26]. The identity of the strong, whether "male or female, perverted or homosexual," should not matter [00:23:32]. The ultimate winner should be "the one who runs faster, jumps higher," or "whoever... has developed his body" [00:23:40].

#### Categorization and Contradiction

If sports are divided into two categories, one for the "strong" (the "best in the world") and a "second league competition" like a "Junior League" or "consolation prize," then the women's league is considered this "second league" [00:23:53]. The speaker argues that in such a setup, there will always be uncertainty and debate regarding whether competitors in the "second league," or "Women's League," are truly qualified or have the right to compete there [00:24:29].

#### Proposal for Women's Sports

Given this perceived contradiction, the speaker suggests that "the issue of women's sports should be canceled at least at the Olympic level" [00:24:56]. This is viewed as being "against the Olympic ideal," which is encapsulated by the Latin phrase "citius, altius, fortius" (faster, higher, stronger) [00:25:28]. The inclusion of those who are "not the strongest, the less strong, the less able to run, the less able to throw, the less able to jump" is seen as being "against the Olympic idea in principle" [02:26:00].

It is acknowledged that the "Olympic Idea is not really as claimed," but rather primarily serves to "provide advertising revenue, to stage a big production, to provide a big return" [02:26:17]. From this commercial perspective, it becomes "a very logical thing" for "women can compete, disabled people can compete," as "various artificial fights are started in every field" to maintain "public interest" [02:26:34].

## Gender in Media and Society

While not directly addressed as "media," there's an implicit discussion on societal perceptions of gender.

### Hitchhiking and Perception

When offering advice on successful hitchhiking, the speaker notes that "if possible, to have a woman with you" makes one appear "sympathetic and humble" and avoids a "threatening appearance" [01:29:57]. This suggests a societal perception where women are generally viewed as less threatening or more approachable, influencing interactions and outcomes.

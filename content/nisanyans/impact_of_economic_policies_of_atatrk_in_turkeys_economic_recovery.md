Turkey, like the rest of the world, was significantly impacted by the global economic crisis of 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. This crisis led to rapid capital depletion, loss of value, cessation of business investments, and a widespread wave of unemployment and hopelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. At this time, Turkey was just beginning to recover from the aftermath of the First World War and was attempting to restart its economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. The private sector was largely exhausted and went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

## Government Response to the Crisis

In response to the crisis, the Turkish government, under Atatürk, implemented several key policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. These policies were not unique to Turkey but mirrored measures taken by other European countries and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>, including Hungary and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

The main policies included:
*   **State-led Investment:** When private sector investments ceased, the state stepped in to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. While the profitability of these ventures is debated, they did help address the unemployment problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   **Import and Export Controls:** The government introduced controls over imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.
*   **Temporary Measures:** The Turkish government viewed these interventions as temporary and necessary measures, not a permanent shift towards state control of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. The stated intention was to return to normal economic operations over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. Some intellectuals, however, advocated for a more statist and totalitarian economic model, citing examples from Germany and the Soviet Union, but these suggestions were generally not taken seriously by the Turkish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

The outbreak of World War II immediately followed this period, which further postponed economic liberalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. It was only after 1946 that economic activity gradually returned to its natural course, and the state's share in the economy was reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

Overall, the economic policies implemented during Atatürk's era in response to the 1929 crisis are considered logical and inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. They were necessary crisis management measures, and the government handled them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

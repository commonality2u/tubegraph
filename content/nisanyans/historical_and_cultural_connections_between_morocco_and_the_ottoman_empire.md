From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The **Ottoman Empire** was considered one pole of the Islamic world, with Morocco representing another phenomenon on the opposite end of that pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Despite not being on the same scale as the Ottomans, Morocco emerged from similar historical and social conditions, sharing a comparable history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Examining the [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | similarities and differences between the two countries]] can offer valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Ottoman Civilian Housing Architecture

The Ottoman civilian residential architecture is not monolithic, comprising two primary architectural styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

### Istanbul-centric Architecture
One style is centered in Istanbul and extends approximately a thousand kilometers in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. This architectural area covers regions from Albania through Macedonia, Rumelia, western Anatolia, and eastward to Amasya and Kayseri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. Key features include the prominence of bay window protrusions, with upper floors often extending outwards over the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Standard construction typically involves a stone-built lower floor and a wooden upper floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>.

This architecture, common in places like Safranbolu, Bursa, Edirne, Bulgaria, and Skopje, is notable for its beauty, poetic quality, and sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. Its reliance on wood was due to its abundance and affordability in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.

### Eastern Architecture
Moving east or southeast from the Istanbul-centric region, particularly towards Mardin, Urfa, and Syria, a completely different architectural tradition emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. These structures often feature flat roofs and ascend in amphitheater-like tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

### Architectural Class Distinction
What is commonly referred to as Ottoman housing architecture is primarily the architecture of the ruling class, exemplified by grand houses with cedars and bay windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. Ordinary people typically lived in shanties and less desirable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The idea of reviving this specific Ottoman housing architecture in modern Turkey is considered a fantasy, due to the scarcity of quality wood and the absence of the class distinctions that once made it feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. While a full revival is not possible, some valuable architectural ideas could be extracted and learned from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>.

### Urban Reform
If urban reform were to be undertaken in Turkey, the speaker suggests that instead of abandoning modern architecture and attempting to strictly replicate past styles, a consultative approach would be best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. This would involve holding extensive consultation meetings with residents, possibly including broader-minded individuals, to determine what they desire for a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. It would also involve setting aside existing zoning bureaucracy and traditional construction professionals (architects, engineers, urban planners) and instead bringing together the actual users of the city, along with philosophers and cultural historians, to foster fresh thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

## Ottoman Society and Governance

### Albanian Influence in the Ottoman Empire
Albanians played a significant role within the Ottoman state. The Albanian Bey class served as loyal servants and allies of the Ottoman State, consistently securing powerful positions within the Ottoman hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. They undertook crucial tasks in governing non-Muslim populations in the Balkans, acting as representatives and loyal forces of the Ottoman and Muslim powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>. As a result, many individuals of Albanian origin were present in the Ottoman ruling classes, military classes, and ulema (religious scholars) and cultured classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>. This reflects the [[cultural_and_educational_aspects_of_the_ottoman_ruling_class | cultural and educational aspects of the Ottoman ruling class]].

Mass migration of ordinary Albanians to Turkey, however, generally did not originate from the country of Albania itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. After the Balkan Wars, large numbers of Muslim Albanians from regions that came under Christian rule (such as Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro, especially Kosovo) migrated to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. Most Albanians in Turkey today are of Macedonian or Kosovar origin, with some from Yenipazar Sanjak or Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>. Post-1912, direct migration from Albania was minimal until recent economic and political crises in Albania led to a small influx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.

Albanians in Turkey can be categorized into three groups: the "old Ottoman Albanians," those who migrated from Yugoslavia and Greece between 1912 and the 1960s, and a small number who arrived from Albania after the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>. The first two groups typically have classical Muslim names, while the third group, influenced by Albania's past secular policies under Enver Hoxha, often have secular Albanian names not traditionally common in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.

### Kurdish Migrations and Ottoman Policies
Starting from the 16th century with major crises and continuing into the early 20th century, there has been continuous migration of populations from the Eastern provinces to the Western provinces of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. For centuries, many Kurds lived a nomadic lifestyle, wintering in regions like Syria, Iraq, or southeastern Turkey, and moving to the Anatolian steppe in the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

Ottoman records often depict the annual mass migration of Kurds to the Anatolian steppe as a source of problems, including looting, murder, theft, and conflict with settled agricultural societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. These nomadic groups often refused to submit to the Ottoman State, avoiding taxes and tributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. Consequently, the Ottomans periodically intervened to settle these groups, viewing their sedentarization as a fundamental duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

Particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of people from the east—including Turkish, Kurdish, and Arabic speakers—were forcibly settled throughout Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>. By examining village morphology, one can distinguish ancient agricultural villages from those established by nomadic groups (Turkmen, Kurdish, Arab, Gypsy) who primarily engaged in animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. These settled communities often occupied marginal lands, as fertile plains were already inhabited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

Thousands of Kurdish settlements were established through these Ottoman settlement policies in Central Anatolia, including Çorum, Kırşehir, the Konya plain (Cihanbeyli, Haymana, Yunak), Çiçekdağı, and Aksaray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Many of these Kurds, being far from their traditional lifestyle and princely order, assimilated over the last two centuries, forgetting Kurdish and adapting to the dominant culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

### Sexuality in Ottoman Culture
Bisexuality, or sleeping with both men and women with equal ease, was "extremely common" in Ottoman culture up to the early 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (Fatih Sultan Mehmet), for example, reportedly had both a harem for women and a "pen for men," indicating relations with boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>. Approximately half of Ottoman poetry delves into themes comparing intimate relations with women and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>. Evliya Çelebi's writings also suggest extensive sexual encounters across three continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. This societal acceptance of diverse sexual practices seemingly diminished abruptly in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.

## Ottoman Decline and Political Context

The speaker often references the Ottoman Empire in discussions about Turkey's modern political state. The idea that Turkey's democratic period has ended is a long-held view, with the current government having centralized bureaucratic, legal, and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The speaker contends that a democratic opening is not permitted, suggesting elections would conform to the ruling party's preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The democratic system, which has been an absolute value for enlightened people in the Western world since the 19th century and in Turkey since the mid-20th century, no longer functions effectively in Turkey or globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The underlying assumptions that made democracy attractive have vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. These include a common value system accepted by society and a class of wise individuals who uphold it above vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The speaker believes such a class of intellectuals or elders no longer exists, making democratic struggle difficult to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Governments elected by democratic votes hold no real value in a society where armed and unarmed bureaucracy has become so powerful and dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. State power, concentrated in the hands of political cadres integrated with bureaucracy, financial resources, and armed forces (including police and intelligence), creates an uneven playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Under these conditions, fair competition between ruling and opposition parties is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The legal system, compared to a football referee, is ineffective when its authority is undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

All conditions for a dictatorial government have been established in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. Turkey's foreign policy is considered of vital importance compared to its internal political conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. As a NATO member, Turkey has limited independence from the American front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>. The speaker believes Turkey's foreign policy for the past 15-20 years, especially after the collapse of Syria, aims for a more independent stance within the Western alliance to minimize external harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. This policy is more likely the result of the "deep state's" collective mind than any individual's preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. Any government, regardless of party, is unlikely to deviate from these determined main lines of foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>.

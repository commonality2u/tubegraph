The [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian issue]] is described not merely as the 1915 incident, but as the culmination of a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Kurdish Role Pre-1915 Genocide

Prior to 1915, the Kurdish element is identified as the "real tyrant" of the Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Kurdish tribal leaders and later, Kurdish sect sheikhs, controlled Kurds who were "experts in killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

For a long time, up until the last quarter of the 19th century, Armenians consistently preferred to view Turks and the Ottoman State as their allies and protectors against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It was typical for Armenians to seek refuge with the Ottoman governor and ask for help against the attacks of Kurdish aghas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Kurdish Involvement in the 1915 Annihilation Project

The 1915 incident is characterized as a conscious, cold-blooded "annihilation project" undertaken by the Union and Progress administration of the Turkish state and the Ottoman bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This project aimed to completely cleanse the Armenian problem, which had persisted for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In executing this, the state extensively organized and utilized Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish people as allies, helpers, and subcontractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an existing Kurdish tradition of massacre and extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The Turkish state successfully exploited this tradition in the Eastern provinces, effectively granting permission to the Kurds by implying state support for their actions ("you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Shifting Kurdish Attitudes Towards the Armenian Issue

Recent studies suggest that around 1880, there was significant hostility directed more towards the Armenian Church than the Armenian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

After a certain point (following the abolition of "high school," a term that might be a misinterpretation), looters disappeared from the Anatolian countryside, and there was no longer property to usurp or women to be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It was then that Kurds "came to their senses," realizing they were now directly confronting the Turkish state, which had the capacity to destroy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Over the last 20 to 30 years, the [[changes_in_kurdish_attitudes_towards_the_armenian_issue | Kurdish attitude]] and approach towards the Armenian issue have undergone a radical and appreciable transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This shift is seen as a positive development, encouraging a similar self-reflection among Turks regarding their own prejudices and ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This evolving perspective contributes to the broader context of [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Kurdish-Turkish relations]].

The nature of power, particularly in dictatorial regimes, presents inherent paradoxes and challenges, leading to diminished freedom for the rulers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

## Power Cliques in the USA

Since 2001, a specific cadre has been increasingly gaining power in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This group systematically dismantled the state apparatus after the 2001 Twin Towers attack, transforming America's democratic traditions into a "fraud and a buffoon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This cadre has managed to permanently seize [[power_dynamics_and_elite_control_in_western_societies | power]] by sabotaging inter-party competition and increasingly dominating the ideology and institutions of a national security state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The election of Trump represented a "rupture" in this cadre's process of absolutizing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This ruling group operates under the principle that rules are adhered to only when convenient, otherwise they are disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. It appears "extremely difficult or even impossible" to remove this structure from power through normal political procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Such a change would likely require:
*   A "very large and very radical financial crisis" leading to the state's inability to pay debts or salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   A civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Without one of these, it seems impossible to remove the current "mountain of power" in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## The Paradox of Dictatorship

The notion that one must be a [[the_concept_of_dictatorship | dictator]] to be truly free – a person ruling over many with singular will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a> – is challenged by historical observation. In reality, a dictator's freedom tends to decrease, not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. After establishing unlimited power through great struggle, a dictator risks becoming a "puppet" captured by the very mechanisms they created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Their relative autonomy against those around them disappears, leading to a tragic, rather than heroic, outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.

### Psychological Burdens of Power
Dictators face the daily fear of death and assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. As a dictator's authority grows, dissenting voices are silenced, making open objection dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. This leads to an inability to be sure of the loyalty of those who obey silently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. To test loyalty, dictators must resort to "increasingly more violent lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. The demand for unquestioning affirmation, even of absurd falsehoods (e.g., "The capital of England is Çemişgezek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>), becomes a constant test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. When even the slightest hesitation in affirming these lies is perceived, it leads to the execution of those perceived as disloyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

This shrinking "area of the test of loyalty" creates a terrible fear: the knowledge that when power is lost, those who feigned worship will be the first to turn against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

### Historical Examples of Dictatorial Misery
The first president of the Republic of Turkey, after establishing a collapsed state through an "incredibly big and very risky and very difficult and very impossible task," became a "prisoner" in the Çankaya mansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This led to depression and deep disappointment during his years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. Out of boredom or a feeling of being trapped, he initiated "imaginary wars" and "crazy new projects" such as the alphabet mobilization or rewriting history and re-creating the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. This illustrates how a powerful leader, once addressing real crises, might turn to quixotic struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>.

### Literature and Art as Insights
The dilemmas of dictatorship are explored in various forms of literature:
*   Benjamin Constant's long article (80-90 pages) on Napoleon, an "extraordinarily bright and intelligent propaganda brochure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:42">[01:51:42]</a>.
*   Biographies, literature, and theater history, particularly most of Shakespeare's plays, delve into "the misery of power" and "the impossibility of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:04">[01:53:04]</a>.

## Power Dynamics in Turkish Politics
The level of public politics and discourse in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]] is described as "underground" and "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This decline has been consistent over decades, from Süleyman Demirel and Özal to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Devlet Bahçeli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>.

Süleyman Demirel, despite being an intellectual and well-read, adopted a "patriotic language" in politics due to constantly operating under the "dark shadow" of Adnan Menderes's execution and the May 27 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. Facing numerous coups and coup attempts throughout his career, he concluded that in Turkey, one must comply with the military's demands and adopt their culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.

## Historical Power Shifts and Conflicts
### Armenian-Kurdish Relations
The Armenian genocide was not solely the 1915 incident but the "final blow" of a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, and usurpation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>. Prior to 1915, the primary oppressor of Armenians, forcing them to flee their homeland, was the Kurdish element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>. Kurdish tribal leaders and sheikhs specialized in killing Armenians, seizing their property, and destroying their churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>. Armenians historically sought protection from the Ottoman state against Kurdish attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:43">[01:35:43]</a>.

In 1915, the Turkish state, under the Union and Progress administration, consciously and coldly decided to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>. They used Kurdish lords and people as "allies and helpers and subcontractors" due to an existing tradition of massacre and extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. The state's implicit approval — "you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you" — fueled these actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>.

Recent studies indicate a significant hostility towards the Armenian Church, rather than the Armenian nation itself, among those who carried out these actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. A large majority of those who destroyed churches and killed priests were Armenians from "one generation ago" who had converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. The Armenian population in regions like Gevaş, Alızanla, and Bahçe Saray radically decreased from the 1840s to 1880, not due to massacres, but primarily due to "change of side" (conversion to Islam), often accompanied by deep hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:57">[01:38:57]</a>.

The attitude of Kurds towards the Armenian issue has changed radically in the last 20-30 years, which is viewed as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. It is hoped that Turks will also overcome their prejudices and ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

### [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | Global Political Dynamics and Conflicts]] and Israel
Radical changes are occurring in Israel, including a regime shake-up with Benjamin Netanyahu's return as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. The long-standing alliance between [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | Israel]] and the United States is showing signs of wear and tear, possibly for the first time since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Israel adopted a separate stance from the Western alliance during the Ukraine War, which was unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

Israel's aggressive approach in the region, relying on American hegemony, including threats against Iran and actions in Syria, is now challenged by developments like the alliance between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. The understanding that American military presence in Syria cannot be sustained is significantly altering Israel's options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>. It is hoped that Israeli administrators will reconsider their increasingly fanatic and bigoted stance and return to the "flexibility and rationality" that the Jewish nation has historically shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>.

## [[legal_system_and_state_power | Legal System and State Power]] and Conscientious Objection
Conscientious objection, defined as rejecting military service for moral or religious reasons, is deeply rooted in Christian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. This tradition, dating back to Tsarist Russia, allowed for flexibility due to the separation of church and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

In contrast, in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]], there is no such tradition; "being a Muslim means being a soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>. Islam traditionally mandates physical combat (Jihad) as a Muslim's duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. The emergence of conscientious objection in Turkey is seen as a crisis related to modernization, where Turkey attempts to adopt Western behavioral patterns while clinging to its traditional Turkish and Muslim identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>.

However, military service is gradually shifting from general conscription to professional armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. In professional armies, the concept of conscientious objection becomes irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>. While individuals have an indispensable human right to conscientious objection, the speaker encourages young men, including his own sons, to experience military service for self-knowledge and understanding society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>.

## Social Conflict and the Herd Instinct
Fighting is a fundamental human instinct, as strong as making peace, and not fighting can lead to incompleteness and the loss of abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>. A primary human instinct is the "herd instinct" – a strong desire to protect one's own group and destroy enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:23">[01:45:23]</a>.

The "dead end of the nation-state" is its attempt to reduce this complex, multi-layered sense of belonging (to sect, province, region, village, tribe, social class) to a singular, common identity for 85 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>. This effort to eliminate the polyphony of identity leads to a "stupid" society that destroys its "human richness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a>. While fighting can be healthy, people who adopt an overly abstract ideal of "loving humanity" (which often means loving no one) become weak, lose their sense of truth and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. The "normal thing" is to love one's own group, but the modern world presents contradictory dilemmas regarding this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:53">[01:48:53]</a>.

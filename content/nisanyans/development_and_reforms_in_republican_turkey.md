The 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic was anticipated to be marked by grand ceremonies and enthusiastic celebrations, with some expecting significant [[political_history_of_turkey | political events]] like a new constitution [00:01:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, these expectations largely went unfulfilled [00:02:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Compared to the 80th and 90th anniversaries, the 100th appeared ordinary and unimportant, reflecting a deliberate government policy [00:02:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, [00:02:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

While a small group attempted to generate enthusiasm through demonstrations and social media [00:03:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, the overall sentiment across the country suggested the 100th anniversary did not hold significant meaning [00:03:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. From a broader historical perspective, the Republic of Turkey can be viewed as an episode in a continuous state tradition that began around 1453 or even earlier [00:04:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, [00:04:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Continuities with the Ottoman State

Despite the change in name, the country has always been known as Türkiye to foreigners [00:06:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The state's narrative of its own history, from Fatih and Yavuz to Abdulhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Tayyip Erdoğan, demonstrates a clear continuity [00:07:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Institutions like the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police Organization, land registry, and population administration show an obvious continuity rather than a break due to regime change [00:08:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, [00:08:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The Republic of Turkey is seen as a revised version of the Ottoman State, adapted to the conditions of the new era [00:09:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The collective identity of the people has remained largely unchanged, transitioning from self-identifying as "Muslims" to "Turks" [00:09:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, [00:09:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Foreigners had always referred to Ottoman Muslims as "Turks" [01:10:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.

Furthermore, the ruling cadres of the Republic were largely continuous with the elite of the old state, having graduated from the same elite schools and served in the same armies [01:11:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Ottoman laws, which had already begun to be reformed and rewritten based on European models since the 1840s, also showed clear continuity [01:12:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>, [01:12:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. The Republic also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State [01:12:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>. Many traditions, customs, and habits persisted from the Ottoman period into the Republic [01:13:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. Turkish remained the dominant language, although serious reforms in its usage style were made from the 1930s onwards [01:13:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>, [01:13:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

## Key Changes and Reforms

Despite strong continuities, the Republican period brought significant changes.

### Sociological Transformation
One of the most profound [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | sociological changes in Turkey]] was the transformation of the "Sovereign Nation" concept [01:15:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. In the Ottoman State, the Muslim/Turkish segment was the sovereign nation in a multi-ethnic order [01:16:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. This structure began to shake with the Tanzimat reforms and underwent significant upheavals, leading to the liquidation of non-Muslim elements from the Anatolian and Rumelian population, a process that started in the 19th century and continued through the Republic until the 1980s [01:16:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>, [01:17:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>, [01:18:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. As a result, the previously "Sovereign Society" either became or aimed to become a single nation [01:17:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

### Expansion of Bureaucracy and Education
A second major change was the expansion of the modern state, requiring a growing and diversifying bureaucratic staff [01:20:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>, [01:21:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>. This global trend led to a tremendous increase in literate individuals capable of administrative work [01:21:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. After a period of stagnation and wars, the Republic saw a significant increase in the number of people integrated into state cadres, from approximately 10,000 nationwide to 100,000 [01:22:32]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>, [01:23:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>, [01:23:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. This expansion, while increasing quantity, led to a serious decrease in quality [01:24:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. These new cadres, often from Anatolia and Rumelia, became loyal supporters of the Republican regime as it provided them opportunities [01:24:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>, [01:25:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.

### Political System Change: Head of State Selection
The most specific and different aspect of the Republic was the change in the method of electing the head of state [01:37:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>. The centuries-old model of hereditary succession, where power passed from father to son, was replaced by a system where a head of state is elected by parliamentary notables and approved by the public [01:37:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">[01:37:59]</a>, [01:42:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>, [01:42:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>. This shift was part of a global trend following World War I, where monarchies collapsed in Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, and republics were established in places like China [01:38:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

## Evaluation of Revolutionary Enthusiasm and Outcomes

In the 1920s and 30s, Turkey, particularly its administrative cadres, experienced great revolutionary excitement [01:27:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. This was fueled by the collapse of the old regime and a global post-WWI sentiment to rebuild on rational foundations, abandoning old habits that led to disaster [01:28:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>, [01:28:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. This idealism was strong in circles close to the regime until the 1940s [01:29:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>.

However, the end result is summarized as "much talk and little action" [01:29:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>. Comparisons to other countries like Russia (under Catherine the Great and Stalin) show that despite similar starting points, Turkey's [[challenges_of_modernization_in_turkey | modernization]] efforts did not achieve the same radical societal transformation [01:30:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>, [01:31:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>, [01:32:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. While Russia built cities, parks, libraries, and museums from scratch, creating a civilization, Turkey's claims of bringing the country to "the level of contemporary civilization" did not fully materialize [01:32:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>, [01:33:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>, [01:33:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

The revolutionary excitement faded after 1938-39 [01:33:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The reforms were superficial, and the administrative cadres were insufficient [01:34:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>. Many of the Republic's founders gained power and wealth through "plunder" during the elimination of non-Muslims, and their main concern was self-preservation [01:34:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. Mustafa Kemal Pasha and his small core cadre tried to instill dynamism, but after his death, traditional thinking returned [01:35:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>, [01:35:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:43">[01:35:43]</a>.

> "People who attempt big things lack the equipment, power, culture and numbers to accomplish these big things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>

The inadequacy was found within the administrative cadres, not necessarily in the broader sociological infrastructure [01:36:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>.

## The Role of Regime Change in Development

Questions regarding whether the Republic's establishment directly caused positive developments like decreased child mortality, increased lifespan, population growth, improved public health, literacy rates, urbanization, and university graduates are met with skepticism [01:44:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>, [01:45:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. The argument is that these trends are global and have occurred in nearly 200 states worldwide, regardless of whether they are monarchies or republics [01:45:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>, [01:45:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:21">[01:45:21]</a>, [01:45:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>. Countries like Iran (a monarchy for long), Jordan (a kingdom), Japan (a monarchy), Nigeria, and India also experienced similar developments in literacy, education, and economic growth [01:42:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>, [01:43:32]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>, [01:43:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>, [01:46:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>, [01:46:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>, [01:47:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03">[01:47:03]</a>, [01:47:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>, [01:47:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:21">[01:47:21]</a>.

These developments are attributed to the "era," bringing new state understandings, increased state influence, advancements in transportation and communication, and a rising need for educated personnel [01:47:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>, [01:47:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>, [01:47:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>, [01:47:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. These are 20th-century phenomena observed globally [01:48:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>.

## Historical Context: Specific Events and Decisions

### Ankara as Capital
Ankara was not "created from nothing" as a capital [01:51:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:02">[01:51:02]</a>, [01:51:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. It was one of Central Anatolia's three largest cities (along with Kayseri and Konya) in the early 20th century, with a population of 40,000-50,000, and was probably the most developed [01:51:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:14">[01:51:14]</a>, [01:51:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:33">[01:51:33]</a>, [01:51:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>. Ankara is a very old city, a major Anatolian hub since the Roman period [01:51:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:41">[01:51:41]</a>. It had a modern, planned Armenian neighborhood (Keçören) founded in 1910, which was unique in Anatolia at the time [01:51:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>, [01:52:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>, [01:52:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>. Its economic assets from mohair exports and the arrival of the Anatolian railway in 1880 contributed to its development and likely its selection as the national struggle's headquarters [01:53:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:04">[01:53:04]</a>, [01:53:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:24">[01:53:24]</a>, [01:53:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:37">[01:53:37]</a>.

### The Greek War (1919-1922)
The 1919-1922 war between Greece and Turkey is considered by some to be an exaggerated "defeat" for Greece, especially given Turkey's larger population (four times that of Greece) and economy (three or four times larger) at the time [01:57:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a>, [01:58:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>. Turkey also had a long-standing military tradition, unlike Greece, which was relatively new to establishing an army [01:58:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>. The British and French allies were seen as having "driven the Greeks to the field," with the real concern for Turkey being the extent of British involvement [01:59:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>, [01:59:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:11">[01:59:11]</a>. The war is compared to the current Ukraine War, where Russia would clearly defeat Ukraine on its own, but external support complicates the outcome [01:59:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>. The British provided weapons and money to Greece for about 18 months but eventually cut off support when success wasn't achieved [01:01:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

Mustafa Kemal Pasha's political calculations were key to turning the Greek War into a grand pageant and national epic [01:02:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. He presented the Battle of the Commander-in-Chief as a personal success, using it for propaganda to lay the foundation for his [[political_history_of_turkey | political future]] and presidency [01:02:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, [01:02:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. The date of August 30, 1922, was thus strongly underlined as a great national epic [01:02:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

### The Dardanelles Campaign (Çanakkale)
In March 1915, the British-French allied navy attempted to cross the Dardanelles but failed [01:03:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. In April 1915, land forces were deployed to the Gallipoli peninsula in what was considered a "crazy project" born of extreme arrogance, attributed to Winston Churchill [01:03:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>, [01:04:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, [01:04:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. The aim was to capture Istanbul within 48 hours if they passed Çanakkale, thereby forcing the Ottoman Empire out of the war [01:04:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, [01:04:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Another unspoken concern was to prevent Russia from capturing Istanbul [01:05:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. Landing in Izmir was not considered a viable alternative due to the long road to Istanbul and logistical challenges [01:05:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. The Çanakkale offensive was an opportunistic move for a quick victory [01:06:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## Broader Reflections on Turkish History and Identity

### The 1990s in Turkey
Starting in the mid-1980s, the Özal movement dominated Turkey, promoting a form of "liberalism" that encouraged focusing on making money, enjoying life, and integrating with the world, with less emphasis on traditional values [01:21:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, [01:22:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. This period saw the rise of new cafes, restaurants, and consumption patterns in Istanbul, fostering an optimistic feeling of Turkey joining the European Union [01:23:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>, [01:23:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>, [01:23:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. There was a sense of overcoming ideological obsessions and expanding freedoms [01:23:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>, [01:23:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

However, the 1990s gradually descended into pessimism [01:24:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>. The Kurdish issue intensified around 1993, leading to a terror campaign, deportation policies, destruction of villages, and forced migrations in Eastern provinces [01:25:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>, [01:25:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>, [01:25:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>. Kurdish intellectuals were killed, and a period of terror and oppression re-emerged, with the military re-entering [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | political and social issues in Turkey]] with its full tyranny [01:25:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>, [01:25:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>, [01:25:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. This dark period continued to worsen, leading to the explosion of the existing political party system and the rise of the Justice and Development Party around 2000 [01:26:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>, [01:26:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>, [01:26:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:31">[01:26:31]</a>. The 1990s are summarized as "not a good period" [01:26:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

### Critiquing Official Historical Narratives
There is intense interest in niche historical areas, particularly concerning [[cultural_and_political_transformations_in_turkey_and_its_periphery | Cultural and Political Transformations in Turkey and its Periphery]] and [[changing_religious_and_cultural_dynamics_in_turkey | changing religious and cultural dynamics in Turkey]] [01:27:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. This stems from the fact that Turkey's official discourses on history and identity are filled with "stupid lies" [01:28:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>, [01:28:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. People feel a gap between what they learned from their grandparents and what they are taught in school, and they seek to resolve this contradiction [01:28:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>, [01:28:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

> "The entire education curriculum and official national ideology are based on denying these and squeezing them into the framework of a really stupid narrative, a myth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>

Behind the official narrative, there are human stories, ethnic and cultural divisions, clashes, and envy that represent the real history of the country [01:29:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>, [01:31:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. Discovering this truth, even at a local level, is considered a "revolutionary service" that shakes the official narrative of the Republic's ideology [01:31:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>, [01:31:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53">[01:31:53]</a>.

### Current Geopolitical Situation
There is a serious danger of war, with the speaker noting that Turkey likely does not want to get involved, sending clear messages to both sides (e.g., the President organizing a Palestine rally while Turkish warships participate in NATO fleets) [01:36:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>, [01:37:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">[01:37:59]</a>, [01:38:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>, [01:38:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. Turkey aims to play a role as a guarantor or patron in a new Palestinian order but faces challenges as the Arab world may not accept such a role [01:38:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:48">[01:38:48]</a>, [01:39:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>, [01:39:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

The 100th anniversary of the Republic prompts reflection on its actual significance [01:50:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. Presenting it as a critical historical turning point or a matter of "existence and non-existence" is not to be taken seriously [01:50:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:22">[01:50:22]</a>. While an important historical event that opened a new page in the [[historical_reflections_on_ottoman_empires_reforms_and_leadership | historical development]] of the Turkish state, the most important changes between the pre-1923 era and the Republic—the shift from a "Sovereign Nation" to a single nation and the expansion of educated public cadres—would likely have occurred regardless of the specific republican regime [01:48:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>, [01:48:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>, [01:49:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>, [01:49:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the 1920s and 30s was limited to a narrow segment and ultimately failed [01:49:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:24">[01:49:24]</a>, [01:49:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>, [01:49:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:47">[01:49:47]</a>.

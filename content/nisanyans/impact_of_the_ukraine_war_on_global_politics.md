## Current State of the Ukraine War

As of May 29th, 2023, the speaker asserts that Ukraine is defeated, with nothing left to discuss for those following the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. The Ukrainian army has exhausted its existence as a force capable of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

Key observations include:
*   Ukrainian President Zelensky has been abroad since May 2, for almost four weeks, while his country fights a war of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armies has been missing for two or three weeks; it was rumored he was injured in a North H airstrike, but his disappearance suggests a possible coup attempt and liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   Russia skillfully utilized a false attack narrative, leading Ukraine to mass troops in a specific area, where Russian forces "hunted them like they were catching flies," killing approximately 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers with insignificant Russian losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   Russia is increasingly deploying new and more powerful weapons, having destroyed Ukraine's infrastructure, leaving the country without electricity for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications and the Threat of World War

A definite and strong Russian victory in Ukraine, the speaker warns, will lead to a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. NATO cannot accept such a victory, as a clear defeat would mean the end of NATO and America's world hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Russia is currently holding back from a complete "collapse move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

### The Future of Ukraine

It is increasingly voiced that Ukraine will most likely cease to exist as a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
*   The previous Russian view involved taking the eastern provinces and establishing one or two smaller Ukrainian states, such as a neutral, impartial Kiev Republic, with a Western-allied Ukraine remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
*   Currently, discussions suggest that Western Ukraine will be given to Poland, with parts potentially going to Hungary and Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This aligns with Poland's long-held dream of reclaiming Western Ukraine, which they consider their historical lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   A possible Russian bargaining chip could be to offer Poland half of Ukraine in exchange for Poland leaving NATO, aiming for two friendly, neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Escalation and New Fronts

The speaker believes that the Americans will escalate the war before giving such a peace proposal a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. Several potential new fronts for conflict are identified:
*   A very hot conflict is possible between Kosovo and Serbia, with a growing potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   Provocations could easily start a war in the three Baltic republics on the border of Finland and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   An [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Iran war]] is described as a "mind-boggling incident," likely to be struck from an unexpected place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.

### Economic and Global Power Shifts

The United States Congress's decision to grant the American government unlimited borrowing until January 1, 2025, effectively allowing unlimited money printing, is seen as a policy of "sinking fish and going sideways," a desperate move to avert immediate collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

Turkey's ability to stay out of the upcoming war would be a significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. While Turkey is expected to face severe economic collapse, comparable to Lebanon or Sri Lanka, it can overcome this as long as it avoids being dragged into war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Therefore, when evaluating political messages, it is crucial to ask whether they bring the country closer to or further from war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

The safest place in this potential global conflict is likely China, or potentially Central Asia and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

## Global Governance and Power Structures

The speaker states that "states, especially Western states, regimes that bear the name of democracy, have been completely taken over by intelligence organizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. These intelligence and police organizations, like the CIA, have gained unprecedented power, intertwined with large financial institutions, investment funds, and gigantic technology companies that control information flow and manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. The pharmaceutical industry has also gained abnormal financial power in the last 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

These elements collectively "rule the Western world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>, and where they cannot manage, they declare war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. This is presented as a simple fact, rather than a conspiracy of secret societies like the Illuminati or Rockefellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. These "official institutions," established by law and commerce, are governing the Western world and "messed up and ruined it" because they are not as smart as they think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

The historical fabric of [[examination_of_ethnic_and_cultural_identity_in_turkey | Turkish]] society, particularly in Anatolia, has been significantly shaped by the presence and interactions of various nomadic and semi-nomadic communities, notably the Yörüks and Turkmens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. These groups, while often seen as distinct, shared complex [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics]] that influenced the [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural and ethnic landscape]] of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.

## Yörüks: Nomadic Turkish-Speaking Communities

Yörüks are defined as nomadic Turkish-speaking tribal communities who traditionally inhabited the older territories of the Ottoman state, predating 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. They were particularly prevalent across the entire Aegean Region and the area extending from Konya to Karaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

Their lifestyle, maintained until the 20th century, involved living in villages during winter and migrating to plateaus with their animals in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. Although their ultimate origins are not widely known, they identify themselves as Turks and speak the Turkish language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This aspect contributes to the [[cultural_and_historical_background_of_turkish_yrk_tribes | cultural and historical background of Turkish Yörük tribes]].

## Turkmen: Migratory Groups and Their Identity

Turkmens refer to groups that undertook large-scale migrations from the eastern provinces starting in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. These migrations originated primarily from regions such as the Dulkadiroğlu principality (Maraş) and the Aleppo province, extending south to Mosul, Kirkuk, Aleppo, Maraş, and Antep, moving westward and northward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. They were often referred to as Akkoyunlu in Ottoman terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

While their common language was Turkish, it is evident that these migrating Turkmen groups were ethnically mixed, including Arabs, Kurds, and even Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Due to being under the sovereignty of Turkish tribal organizations, these diverse elements were largely Turkified and considered Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. This phenomenon highlights [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | historical narratives on Turkish and regional identities, including the origins of certain ethnic groups]].

## Historical Conflict and Evolution

The arrival of Turkmens in Western Anatolia and the Aegean region, as a mixed group, naturally led to conflict with the local population, including the Yörüks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. The Yörük-Turkmen distinction was a source of fierce contention until a couple of generations ago, representing two different kinds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This contrast, based on one group being older inhabitants and the other arriving later, characterizes the Aegean Region and the western parts of Central Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

Interestingly, while Turkmen migration continued under a Turkish identity until the early 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>, from the 17th century onwards, subsequent migrations in the same regions increasingly involved Kurdish confederations, shifting the center of gravity from Turks to Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. These later Kurdish groups primarily settled in areas like the Konya plain, Cihanbeyli, Kulu, Haymana, Kırşehir, and Çorum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. This demonstrates the [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | ethnic and cultural changes in Eastern Anatolia over time]].

Over time, this distinction has gradually faded, with both Yörüks and Turkmens becoming assimilated into the broader [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Turkish average]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. The emergence of new elements, such as Rumelian immigrants in the early Republic period and Kurdish immigration since 1990, pushed the Yörük-Turkmen conflict into the background, leading to a realization of shared identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

### Continuous Migration in Turkey
Throughout Turkey's history, there has been a continuous pattern of migration from the southeast and east towards the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. This ongoing demographic shift further illustrates the dynamic nature of [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | ethnic group interactions]] and formation in Turkey.

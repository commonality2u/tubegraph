From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The history of modernization is characterized by the shift of power from an otherworldly, divine source to worldly, human authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This transition implies that sovereignty, once believed to descend from the heavens, has since come down to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Historical Context of Divine Law

Historically, laws were perceived as being set by a divine power, originating from the sky or God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This perspective suggests that human laws were once considered to be directly decreed by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. For example, the Ottoman legal code, Mecelle, was rooted in Islamic jurisprudence (`fiqh`), undeniably drawing from a divine source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This meant its foundations were theocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Lawmakers and enforcers in the past often concluded that the source of law was divine, based on sacred texts, or at least defended this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The ideological justification for the laws people implemented was rooted in a divine discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

The old, religion-based legal system possessed both advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Its primary advantage was that the making and interpretation of laws were outside the direct control of the state's head of state's executive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Laws were upheld by the myth that they were created by a sacred authority at a specific point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Interpretation of these laws was exclusively the domain of scholars (`Ulema`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## The Shift to Secular Law

With [[modernization_and_secularism_in_turkish_history | modernization]], societies began to shift towards human-made laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. In Europe, with Napoleon, and in Türkiye, with Atatürk, the divine basis of law was abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The new understanding was that humans could create laws and abolish them as needed, without needing to rely on any external authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

This shift presented a paradox: if laws were once seen as divine, how could they now be solely human creations? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> A [[secularism_and_freedom_of_expression_in_religion | secular perspective]] acknowledges that all laws, even those from a so-called theocratic order, are ultimately made by human hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. People, through conflict and compromise, arrange these laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Criticisms of Secular Law

Thinkers from the 19th and 20th centuries strongly opposed the idea that people could freely make all kinds of laws based on contemporary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. They warned that this path was "troublesome" and would not lead to a good outcome, as it granted too much authority to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

A major concern was that law could become solely dependent on the whims of bureaucrats who seized state authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. It was argued that in civilized countries, every new law tends to increase the power and authority of the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, making the administration of society dependent on bureaucratic interests and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Criticisms of Religion-Based Law

The transition to [[secularism_and_freedom_of_expression_in_religion | secularism]] was not arbitrary; it was driven by legitimate criticisms against religion-based legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

A primary issue was that the old legal system, particularly `fiqh` (Islamic jurisprudence), was highly suited to the needs, culture, habits, and political balances of the Abbasid state in the 8th and 9th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. However, it failed to adapt to the different world of the 19th and 20th centuries, as its sanctified nature made change difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Any attempt to modify it was often accused of being irreligious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, leading many to conclude that it was better to discard the entire system and rewrite laws from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

Another criticism revolved around the [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | interpretation of religious texts]] and laws. Despite the declaration that the "door of Ijtihad" (independent reasoning in Islamic law) was closed centuries ago, legal scholars developed sophisticated arguments to circumvent existing laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. This ultimately transformed the law into an "inextricable labyrinth" or "gallery of mirrors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. By the 19th century, Islamic and Ottoman intellectuals accused Sharia of lacking a tangible infrastructure that a simple person could grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. The complexity meant it was no longer possible to understand what the rule of law was on any given subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This led to "endless corruption, endless uncertainty, and legal processes sinking into an inextricable swamp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Consequently, there was a call to establish a rational, simple legal system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Religion's [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | Role and Perception in Society]]

The perception of religion's [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | role in society]] has evolved. For several centuries, Islam was seen as a great source of Ottoman power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a> and its main engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. However, from the mid-17th century onwards, as Europe developed and the Islamic world lagged, Islam became a significant hindrance to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. Its inability to overcome this hindrance contributed to centuries of impoverishment, military defeat, loss of land, and [[cultural_and_societal_influences_in_history_and_modernday_politics | social disintegration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

The idea that a society needs "faith" is accepted, though this is interpreted broadly as a social goal or a collective feeling of trust in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:15">[01:43:15]</a>. However, the traditional, "old-fashioned" forms of faith, such as old-style Christianity or Islam, are seen as no longer valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:22">[01:43:22]</a>.

### Persecution of Religious Communities

Christian communities in Syria, a part of historical Syria, have faced significant persecution and even massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This makes the free celebration of Christmas mass by the Greek Orthodox community of Antakya, in what is claimed to be the world's first church (St. Peter's Cave Church), a welcome event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Allegations of the World's Oldest Church

The St. Peter's Cave Church in Antakya is considered the oldest church in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, a claim dismissed as "empty nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. While Antakya is historically important for Christianity, as the first Christian community settled there after being exiled from Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, and the name "Christian" was first pronounced there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, there's no evidence of early Christian persecution that would necessitate meeting in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The "invention" of the cave church as St. Peter's Church dates to after the Crusader invasion in 1098 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The Crusaders, needing a divine sign to legitimize their illegitimate government in Antakya, claimed to find a hidden cross and presented the cave as the gathering place of the first Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This was a local legend until the 1860s, when France, aiming to expand the influence of the Catholic Church in the Middle East, repaired and ceremonially opened the church in 1863, declaring it the world's oldest and first church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. These actions are described as political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## [[development_and_influence_of_religious_institutions | Development and Influence of Religious Institutions]]

The Pavlikan sect, emerging in the 8th century in Western Armenia (around Sivas, Malatya, Erzincan), was active in the region that later became a center of Alevism in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. Supported by Arabs, they managed a rebellion in Sivas province, especially Divriği and Kangal, for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.

Information about the Pavlikans is limited and biased, primarily coming from Byzantine and Armenian historians who depicted them negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. There is no direct writing from the Pavlikans themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>. In the late 10th century, Emperor Johannes Sises suppressed them, exiling many to the Balkans (Bulgaria and Bosnia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

The capital of the Pavlikans was the town of Divriği <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>, a name derived from the Greek "tefriki," meaning sectarianism or separatists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>. The active area of the Pavlikans overlapping with a later center of Alevism in Türkiye is considered more than a coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>. It is realistic to believe that Sivas Alevis might have been influenced by Pavlikan traditions or continued their habits of objecting to the dominant state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

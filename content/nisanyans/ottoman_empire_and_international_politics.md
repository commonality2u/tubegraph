The study of the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts|Ottoman Empire]] and its international relations, particularly during the reign of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, reveals a complex web of diplomacy, war, and political maneuvering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Obtaining an objective understanding of this period is challenging due to the nature of historical sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Challenges in Historical Interpretation

Information about rulers and state administrators, such as Fatih Sultan Mehmet, often comes with stereotyped sentences and eulogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This applies to Roman emperors, Byzantine emperors, and Abbasid caliphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Historical narratives often aimed to portray a sultan as either a virtuous example or a condemned figure, depending on the author's agenda or contemporary political needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Turkish [[historical_discussions_on_ottoman_empire_reforms|Ottoman]] sources provide limited information on Fatih Sultan Mehmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Notable works include the history by Aşıkpaşazade and a history written shortly after Fatih Sultan Mehmet's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Later histories, such as those from the 1860s and 1870s, or works produced towards the end of Fatih's era (circa 1460s), are considered official histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. In these official histories, the attitude of Turkish historians towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet is described as "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Towards the end of his rule, he was not a beloved Sultan and was identified with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He particularly targeted the Turkish-Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, crushing their power, seizing property, and executing many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Fatih Sultan Mehmet's 30-year rule was characterized by "constant war," declaring war on a different place every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

More detailed insights often come from Byzantine historians like Chalkokondyles and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These individuals lived during Fatih's time, personally met him, and were familiar with the situation in his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, their writings also contained "political things" and agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Ottoman Diplomatic Engagements

The Ottoman Empire was not an isolated state; it was deeply embedded in [[international_relations_and_geopolitical_shifts_involving_turkey|international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. During Fatih Sultan Mehmet's era, the world politics were highly complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Relations with Italian States

Byzantine historians, particularly Chalkokondyles and Ducas, were often involved in political dealings between the Ottoman Empire and Italian states like Genoa and Venice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Their writings sought to defend specific Italian interests or to establish alliances and rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy, reflecting ulterior motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The Ottoman Empire maintained "intense relations with Italy and many imported states that are at war with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Contemporary accounts often compared Fatih Sultan Mehmet to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Claims that Fatih knew Latin and Italian, and was aware of Christianity, are examples of such comparisons, requiring historians to question *why* these statements were made rather than simply their veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Historians must always question the motives behind statements made about historical figures, recognizing that information about state leaders is often "released to the market through buffets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of such claims, even when directly interacting with the person in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

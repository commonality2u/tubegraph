This article explores various societal developments in Morocco, often contrasting them with observations made about [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]], drawing insights from a recent three-week trip.

## Modernity and Urbanization
A central theme of discussion was whether Morocco or [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]] is "more modern" and the definition of modernity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Modern City Parts:** The modern sections of Moroccan cities are described as "extremely Europe," clean, orderly, and contemporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Rabat, in particular, was highlighted as very green, orderly, and contemporary, offering all the conveniences and commercial services of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Cleanliness:** Morocco is noted as a cleaner country than [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]], Egypt, and Iran, suggesting efficient municipal services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Traditional Preservation vs. Urbanization:** Unlike [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]], Morocco has largely preserved its old cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Medina (old neighborhoods) in cities like Marrakesh are vast and untouched by modern structures, with new constructions blending seamlessly into the old style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Rural areas in the south maintain lifestyles from centuries ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   This suggests Morocco has "set foot in the 21st century less than [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, which could be interpreted as being "a few steps ahead" if one values preservation over rapid change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Political and Social Dynamics
### Monarchy vs. Republicanism
*   **King's Popularity:** Moroccans widely express love for their King, with slogans like "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (God, the Homeland, the King) prominently displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Photographs of the King are ubiquitous in businesses, government offices, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Social Equivalence to Kemalism:** An "astonishing social equivalence" was observed between radical loyalty to the King in Morocco and "fanatic Kemal Atatürkism" in [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This means that middle-class, modern, secular-leaning women in Morocco, who might be staunch Kemalists in [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]], are similarly fanatic about the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Legacy of French Rule
The 40-50 years of French rule in Morocco have left a considerable effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   French is widely spoken and used in official signs and offices, often superseding Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   This colonial legacy has resulted in a "European polish" while many traditional social orders remain preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Traditional Crafts and Economy
*   **Vibrant Crafts in Fez:** The Fez Bazaar (Medina) is described as a unique place globally, where manufacturing tradesmen actively work, preserving a "Middle Ages" atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Craftsmen in various trades (carpentry, tile-making, lamp-making, leatherwork) produce high-quality handmade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Decline of Crafts in [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]]:** In contrast, crafts are considered "dead" in [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. While places like Urfa, Bursa, and Edirne Bazaars exist, they primarily sell factory goods, lacking an original artisan tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Future of Moroccan Crafts:** Despite the current vibrancy, the average age of Moroccan craftsmen is over 50, with fewer young people entering these trades, suggesting the tradition might significantly weaken or die within 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Comparison of Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic
The discussion also delved into the societal changes brought by the Turkish Republic compared to the social order of the [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]].
*   **Republic's Achievement: Middle Class:** The Republic's major effort and success was creating a middle class of literate urbanites qualified for civil service or professions like lawyers, doctors, and accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This modernization project, starting in the 19th century, aimed to establish a Turkish Muslim middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
    *   Prior to this, the 19th-century modernization efforts in the [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] had created a non-Muslim middle class (Greeks, Armenians, Levantines, Assyrians), which was later eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Limited Impact on Lower Classes:** Until the 1960s, the Republic regime brought neither equality of opportunity nor prosperity to the large peasant and working-class segments outside this middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. Small improvements for these groups only began under leaders like Demirel, Özal, and Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.
*   **Failure in Elite Education:** The Republic's "unforgivable mistake" was failing to cultivate a ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. Elite education institutions were seen as enemies, and the regime feared and exiled individuals who thought "outside the limits," resulting in a society "with no heads, with cut heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.
*   **Overall Outcome:** Despite initial hopes, the Republic is argued to have not advanced the country relative to the rest of the world. Instead, it produced a "much more miserable, poor, untalented, uneducated, ignorant society" that is further behind globally than it was 100 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

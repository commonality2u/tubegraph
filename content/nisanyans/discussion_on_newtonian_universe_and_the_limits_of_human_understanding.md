A recurring question posed to the speaker concerns whether humanity lives in a "Newtonian universe" and if the universe is a purely mechanical system without unseeable dimensions in time and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Defining the "Newtonian Universe"
The speaker clarifies that the question about a "Newtonian universe" likely refers not merely to Isaac Newton's laws of physics, but to whether the world of objects and realities consists solely of objective relationships and cause-effect chains that leave no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that if one were to study these interactions long enough, perhaps with artificial intelligence, all rules of interaction could be perfectly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. This scientific thought assumes that physical, chemical, biological, sociological, and psychological rules can all be reduced to abstract cause-and-effect relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

### Newton's Own Beliefs
It's important to note that Isaac Newton himself was an "extremely religious person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. He was deeply engrossed in supernatural and unnatural events, writing many books and engaging in [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | discussions]] about topics like the apocalypse, the existence and necessity of God, and the meaning of prophecies in the Bible and Torah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. In the 18th century, it was improbable for a renowned scientist to be indifferent to religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. While this historical context is noted, the speaker does not personally agree with Newton's views on these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## The Limits of Human Understanding
The core of the question, as interpreted, asks whether the world possesses dimensions beyond human grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that there are "definitely many concepts that we cannot grasp, that we do not know, that we do not understand, that we cannot solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Two Possibilities for the Unknown
1.  **Knowable but Not Yet Known**: This information, including that beyond the physical world, is something humans can eventually understand and learn through research and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
2.  **Inherently Unknowable**: Some phenomena "we will never understand" because they exist outside our universe of vision, perception, and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Examples include the beginning and outer limits of the universe, and the fundamental nature of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. For these, the only honest answer is: "We do not know, we do not understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Critique of Religious Explanations for the Unknown
The speaker criticizes a common "trick" used by those who seek to explain the universe through religion or holy teachings: when faced with the unknown, they attribute it to an abstract entity like a god or mythical being (e.g., "the rainbow dragon created the world," "Zeus created the world") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This, the speaker argues, merely elevates ignorance to a name and doesn't genuinely explain anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. Instead of admitting ignorance, they claim to know, but when pressed for an explanation of their divine entity, they ultimately return to "we do not know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

Such an approach stems from an inability to accept that some things are or may remain unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. The speaker finds this reliance on "magical" explanations to be a "childish love of fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>, emphasizing that "knowledge cannot come from ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## The "I" (Consciousness) as a Non-Newtonian Reality
The speaker posits that the world is **not** solely made up of objective cause-and-effect relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. There is a "completely different giant reality outside that crowded objective world, even a reality that is bigger than it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>: **consciousness**, or the "I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

This consciousness is not exclusive to humans; it is present in all living beings to varying degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, including lizards, flies, and cats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This "I" enters the objective world as a "giant dark point," a "negative pole," an "area of the unknown" that "swallows the whole universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. It is a "ball of uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a> and a "black hole" of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.

Key characteristics of this "I" that transcend the Newtonian field:
*   **[[concept_and_misconceptions_of_free_will | Free Will]]**: The fundamental truth of human psychology is the ability to make choices independently, such as waving one's hand left or right, with only the self deciding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. This represents a being that is the antithesis of cause-and-effect relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   **Imagination**: The capacity to conceive of the non-existent, to think of things not present or not real, and even to speak lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. This is a profound intervention in the universe, entirely outside the Newtonian field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.
*   **Perception of Past and Future**: The ability to remember past events and predict future ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. The world of objects exists only "at the moment," in an "eternal Present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. The human capacity to deny and even destroy what exists through thought about other times transcends this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Significance
These insights represent the "first and basic steps of [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | philosophical thought]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. Grasping this dilemma can lead to significant enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>. Since thinkers like Descartes, Heidegger, and Sartre, this tension between the world of laws and the paradoxical existence of the self has been a basic subject of Western [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. The individual, a "zero dimension, zero point" within the universe of laws, is simultaneously a "great paradox" that is "bigger than the whole universe," and, in the speaker's personal opinion, "impossible to comprehend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Non-Newtonian Universe
Based on the existence and nature of consciousness, the speaker concludes that "we do not live in a non-Newtonian universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. Newton and the objective world exist, but the "inside" (consciousness) is "more important," an "elsewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

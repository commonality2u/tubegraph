A project is underway to create a compilation book from the content of the Sunday chats (Pazar Sohbeti Chat) and Samos exiles discussions, initiated at the suggestion of the publishing house. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> The speaker noted that there have been 185 such [[reflection_on_200th_pazar_sohbeti_chat | Sunday chats]] recorded so far. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

## Content and Scope
The compilation process involves an "incredible amount of material." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> Approximately half of the raw material is discarded, while the remainder is corrected, summarized, and shortened. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> Despite these efforts, the compiled work is projected to span 8 to 9 volumes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

## Progress
The speaker recently finished translating an application dictionary, which was a previous project, before starting on this compilation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> For a week or ten days, the speaker has been listening to the audio content with Ira, indicating ongoing work on the project. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> The speaker anticipates dedicating more time to this task. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

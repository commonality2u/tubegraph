The speaker asserts that the world population should be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, noting that wars are not effective in achieving this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. He suggests that technical methods for population reduction exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, but the primary challenge lies in deciding upon and implementing these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. There is a perceived effort to reduce the global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

## Demographic Trends in Western Countries

In [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western countries]], a significant decline in fertility rates has been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. This is partly attributed to the decline of the marriage institution, which naturally reduces the inclination to have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

The promotion and glorification of transsexuality and homosexuality are cited as factors leading to a substantial increase in individuals preferring homosexual relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. For instance, the speaker mentions figures around 20% for the United States today, contrasting with a historical norm of 2-3% in any society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

Other contributing factors to a radical population decrease in [[western_cultural_history_and_modern_challenges | Western society]], particularly among educated segments, include:
*   Prioritizing career, profession, and financial gain over marriage and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   The promotion of non-fertile sexuality types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   The approval of abortion as a birth control method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Challenges in Africa and South Asia

The speaker notes that the demographic approaches seen in Western countries are ineffective in Africa and South Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>, where the population growth rate is increasing by seven percent annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Gender Selection in India

A simpler method for population control, particularly in countries like India, is to inform families about the child's gender from the first week of pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. This, if implemented, could lead to a halving of the female population in India within a generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>, as the probability of female abortion is more than twice that of male child abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. While this would drastically reduce the overall population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, it also leads to different social dynamics:
*   The population decrease would be temporary, as it would quickly return to old levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
*   Men would begin to have more children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   The number of women would exceed that of men, potentially leading to polygamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   A reduction in the number of women yields entirely different results than a general population reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

French poet Arthur Rimbaud's death anniversary falls on November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He passed away on November 10, 1891, at the age of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Early Life and Poetic Genius

Rimbaud's first poems were written when he was 16 or 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Among these early works, "Le Bateau ivre" (The Drunken Boat) is considered one of the most extraordinary poems of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

His poetry introduced a "completely new sensitivity, a crazy sensitivity, a surreal sensitivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. What is particularly striking is that he managed to ground this innovative sensitivity on "extremely solid classical poetry discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, resulting in a "dizzying event" in literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The poem "A drunken ship" (referencing "Le Bateau ivre") is seen as a point where the "blind adventurism" of European culture, which is its defining feature of rejecting ties and desiring to conquer the world, breaks like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This breaking point, perhaps 20 or 30 years before World War I, allows one to "taste that feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The poem contains a "giant vision, an incredible vision and an unsustainable vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, where "the victory cry of European civilization is also an elegy of defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Life as a Vagabond and Trader

Rimbaud spent a significant part of his life as a vagabond, described as a "homosexual drug addict vagabond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. At some point, he decided this lifestyle no longer satisfied him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

He then moved to Yemen and subsequently migrated to the city of Harar in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In Harar, he engaged in coffee and arms trade, starting these ventures when he was 25 or 26 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The city of Harar itself is noted for representing "a different culture and a different past from the rest of Ethiopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Interestingly, it is said that the old native ruling class of Harar was of Turkish origin, stemming from Ottoman soldiers sent to Abyssinia in the 16th century (around 1535), who later settled in Harar after a defeat against the Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

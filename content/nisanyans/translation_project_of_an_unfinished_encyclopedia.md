The speaker is currently nearing the completion of a significant [[Translation Work and Challenges | translation work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[:50]</a>. This project involves translating an [[unfinished_works_and_encyclopedias | unfinished encyclopedia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[:10]</a>, which is described as a "very serious and comprehensive incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[:04]</a>.

## Project Details

The encyclopedia is approximately 1,000 pages long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[:00]</a>. A notable characteristic of the original work is its incomplete nature; it concludes abruptly at a certain letter of the alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[:20]</a>.

The speaker has become intimately familiar with the author and their sources, understanding precisely where the material was derived from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[:25]</a>. Despite this deep knowledge, the speaker has decided against completing the missing entries that the original author, who lived 120 years ago, was unable to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[:40]</a>. This decision is due to not wanting to dedicate another three years to the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[:52]</a>. However, there is a possibility of adding "certain items as far as I can find" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[:57]</a>.

## Personal Impact

The demanding nature of this large translation project has led the speaker to completely lose connection with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[:51]</a>. This includes significant detachment from personal life, such as not having met his son for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[:34]</a>, and neglecting calls to his mother, friends, and acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[:43]</a>. He describes this phase as having "completely lost my tolerance for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[:28]</a>. The project occupies his thoughts even before waking, as he begins to "do my job in my dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[:02]</a>.

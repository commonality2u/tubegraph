The [[trkiye_and_syria_earthquake_of_2023 | terrible earthquake]] that struck Türkiye and Syria is seen as a natural disaster of extraordinary dimensions for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Its magnitude is unprecedented, causing equal destruction along a line of 150-160 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The earthquake was felt from Damascus to Ankara, causing severe destruction in regions from central Syria to Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Immediate Impact on Population and Cities

Three provincial centers – Antakya, Maraş, and Adıyaman – were severely damaged by the earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These cities are expected to face significant challenges in recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The total population in the heavily damaged provinces, including Hatay, Maraş, and Adıyaman, is estimated to be between 3.5 million and 4 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Initial assessments indicate that 10-20% of houses in Antakya were completely reduced to rubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, with a higher rate of 30% mentioned for Maraş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In Adıyaman, it is reported that almost all buildings have been destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The situation in districts like Elbistan, Pazarcık, Kırıkhan, and Hassa remains largely unknown due to lack of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Given that the earthquake occurred at night when most people were at home, a modest destruction rate of 10% in the affected region could suggest a death toll of at least 300,000, potentially up to 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Antakya, Maraş, and Adıyaman are considered largely unlivable, with estimates suggesting that almost 90% of buildings in these areas are uninhabitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. Even buildings that remained standing are effectively uninhabitable due to the destruction of essential infrastructure like grocery stores, gas stations, banks, and workplaces, along with significant loss of life among residents' relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.

## Projected Internal Migration

The earthquake will undoubtedly lead to a significant internal migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This means the demographic structure of the region will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Millions of people are expected to migrate westward in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

The immediate migration is anticipated towards Adana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>, followed by large migrations to Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, and generally towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. Preventing this widespread migration is deemed difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

### Long-Term Demographic Shifts

Once the rubble is cleared and cities begin to rebuild, there will be a demand for construction workers, grocers, civil servants, and other professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. While the former residents may not return, new people might flock to these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

Considering Türkiye's demographic patterns, where there are high populations in areas like Urfa, Diyarbakır, Mardin, Muş, and Van, there is a possibility of a population gap in Maraş, Antep, and Hatay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This suggests that people from these more populated eastern and southeastern provinces might move into the earthquake-affected regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

Türkiye has experienced tremendous internal [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | migration]] for 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | internal migration]] has not only been from East to West but also from villages to cities, mountains to plains, and higher elevations to lower ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. All regional cities and towns have grown significantly and continue to do so at an accelerating pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Reversing this trend appears very challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## Impact on Specific Communities

### Jewish Community in Hatay

Hatay, particularly Antakya, has historically hosted a significant Jewish community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. While their population was around 200 people 20-30 years ago, it had recently dwindled to just 15 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. The community is now practically at an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. Their only synagogue, which was also the only one in Türkiye outside of Istanbul and Izmir, was completely destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. It is uncertain if it will be rebuilt or if the community will be able to continue its activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.

### Christian Arab Community in Altınözü

The Altınözü district of Hatay is home to a unique Christian Arab neighborhood, primarily Greek Orthodox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. They possess a beautiful church in the town's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>. The current situation in Altınözü after the earthquake remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

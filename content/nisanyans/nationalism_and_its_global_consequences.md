## The Decay of Western European States

Many Western European countries, such as England, France, Italy, and Spain, show signs of decay due to mismanagement and a corrupt political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. England is described as a "second-class state" clinging to memories of a past empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This mismanagement and the accumulation of negativities could lead to a social explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

A significant contributing factor is the unchecked influx of millions of foreigners into societies without establishing an ideological infrastructure or convincing the existing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This creates a huge cultural gap, making social explosions and conflicts based on race or native/immigrant status inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Breakdown of Social Cohesion
In these societies, there is no longer a common vision of being "one society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. People increasingly see each other as enemies due to differing cultures, languages, races, and living areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The "natives" (whites) might believe the state and army are on their side to reclaim their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, but financial powers often support the new immigrant class, viewing them as economically beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Furthermore, immigrants are often more accustomed to violence, having grown up in such environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This dynamic suggests a potential outcome similar to a "Islamic Republic of England" within a few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

This atmosphere in Western Europe and the United States of America is compared to the final decades of the Vara Empire in the 390s and 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, highlighting the cyclical nature of [[Rise and Fall of Empires and National Identity | empires and national identity]].

## The Challenge of Immigration in Turkey

Turkey faces a similar situation with millions of foreign elements injected into its society, leading to natural reactions and conflicts among locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Historically, large mass migrations have never been reversed; once people are in a country, they do not go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. It is considered "stupid" and "ignorant" to believe that millions of Syrians and Afghans will return after living in Turkey for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. These newcomers will inevitably become a part of Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

A realistic state policy should focus on calming the angered natives while simultaneously educating and integrating newcomers to live in harmony with societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. The education of new generations, specifically the children of these foreigners, is crucial to gradually eliminate this crisis over 10-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Nationalism as a Tool for Power

[[Nationalism and its impacts on society | Nationalism]] is fundamentally about local groups asserting their right to "rob" or control their country's resources instead of external powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This essence is observed in Turkey's early 20th century, other African countries, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. To achieve this, nationalist movements need allies: the army and the poor, proletarian class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Providing benefits like housing is a common tactic to gain the support of the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Venezuela
Venezuela exemplifies a "local bandit" rebelling against a "big bandit" (American companies) to control its own territory and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. The socialist claims of figures like Chavez and Maduro are dismissed as actions of "gangsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a> whose primary goal is to redirect the country's wealth for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

Venezuela, despite being oil-rich, experienced severe economic hardship after disrupting established economic structures and interest relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. This was due to ruthless economic measures implemented by the Americans and the collapse of the upper class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Similar patterns of economic collapse and eventual recovery were seen in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

## Kemalism as a Form of Nationalism

[[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Kemalism]] is understood as a policy of secularism, often manifesting as hostility towards traditional Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. Beyond this, its real content is doubtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. It's often summarized as "we are superior, we are strong, we will crush you," and "we are not bound by moral and legal rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>. This "Avan nationalism" shares similarities with hate speech seen in Israel today, where a group believes itself so right that it has no moral or conscientious duty towards its opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.

This mindset stems from either extreme ignorance or severe societal trauma and fear, as seen in Turkey between 1918-1919 when the society felt ruined and targeted by the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. For 110 years, Turkish leadership has successfully perpetuated this fear and trauma with an "idiotic hostility discourse," which is the summary of Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>. Its only "saving grace" for some is its opposition to conservative Islamic discourse, even if it's "meaningless, ineffective, and fruitless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>. This ideology is seen as condemning Turkey to a deepening cultural and civilizational crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Fascism and Truth-Worshippers

Fascists, whose worldviews are based on hatred and anger, often do not truly love their own society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>. True love for society involves dealing with concrete problems, improving lives, and striving for excellence in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>. Fascist ideologies, however, are rooted in a deep hatred towards their own society, seen in their disparaging approach to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>. This leads to an introverted, cult-like perspective that focuses on abstract details rather than real-world issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>.

"Truth-worshippers" are critical, questioning individuals who evaluate societal common acceptances against objective criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. While they are intellectuals and thought leaders, they cannot be societal leaders because leadership requires sharing and reflecting the society's feelings and judgments to mobilize millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>. A truth-worshipper like Voltaire, unlike a leader like Napoleon, would stop to question and admit mistakes, which is a strength for an intellectual but a weakness for a societal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

## Historical Concepts of Race and Language

### The "Aryan Race" Delusion
The concept of the "Aryan race" adopted by Germans in the 1930s is described as an "absurd crisis" where people suddenly believed in a non-existent imaginary concept, rebuilding their lives around it and setting aside moral and legal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[46:22:00]</a>. "Aryan" actually means "Iran" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28:00">[47:28:00]</a>.

The idea originated from the discovery of ancient sacred texts in Iran (Avesta) and India (Vedas), written in similar languages (Avestan and Sanskrit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:00">[47:34:00]</a>. In both traditions, the most noble and divine class was called "Aryas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:34:00">[48:34:00]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a distinguished "Aryan" class carried the common ancestor of Indo-Iranian languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>. Germans then falsely claimed to be the pure descendants of these Aryans, asserting that while Aryans in Iran and India mixed with native populations, those who came to German forests remained "pure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>. Genetic research, however, refutes this, showing that Indo-European languages likely spread from south Russia or the Caucasus, not Scandinavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>. The German claim of being pure Aryans is "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:00">[51:48:00]</a>; like all races, they are a terribly mixed group that came under the rule of an Indo-European speaking class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>.

### Kurdish and Persian Languages
Kurdish is not a dialect of Persian, but a language related to Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:45:00">[52:45:00]</a>. The origin of Kurdish languages is linked to the Iranian language of Western Iran (Tabriz, Kermanshah, Hamadan region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:12:00">[53:12:00]</a>. In the 12th-13th centuries, Kurdish languages were strongly influenced by Persian, which was the *lingua franca* and dominant literary/state language of the Near East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:46:00">[53:46:00]</a>. Thus, Kurdish has a strong Iranian infrastructure with a thick layer of words borrowed from Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>. Zazaki is a separate language from Kurmanji Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>. The distinction between a language and a dialect is fluid, but generally, if speakers of complete, grammatically correct sentences cannot understand each other, they are speaking different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>.

### Pomaks and Turkishness
Pomaks are a group whose mother tongue is Bulgarian but who converted to Islam long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:01:00">[58:01:00]</a>. They primarily live in mountain regions, such as the Rhodope Mountains in southern Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:07:00">[58:07:00]</a>. Historically, they united their fate with Turks and intermarried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:53:00">[58:53:00]</a>. Urban Pomaks, like urban Kurds, often assimilate into the dominant Turkish culture within two generations by learning Turkish and adopting Ottoman Muslim civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Therefore, pre-Balkan War migration, "Pomaks" largely referred to villagers, as urban Pomaks had already become Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This illustrates how [[The Role of Language in National Identity | language plays a role in national identity]].

## The Armenian Presence in Jerusalem

Jerusalem has a long-standing Armenian population and church institution, dating back at least to the Crusader period (11th-12th centuries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. The Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem is an important institution with influence across the Armenian world, engaged in educational and publishing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

The old city of Jerusalem, as known today, is an Ottoman structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent in the 1530s, a new Jerusalem was established and divided into four neighborhoods based on typical Ottoman urban planning: Muslim, Greek (Orthodox Christian), Armenian, and Jewish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. The Armenian neighborhood is characterized as a labyrinth of intertwined courtyards, squares, churches, monasteries, and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. While historically significant, few Armenians beyond the church institution reside there today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. The Armenian neighborhood is currently under threat from the State of Israel and capital groups attempting to take over parts of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>.

## Morality, Reason, and Belief

### Innate Morality
Human beings are mammals with highly developed species behaviors that have evolved over millions of years, including innate "factory settings" for moral judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. Basic moral judgments about what is right and wrong have been consistent across all societies and historical periods, from primitive tribes to empires and modern nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. Behaviors like protecting children, forming alliances, and trusting others are deeply ingrained and essential for human survival and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. Betraying trust, for example, has universally been considered a terribly bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. These moral instincts are not learned conventions or agreements but inherent biological necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.

### The Role of Belief vs. Knowledge
Belief is defined as a weaker form of knowledge, steeped in subjectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. When one says "I believe," they are admitting they don't *know*; they are guessing or desiring something to be true because their knowledge is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>. Knowledge, on the other hand, implies objective certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

Belief becomes more necessary when attempting "impossible" things because knowledge limits people, teaching them when actions are unsupported or unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. If something is truly impossible, it means we don't know how to do it normally, thus necessitating a reliance on belief to "jump into the darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. Belief is often a stronger source of power in society than reason, as it allows for actions in unknown territories where knowledge falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>.

## Protecting One's Honor

The basic moral duty of a person is to protect their honor, considering it a value above all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. This principle, when internalized as an instinct, helps navigate many problems. However, the short-term and long-term strategies for protecting honor can conflict; immediate action might cause harm, while patience could lead to a more rational and comprehensive defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>. Compromising one's honor is seen as deserving of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>.

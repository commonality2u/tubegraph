From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

War is inherently an immoral phenomenon, a period during which society's measures of conscience and moral criteria, such as "behavior befitting a human being" or "right or wrong," are eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a>. In wartime, people often turn into animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Moral Impasses in War
War is intertwined with fundamental moral impasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>:
*   If one side does not kill, the other side will kill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   To shorten a war, massive destruction of the opposing side might be deemed necessary; otherwise, the conflict prolongs, leading to more deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   An escalation of savagery can be observed, stemming from the overflow of irrational hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## The Atomic Bombings of Japan
The speaker discusses [[the_ethics_and_implications_of_the_atomic_bomb | the atomic bomb]], raising [[philosophical_and_ethical_considerations | philosophical and ethical considerations]] about its use and the political responsibility of scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Initial Justification
The decision to drop two atomic bombs on Japan during [[nns_stance_during_world_war_ii | World War II]] was a terrible one, but the speaker believes it is not right to weigh it against the moral value judgments of normal peacetime life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The American argument for using the atomic bomb was that Japan had no intention of surrendering despite being defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Therefore, landing on the Japanese main islands to end the war would result in many more Japanese and American soldier deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. The atomic bomb was seen as the quickest method to end the war, and Japan did surrender after the bombs were detonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. From this perspective, the dropping of the bomb could be viewed as a "peace initiative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

### Additional Political Reasons
The Oppenheimer movie helps to clarify two additional reasons for dropping the bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>:
1.  **To intimidate the Soviet Union:** While allies during the war, America and the Soviet Union were expected to confront each other afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. The Soviets had released their armies in the west after April 1945 and were sending them east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Americans, having fought Japan for two years and broken their Pacific dominance, anticipated that the Russians would demand a share of the post-war spoils in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The Soviets had already occupied some of Japan's northern Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The immediate Japanese surrender to the Americans prevented the Soviets from further involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
2.  **To showcase the massive investment:** The American nuclear bomb development involved an incredible investment, theoretically proposed in 1938-1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. They established a research city, mobilized leading physicists and chemists, and recruited people from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. The bomb was only completed at the end of the war, too late for its initial target, Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. The desire to demonstrate this immense effort and the resulting unique weapon, which no other nation possessed, was a "lust" to show the fruits of their labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. This vision was one of global domination, where the United States would rule the world with a weapon capable of destroying humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. The capacity of such a weapon, they believed, could not be explained in words; it had to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Oppenheimer's Role and Regret
The speaker finds the Oppenheimer movie well-explained and successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. Oppenheimer is depicted as an extraordinarily intelligent yet flawed individual with sociopathic characteristics, struggling to adapt to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. Like many German-origin intellectuals of the 1930s, he had socialist and Marxist tendencies, with past connections to the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Despite this, he strongly advocated for dropping the bomb in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. However, after the war, he deeply regretted his stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a> and was subsequently "crushed like a bug" by the American state when he tried to challenge its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

## Societal Morality and Faith
The discussion touches upon a [[philosophical_discussion_on_morality | philosophical discussion on morality]] and [[reflections_on_writing_and_philosophical_thoughts_on_morality_and_holy_texts | holy texts]]. There's a perception that increasingly conservative and religious people are now openly criticizing Islam and its contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that Christian Protestantism was a Salafist movement, an attempt to return to Christianity's original state, and was bigoted from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:06]</a>. If one seeks a Protestantism in Islam, they should look at the Salafis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that religious imposition, observed in the last 20 years, leads to the weakening of Islam as a religion due to public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Sociological changes and shifts in lifestyles inevitably weaken religious ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Faith, in this view, is a byproduct of religious practice; if one grows up surrounded by religious customs, faith comes naturally, and people tend to follow the crowd without much [[unquestioning_faith_and_morality | unquestioning faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, when society moves away from these customs and life rhythms are determined by another world, individuals may question their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Major religions like Christianity and Islam seem to struggle to adapt to contemporary attacks and new realities, risking irrelevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Modern Day Dictatorship in US Politics
The speaker analyzes the situation in the US regarding the Republican Party chairman, an 80-something-year-old who froze during a press conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This raises questions about public tolerance in a country perceived as an "ideal democracy model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that when a system is divided between "two show parks," it does not become less of a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Since 2001, the US regime is best described as a serious dictatorship where the system is blocked, and people know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The example of President Biden's son's alleged corruption is cited, with the speaker claiming that nothing will happen to him or his father unless the regime changes, implying a "gang rules the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Conspiracy Theories and Authority
The existence of conspiracy theories is inversely proportional to trust in authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. When trust in authority is shaken, people go into "extra Turbo mode" to produce theories, seeking the truth when they suspect they are being lied to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This effort to discover secrets instead of blindly submitting to authority is seen as healthy and good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Questioning authority, especially when faced with perceived nonsense, is an honorable, intelligent, and ethical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. The term "conspiracy theory" is seen as a threat used by authorities to denigrate this effort to understand, akin to labeling questioners as "crazy" or "heretics" in past regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. People who try to dismiss arguments by calling them "conspiracy theories" are deemed unreliable and a social threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## The Gulf Stream and Doomsday Scenarios
The speaker discusses a theory about the Gulf Stream's collapse leading to a new ice age, noting that this theory predates the global warming discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. The Gulf Stream is a warm water current in the North Atlantic that makes the region habitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. The theory suggests that if North Pole ice melts and covers the Atlantic with cold water, the current could collapse and sink, causing a sudden cooling of the northern hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. The speaker finds the scenario interesting but views such modeling as no different from "reading coffee grounds," arguing that it relies on too many assumptions and creates scenarios without real predictive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. Modern popular science, it is argued, has replaced scientific activity with modeling, presenting these models as facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

The idea of humanity living its "last century" is a long-standing manipulation tactic used by those who control social psychology and dominant groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This "end of the world" speculation serves two purposes:
1.  **Permission for indulgence:** If the world is ending, many otherwise forbidden actions become permissible, leading to a desire for "crazy fun" and no responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.
2.  **Call to repentance:** Alternatively, it can prompt a call to repent and act morally to ensure a "clean" end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

The speaker advises against accepting such narratives, suggesting a healthier perspective is to always ask "What can I do to make this world a better place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.

## Hostility Towards Arabs in Turkey
Hostility towards Arabs in Turkey began in the mid-19th century, characterized as a "Turkish national behavior" starting with the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. At its core, this animosity stemmed from the Ottoman Turks' desire to align themselves with the West by distinguishing themselves from Arabs, whom they viewed as "insects" or "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. This sentiment intensified as Istanbul-educated bureaucrats began to govern Arab provinces, developing an immediate dislike for Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

An example is Ahmet Izzet Pasha, an Albanian aristocrat and military commander during the Yemen war (pre-WWI), who appreciated Western classical music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. He and his officers, including Ismet Inönü, listened to classical music records seized from British headquarters, reflecting a cultural alignment with the British despite fighting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>. This demonstrated a cultural affinity with the West and a rejection of Arab culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. The speaker asserts that the current hostility towards Syrians in Turkey is also rooted in this complex: "we are not them, they are inferior, we are racism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>.

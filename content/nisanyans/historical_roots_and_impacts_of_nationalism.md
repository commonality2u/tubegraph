[[Nationalism and its impacts on society | Nationalism]] is described as a "social disease" that has spread contagiously across humanity for 200 years, likened to a pandemic for which a vaccine has not yet been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

## The Invention of Nations
Nations are not inherent entities but are "invented" constructs, akin to narratives or tales passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This process involves creating "nice-sounding stories" that establish a common identity and spirit for millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:29">[02:02:29]</a>. These stories typically include a legendary founding ancestor, elaborate tales of heroism in war, and descriptions of the nation's characteristics and merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. Such narratives form a "big mythological sphere" that people find comforting to inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Nationalism's Combination with the State
The true problem arises when this national identity is combined with the concept of the state and the ideology that only one nation can exist within a specific geographical area under a single state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. This ideological fusion escalates matters significantly, leading to serious consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.

## [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Nationalism in Turkey]]
### Ottoman Society and Republican Transition
Ottoman society was characterized by its multinational nature, encompassing various nations and religions living side-by-side under the Empire's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. The Republic, in contrast, asserted itself as the state of only one of these societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This new nationalistic paradigm presented other groups with two stark choices:
*   Leave the country, often with measures taken to make their lives miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
*   Deny their original [[historical_perspectives_on_nationalism_and_identity | identity]] and assimilate into the "one and only Turkish nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

Initially, this assimilation seemed plausible, especially given the trauma the country had experienced and the desire for unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. Non-Muslims were suppressed, and Kurds were largely in the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### The Motto "How happy is the one who says I am a Turk"
The slogan "How happy is the one who says I am a Turk" was reportedly intended to uplift the status of the Anatolian people, who had been "exploited by the Palace administration for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. However, this slogan inherently carries disrespect towards other peoples by promoting an exclusionary national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

### Shifting Dynamics and Declining Efficacy
Over time, as Kurds descended from the mountains and non-Muslims reached a saturation point, the effectiveness of the assimilationist formula waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. The slogan "How lucky is the one who says I am a Turk" eventually "stopped working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## [[Nationalism and its global consequences | Global Consequences of Nationalism]]
The speaker notes that "all nations go through these processes in order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. If one group, like the Kurds, were to achieve their state through this "absurd thought system," another group, like the Zazas, would likely enter the same cycle years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

### The Role of Tribes and State Weakness
The presence of tribal structures is explained as a "Proto-state structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a> that emerges when the central state is weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. Tribes fulfill state functions like collecting tribute and providing protection (a "mafia logic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. This phenomenon is observed globally in areas geographically distant from central state authority, such as Scotland in the UK or Corsica in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. In [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | Turkey]], west of the Euphrates, a bureaucratic central administration existed since the Byzantine period, which the Ottomans adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. East of the Euphrates, however, the state lacked administrative staff and influence, leading to chaotic governance by various Armenian, Georgian, and Kurdish elements who formed their own political organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

### Democracy and Disobedience
The speaker controversially suggests that a "democratic culture" is more likely to flourish in the East of [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Turkey]] rather than the West, due to the Easterners' historical defiance against authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. Westerners are seen as timid and accustomed to bowing down to authority, while Easterners have not bowed down for 2000 years, a characteristic described as "explosive material" that can lead to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. Free-spirited individuals are more likely to be found east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.

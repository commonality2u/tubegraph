The exact number of [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevis]] in Turkey is not clearly known, with figures ranging from 8 million to 10 million being mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Alevi Communities

Within Turkey, several distinct [[differences_between_various_alevi_communities | Alevi communities]] are identified:

*   **Anatolian Turks** Approximately 4 to 4.5 million [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevis]] are defined as Turks in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Zazas** There is slight evidence suggesting that Zazas were Turks in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Hatay Arab Alevis (Nusayris)** A significant community located in the south, particularly Hatay. These Nusayris maintain a more radical line in terms of [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism beliefs]] compared to other Alevi groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Thracian Alevis** Found in Thrace, some [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevis]] are of [[albanian_immigration_patterns_in_turkey | Albanian origin]], potentially stemming from Southern Albania and having connections to Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Most people in this region have a line inclined to [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Tahtacılar** An element in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions whose origins are completely unknown, though they speak Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A French researcher concluded that the Tahtacılar are an element that existed before the Turks arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical Context and Formation of Alevism

[[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevism]] is characterized as a "rebellion movement" that emerged across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria at the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It is described as a tremendous uprising in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

This movement became a shelter for those who opposed or wished to distance themselves from traditional Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Various [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | ethnic groups]] and communities joined this uprising:

*   **Old Turkmen Elements** These [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | Turkmen elements]] had been in constant rebellion since the 13th century, frequently rebelling, refusing to pay taxes to the state, and not bowing to state teachers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Kurds** A large proportion of [[history_and_impact_of_alevi_kurdish_society | Kurds]] joined the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Armenians and Armenian Converts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Nusayris and Arab Christians** The Nusayris, described as having nothing to do with Islam, and many Christian converts from the coastal parts of Syria, including old Arab Christians, found this new model suitable and declared themselves [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The consistent oppression, massacres, bans, and raids by the state against this movement led to the integration of its members in a defensive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This environment fostered the formation of secret codes, solidarity organizations, and a distinct [[cultural_evolution_of_alevi_society | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Rejection of Ancient Turkish Origins

The claim that [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevism]] is an interpretation of old Turkish beliefs is explicitly dismissed as fraud and having nothing to do with ancient Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
The attempt to connect [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevism]] to ancient Turks is described as a "mental pathology" formed due to not feeling like a part of the Muslim ummah, fear of Sunnis, and hostile feelings towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In this context, Turkism is clung to as an alternative and a "shelter," forming an "ugly ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

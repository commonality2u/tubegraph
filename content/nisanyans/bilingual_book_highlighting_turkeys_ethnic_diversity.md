*Eastern Türkiye: A Trip* is a notable bilingual book, published in 2006, that explores the historical and contemporary ethnic and cultural landscape of Eastern Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The book is considered one of the author's favorites and was written with great pleasure over six years of intensive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Unique Bilingual Approach

The book is presented in both Turkish and English, but uniquely, the two versions are not direct translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Instead, they are described as "two different books with two different approaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This deliberate distinction stems from the understanding that the author is addressing "two different groups of people," each with varying prejudices and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The aim was to discuss a "troublesome subject like Eastern Türkiye" without causing undue disturbance or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!note] Author's Intent
> The author's goal was to convey a middle ground perspective, urging readers to see a shared reality rather than clinging to their pre-existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Extensive Field Research

The book's insights are based on extensive travels throughout Eastern Turkey over a six-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The author visited numerous locations, including all villages of Ardahan and scrutinized all districts and villages of Hakkari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This intensive fieldwork covered areas like Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and the northern parts of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The author engaged with a wide range of individuals, from villagers to cultured residents, and even local authorities like gendarmerie and police commanders, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Historical Ethnic Structure

Through this research, the author clearly perceived the historical [[examination_of_ethnic_and_cultural_identity_in_turkey | ethnic and cultural structure of the country]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Pre-20th Century Demographics

Until the early 20th century, major cities in Eastern Anatolia were predominantly inhabited by Turkish-speaking populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Van:** In the 1910s, there was "no trace of Kurds" in the center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır:** The center of Diyarbakır predominantly spoke Turkish, with major families identifying as Turkish, despite some Kurdish language usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Mardin:** The language of the city was Arabic, but ruling families considered themselves Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Ottoman Ruling Class and [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkish Identity]]

This demographic pattern was common throughout the Ottoman Empire, even in regions like the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The Ottoman ruling class was a cosmopolitan mix of many origins—Albanian, Georgian, Circassian, Dagestani, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. When individuals migrated to cities, gained an education, or integrated into the state mechanism, they "automatically become Turks" and began speaking Turkish, thus becoming part of [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkish society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The ultimate outcome of this mixture was identified as "Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Role of Non-Muslim Populations

Non-Muslims undertook nearly all urban services in these societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. At the beginning of the 20th century:
*   **Van:** About half of the city's population was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır:** More than half of the population was governed by Turks, with significant Armenian (20-30%) and Assyrian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Mardin:** The overwhelming majority was not Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The ruling class was Christian, and the city's language was Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

A notable observation was the extreme intertwining of Turkish and Armenian communities in city centers, with "almost all of these Turkish families have Armenians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. It was common to find an Armenian grandmother or great-aunt within a Turkish family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Impact of Armenian Elimination

The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had unforeseen and negative consequences for the Turkish communities, described as "shot themselves in the foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became "uninhabitable cities" due to the disappearance of the group that provided cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Essential services like dentists, tailors, and insurance companies vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Republican Era and Demographic Shifts

During the Republican period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities dwindled as their children were sent to Ankara and Istanbul for education and did not return to their hometowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Consequently, these cities gradually collapsed and decayed until the 1960s, becoming what is described as "Stone Age" or "Middle Ages" in terms of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

The economic development that began in the 1960s triggered a massive migration from villages to cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This led to the cities in the region gradually becoming "Turkified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### The "Kurdishization" of Eastern Turkey

Despite initial Turkification, the Republican regime's greatest success in the East of the Euphrates has been the "complete Kurdishization of this region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. While Kurds were a significant element before, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Today, they are almost homogeneously dominant in their own regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Current demographic realities:
*   **Mardin:** In the 1970s and 80s, Mardin city center had no trace of Kurds; the rural areas were Arab and Arabic-speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, a "wall" preventing Kurdish migration into Mardin city collapsed, and today Kurds constitute the numerical majority in the city center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Kızıltepe:** Located 20 kilometers from Mardin, Kızıltepe is a Kurdish city that experienced huge growth and became larger than Mardin itself due to the earlier prevention of Kurdish migration into Mardin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Diyarbakır:** Currently, Diyarbakır is "close to a hundred percent, if not a hundred percent, it is eighty to 90 percent" Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Van:** Kurds are "by far the majority" in Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Unavoidable Social Demands

The "complete Kurdishization" of the region has led to social demands that are deemed "impossible to prevent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It is argued that Kurdish must become an official language in the region, taught in schools, spoken on the streets, and dominant in government offices and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

> [!warning] The Indisputable Fact
> With a population of nearly 20 million, predominantly Kurdish-speaking with pride, it is impossible to hide or suppress the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. For those who know the region, it is "an indisputable fact" that everyone living there, including Turks, will need to learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Delaying this reality will only exacerbate problems and could lead to an "explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The region now boasts a homogeneous population of 20 million, with 87-90% Kurdish dominance, its own language, and an emerging class of "organic intellectuals" seeking to express national ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. It is argued that attempts to maintain the status quo, such as arresting leaders or bombing cities, are "futile efforts" in today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Geopolitical Considerations

Establishing a separate state in the region is seen as difficult due to the international conjuncture and the significant military power disparity between the Republic of Turkey and various Kurdish groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The United States, a vital partner and ally of Turkey, would not abandon or seek to disintegrate Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

However, certain powers would benefit from Türkiye's control weakening in the region in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Russia, viewing Turkey as a potential threat in the long term, would benefit if Türkiye's division, especially in areas closer to Russia, leads to loss of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Therefore, if states think long-term, Russia, Syria, and Iraq would benefit from the creation of a Kurdistan (or several Kurdistans) in the region, not America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

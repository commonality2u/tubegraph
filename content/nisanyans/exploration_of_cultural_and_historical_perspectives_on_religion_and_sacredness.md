This article explores various facets of religion and sacredness, from their philosophical interpretations to their historical and cultural impacts, drawing from discussions about scientific models, human perception, societal morality, and specific religious movements like Calvinism.

## The Universe, Human Understanding, and Divine Explanations

The discussion begins with a question regarding a "Newtonian universe," which is interpreted not as a query about Newton's physical laws, but rather about whether the universe contains dimensions beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. It is asserted that there are "definitely many concepts that we cannot grasp, that we do not know, that we do not understand, that we cannot solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

However, the speaker critiques the common human tendency to explain the unknown by invoking religious or holy teachings, labeling it a "typical trick of the trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This approach involves "elevating ignorance to an abstract entity consisting of a name," such as a "rainbow dragon," "Zeus," or "Allah," thereby giving the illusion of having solved or explained something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The argument highlights that saying "we do not know" is essentially the same as saying "we know that Allah created everything" because when asked "what is Allah?", the answer often returns to "we do not know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

The speaker suggests that knowledge cannot derive from ignorance, even after "thousands of years" of contemplation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This perspective views the human tendency to attribute the unknown to fantastical or divine causes as a "childish love of fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Sacredness

The concept of "sacred" is examined as a subjective human attribute rather than an inherent quality of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

> "Holiness is attributed. This is the expression. Holiness is attributed. Holiness is something that is in a person's perspective. It is a concept belonging to human psychology. It is not a concept related to objects." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>

The Kaaba is presented as an example: some perceive it as merely "a rectangular, absurd box with a cloth on it," while others view it as "the center of the whole universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>. This highlights the power of human perception in conferring meaning and value.

Furthermore, it is argued that "almost everything that is beautiful in the history of the world" and "created by man" has been inspired by the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. This includes art, architecture, painting, music, and literature, all often created with "the feeling of serving something sacred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>. Viewing such creations merely as a "set of colors on a board" is considered a "sterile point of view" that offers no benefit beyond "sailing into a void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.

## Calvinism and its Parallels in the Islamic World

The discussion delves into [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | Calvinism]], describing it as a "radical branch of Protestantism" that played a significant role in European history, particularly in the 16th, 17th, and even 18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. A fundamental characteristic of Calvinism was its strong anti-monarchical stance, positioning it as a key movement for republicanism in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. Key strongholds included Switzerland (Geneva, Tue, Bern), Holland, Scotland, and independent German city-states like Hamburg and Bremen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. French Calvinists (Huguenots), after a civil war, largely emigrated and were instrumental in the development of Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.

A core doctrinal difference of Calvinism, particularly Presbyterianism, was its rejection of a senior priestly class in the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Instead, each congregation was a "democratic structure that makes its own decisions" through "village meeting, church meeting" and "consensus, with common opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. This tradition is seen as foundational to American democracy and republicanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

The question arises whether an equivalent movement has emerged in the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. It is suggested that Islam's social structure and legal understanding are "closer to the Presbyterian understanding," or the Calvinist understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.

> "In Islam, the consensus of the ummah and the opinion of the ulema always prevail. Since the early days of Islam, the community tends not to accept the authority of a clergy class or administrators and has always been skeptical of the state and has strongly rejected the state's intervention in the field of law and legislation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>

Therefore, it can be claimed that "Islam has a strong Calvinist vein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.

## Faith, Morality, and Enlightenment

The discussion addresses whether a rational and educated person is more "enlightened" than someone like Aşık Veysel, who lives with "faith and clear faith from the heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The speaker states that faith itself does not make people more moral, better, more altruistic, or more considerate of others' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

> "The rate of theft and jerk among the most faithful and emotionally believers is higher than rational and educated people, that is, faith does not make us more moral, better, more altruistic, and more considerate of the rights of others." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>

Education, however, is presented as potentially increasing the likelihood of an individual "listening to a good voice" (moral rules) and decreasing the likelihood of listening to a "bad voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This is because comprehending and systematizing "general moral rules" requires a certain level of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The term "enlightened" ("Illuminated") is then defined not merely as personal goodness but as a "social value belonging to a very specific historical period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. It refers to an "educated class that emerged in Europe in the 18th century and has the claim of being above classes and above states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This class, despite its flaws, is credited with greater merits and rewards, and was highly esteemed in Western societies until the late 20th century, representing "high morality and a high culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:26">[02:29:26]</a>. The speaker notes the current "collapse of this class" without predicting its replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Religion's Role in Individual Reform

The discussion also touches upon the role of religious organizations in reforming individuals, specifically "wild murderers in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The speaker has witnessed groups like the Menzil community and other religious organizations "holding the hands" of individuals with "low intelligence" or "extremely low" chances of self-recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. While this method might not be effective for those with strong individualistic personalities, for the "most people in prison," the offering of "brotherhood, friendship and fairy tales" by a community is seen as a "healing thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. "Fairy tales" are posited as "a branch that a person can hold onto," acknowledged as beneficial in certain contexts, though "not for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Historical Context of Social Status and Gender

In old societies, two basic professions held high prestige: war and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The saying "it is a mistake for a kadi's daughter to be a kadi" (a judge's daughter to be a judge) is discussed. This proverb reflects the high status of judges (kadi) and the belief that their daughters were "relatively flawless" and "their packages have not been opened" (referring to virginity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This societal perception arose because while war was dangerous for both men and their daughters, the clergy were seen as more "settled, stable, secure" and "caring for their daughters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

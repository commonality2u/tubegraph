[[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman architecture]] is characterized by a rational, geometric, and abstract understanding of art, particularly evident in its high-period [[islamic_architecture_and_cultural_hegemony | Islamic architecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This style emphasizes creating highly complex structures from simple geometric forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Characteristics of Ottoman Architecture

[[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman architecture]] often demonstrates:
*   **Rationality and Geometry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>: It is built on a rational, totalitarian understanding of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The geometry is described as very striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Abstraction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>: The artistic approach is extremely abstract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Modern Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>: It reflects a very modern understanding of architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Ornamentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>: The style does not give much room to ornamentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Show of Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>: It is a mathematical understanding of art that emerges as a show of imperial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Bare Skeleton** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>: The "skeleton of Ottoman art" is described as bare and surprising in its rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Notable Examples

### Beyazidiye Complex, Edirne
The Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne is considered a significant [[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman work]] outside the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Construction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>: It was built during the reign of BeyazÄ±t II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Components** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>: It is a large [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman complex]] including a mosque, madrasah, and hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Impression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>: Despite being somewhat neglected with overgrown grass, its solid buildings and striking geometry left a strong impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It conveys a feeling of a place rarely visited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Sokullu Complex, Payas
The Sokullu Complex in Payas is another important [[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman work]], sharing the same "joke" or principle of imperial power as the Beyazidiye Complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These structures are the product of very powerful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Connection to [[islamic_architecture_and_cultural_hegemony | Islamic Architecture]]
The rational and geometric characteristics of [[ottoman_and_modern_turkish_architecture | Ottoman architecture]] are also generally found in high-period [[islamic_architecture_and_cultural_hegemony | Islamic architecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The idea that [[cultural_implications_of_ottoman_and_seljuk_architecture | Islamic civilization]] is not what people commonly think (perhaps implying a more nuanced view beyond common stereotypes) is connected to the maturation of this architectural understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The art reflects a culture very different from one sometimes defined as "backwards" or "ignorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

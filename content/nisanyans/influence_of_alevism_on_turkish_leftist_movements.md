Alevism, an Islamic mystical and heterodox tradition, has historically been a distinct and often marginalized community within Turkey. Its unique identity, shaped by centuries of oppression, has profoundly influenced Turkish leftist movements, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century.

## Historical Context and Identity

The Alevi society has historically been a closed society, with sensitive issues that are difficult for outsiders to fully grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01">[04:01]</a>. Its culture has evolved over centuries, leading to its current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. The Alevi identity, as it is largely known today, crystallized between the 15th and 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45">[06:45]</a>. This period saw the rise of the Safavid dynasties in Iran, which initiated a revolutionary and protest movement against classical Sunni Islam, mirroring the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22">[07:22]</a>.

This movement gained significant traction, threatening the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48">[07:48]</a>. The Ottoman state viewed this [[alevi_as_a_rebellion_movement | revolutionary movement]] as a deadly ideological danger and ruthlessly suppressed it for centuries, exiling Alevis to mountains, killing those declared illegal, and using all oppressive tools to destroy Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>. Consequently, Alevis never had good relations with the state, living illegally and often in hiding, worshipping secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02">[10:02]</a>.

The fundamental characteristic of Alevism is its resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law, and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>. This resistance led to a movement that rejects core Islamic practices like fasting, Sharia rules, pilgrimage, and zakat, yet still defines itself as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06">[14:06]</a>. This anti-establishment stance is a common thread that unifies the diverse groups within Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17">[41:17]</a>.

## Alevism and Political Affiliations

Due to their history of state hostility and opposition to Sunni Islam, Alevis have sought political avenues that offer protection or a sense of belonging.
Alevi communities today often align with the Republican People's Party (CHP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29">[29:29]</a>. This allegiance stems from the fact that [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Kemalism]], and the secularism it represents, provided the first historical opportunity for Alevis to claim a place within the state structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48">[29:48]</a>. It allowed them to aspire to positions within the state, such as civil servants, police officers, or generals, signaling that "this state is also our state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57">[29:57]</a>. In the absence of viable alternatives like socialism or a strong rule of law system, [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Kemalism]] remains the primary platform for Alevis to assert their rights and belonging in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33">[31:33]</a>. However, this is seen as a dead end, as Kemalist politics is destined to remain a minority and face defeat in a democratic system where the majority embraces Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38">[32:38]</a>.

In the 1960s, Alevis briefly attempted to engage with moderate right-wing politics, but after being disillusioned, they formed their own party, the Turkish Unity Party, which later shifted rapidly to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19">[33:19]</a>.

## Influence on Turkish Leftism

The most significant impact of Alevism on Turkish leftist movements occurred in the 1970s.
While Turkish leftism in the 1950s was primarily an elite, bourgeois movement concentrated in Istanbul and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04">[35:04]</a>, a turning point came in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10">[35:10]</a>. Subsequently, in the 1970s, a large segment of the youth—possibly 20 to 30 percent—became leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31">[35:31]</a>. This shift saw almost 90 percent of the revolutionary youth movement originating from Alevi society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52">[34:52]</a>.

The traditional Alevi regions, like the Sivas-Malatya-Tokat triangle, became fertile ground for leftist ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43">[35:43]</a>. The Turkish leftist tradition of the 1970s was largely nourished and shaped by Alevi culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48">[35:48]</a>. This influence is visible in various cultural elements:
*   **Music and Symbolism:** The *bağlama* (a stringed instrument) and Alevi folk songs (*nefes*) became iconic symbols of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10">[36:10]</a>.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Even aspects like "moustache rooms" and "parka fashions," as well as gender relations and the balance between rural and urban areas within the movement, were largely shaped by Alevi culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05">[36:05]</a>.
*   **Anti-Religious Stance:** The fundamental platform of the Turkish left, its "anti-Muslimness," directly reflects the Alevi stance against dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25">[36:25]</a>.

The upbringing within Alevi families, characterized by a fundamental distrust of official lies and state authority, instilled a resilience against ideological aggression from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37">[43:37]</a>. This inherent skepticism and opposition to state-imposed narratives contributed to the alignment of Alevis with leftist and anti-establishment movements.

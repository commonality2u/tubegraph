The speaker describes living in a national park since the beginning of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The setting includes large mountains covered with forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and a river that resembles a lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This body of water is partially located between Albania and another unspecified land, with the other half in Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Unique Ecosystem and Preservation
The northern end of this lake features a very wide reed bed, forming a wetland accessible by boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This natural paradise is noted for being unspoiled and untouched, though it was historically more populated with villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The river runs directly in front of the speaker's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, offering opportunities for fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Rich Biodiversity
The natural environment is likened to a National Geographic program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> due to its diverse wildlife. So far, nine types of water birds have been identified, including ducks, geese, cormorants, and cranes, excluding birds like swallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Observing these birds has a therapeutic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Being a young person in the 21st century presents significant difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:42">[01:47:42]</a>. These challenges manifest as various problems, struggles, and an ongoing effort to persevere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53">[01:47:53]</a>.

## Specific Challenges

### Desire to Migrate
Many young people frequently inquire about the possibility of migrating to Western countries such as America, England, or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. However, the speaker cautions that migration may be difficult as conditions in those places are "not going well at all," describing them as societies "rapidly drifting towards disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

### Influence of Education Systems
Some young people in Turkey are characterized as having been "brainwashed" by the [[challenges_in_turkish_education_system|Turkish education system]], leading them to hold a "glorifying Atatürk" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Societal Outlook on Future Generations

Despite current difficulties, there is a sentiment of hope regarding the future generation. While a sense of pessimism might arise in metropolitan areas like Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>, conversations with local people in places like Şirince reveal a belief that "the generation after us will be better than us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This belief suggests that current efforts and hardships are "not in vain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, contributing to maturity and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

Recent events in Syria mark a "big defeat" and a "big event" that will be remembered as a milestone in the history of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This geopolitical shift represents a significant victory for one side and a defeat for others, profoundly influencing [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. The outcome is believed to be the result of a compromise involving the United States, Russia, [[the_evolving_roles_of_regional_powers_such_as_turkey_iran_and_russia | TÃ¼rkiye]], Iran, and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Losers in the Syrian Conflict

### Russia
The recent developments are considered a major defeat for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Russia appears to have abandoned its claim to be a global player, losing its last military presence in the [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | Middle East]] and Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Even if it secures victories in Ukraine or Georgia, Russia has accepted its status as a regional power, capable of influencing only areas immediately surrounding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Its only remaining military presence outside the former Soviet Union is in the Sahel region of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This phase indicates that Russia has unfortunately lost its ability to be an effective player on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The reliability of Russia as a partner for any actor has also suffered a heavy blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Iran
Iran has suffered a significant defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Its long-standing policy of establishing an influence area in the [[tensions_and_conflicts_in_the_middle_east | Middle East]], pursued since 2001, has faced defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Syria was a key "door" for Iran's strategic ambitions, particularly for its access to the Mediterranean and its support for groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. By losing this, Iran's ability to project power beyond its geographical confines has been severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This strategic setback might paradoxically lead Iran to seek a modus vivendi, or peaceful coexistence, with the United States and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, as the underlying strategic threat causing its hostility with the Western alliance has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Iran has taken a big step towards becoming a smaller or medium-sized state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### China
China has also incurred a serious blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a project to connect China to Europe and the Mediterranean by road, has two key countries along its chain: Turkey and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. With both potentially under the control of the NATO/American alliance, China's grand project may suffer significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### Syrian People
The Syrian people are identified as ultimate losers in this conflict, with the possibility of peace seen as weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The overthrow of dictators, historically touted as leading to democracy, has often resulted in chaos and division, as seen in Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. The future of Syria is uncertain, and the establishment of a strong central authority is deemed very difficult without further bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>.

## Winners in the Syrian Conflict

### United States and Israel
The United States and Israel are considered the clear winners of this geopolitical chess match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>. They have successfully implemented a regional plan prepared over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Their strategy, which began around October 2022/2023, involved stages such as turning a blind eye to Hamas's attack, eliminating Gaza, neutralizing Hezbollah, and swiftly overthrowing Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. They achieved their objectives without firing a single bullet or losing a single soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This outcome suggests America has reversed its trend of losing every war it has entered for the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

### Turkey
[[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Turkey]] appears to have gained a certain, albeit small, advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. While Turkish media suggests significant control, Turkey's role in the American-Israeli victory is understood to be marginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>, limited to the effectiveness of its allied Free Syrian Army in Azaz and Afrin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Turkey was likely compelled to adapt to the prevailing scenario rather than actively shaping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. Turkey chose to align with the victorious side, which was a wise choice given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. This alignment might allow Turkey a share in the reconstruction of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

### Kurds
The Kurds are identified as major beneficiaries of this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. It is now understood that Syria will likely consist of at least two regions: a Syrian state centered in Damascus and Aleppo dominated by the HTS, and a largely independent Kurdish region east of the Euphrates, similar to Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. The Kurds are expected to play an important role in the new Syria, potentially as one of the two main players at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Turkey will eventually need to compromise with and accept this new Kurdish formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. Symbolic actions, such as a rumored invitation by Donald Trump to the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to a coronation ceremony, reinforce American support for the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The [[geopolitical_shifts_in_the_21st_century_postsyria_conflict | conflict in Syria]], ongoing since 2011, is fundamentally a struggle between the American-Israeli front and the Iran-Russia front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. The recent outcome confirms the victory of one side and the defeat of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that the United States seems to have been preparing this strategy for several years, demonstrating a successful and commendable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. The tactic of projecting war drums by European states and American politicians is seen as a skillful policy aimed at intimidating Russia, deterring it from further adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>. This approach aims to avoid direct confrontation while asserting dominance in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:20:00">[43:20:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the complex dynamics of great power competition are revealed in the [[role_of_western_and_arab_states_in_geopolitical_conflicts | Middle East]], where regional conflicts become arenas for broader strategic objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

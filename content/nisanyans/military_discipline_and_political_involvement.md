The incident involving graduating lieutenants from the Turkish Armed Forces who took a "pirate oath" and drew a sword during their ceremony, leading to their expulsion, sparked a discussion on military discipline and [[politics_in_the_country | political]] engagement within the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>.

## Dangers of Political Soldiers
The speaker believes that there is "nothing as dangerous as a soldier trying to become a [[politics_in_the_country | political actor]]" in a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>. When such a possibility or tendency arises, it is considered right to "crush the head of the snake while it is young" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The dismissal of these lieutenants is seen as the "minimum possible punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Importance of Discipline
Discipline is the fundamental basis of the military and military education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The indispensable feature of modern armies is that "order is absolute" and must be obeyed when given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. In this incident, the lieutenants reportedly submitted a petition eight or nine times to read the oath differently, and it was rejected each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Their actions were therefore knowing and a deliberate act of disobedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The speaker suggests they "should be thankful" for their punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Offense
The speaker, who was tried for 24 years in prison for allegedly inciting the Turkish army to rebel, noted that this situation at the Military Academy graduation was a "[[the_concept_of_uprisings_and_leadership_requirements | mass uprising]]" in front of national cameras and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Such an incident is considered a "crime of rebellion," for which the penalty "should be death penalty under different conditions and at different times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The penalty for [[the_concept_of_uprisings_and_leadership_requirements | military uprising]] has historically been the death penalty in every society and era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. From this perspective, the lieutenants "got off very cheaply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

While expressing respect for young people who challenge authority and express political ideas, the speaker concluded that these individuals "chose the wrong profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. It was considered beneficial that their career in the [[modern_military_service_and_national_identity | Turkish Armed Forces]] was terminated early, as they "lack the personality traits that would adapt to the [[modern_military_service_and_national_identity | military profession]]" and, if successful, "would have been a serious threat to the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This outcome was seen as good for both the young people and the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

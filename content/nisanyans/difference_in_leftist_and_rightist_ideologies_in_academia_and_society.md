## The Leftist Perspective in Academia

The [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | academy]] has traditionally shown a strong affinity for leftist ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. This is seen as natural because the fundamental concept of the left emphasizes considering the general interests and benefits of society, rather than solely the personal interests of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. The [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | intellectual]] class is traditionally expected to champion this viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

The core tenets of the leftist perspective include:
*   Prioritizing the collective good over individual unscrupulous interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   Developing policies that benefit society at large, even if it conflicts with individual or group interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   A moral obligation to serve the needs and interests of others, particularly the vulnerable and non-dominant groups without power or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

### Historical Role of Intellectuals

Historically, the expectation for cultural, moral, and scientific elites was to remain detached from worldly interests and dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. In the European tradition, including madrasahs, university members were often forbidden from marrying until recent times, signifying a monastic dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This was based on the belief that family responsibilities inevitably compel individuals to prioritize their own family's interests, which would conflict with their duty to serve the broader society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

## Modern Deformation of the Leftist Tradition

The traditional understanding of the [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | university]] and the leftist tradition has undergone a "strange deformation" in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. What is now presented as leftist thinking is often a "pathological way of thinking" disconnected from classical leftist definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

Today, universities are seen as training two types of individuals:
1.  **Civil servants**: Individuals whose primary life philosophy is to "do what the boss says" and obey rules, lacking connection to the traditional cultural elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Their function is reduced to mechanically processing paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
2.  **The unemployed**: A group specialized in "empty talk," lacking social function and purpose, and often ignorant but proud of their ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

This shift means the [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | university's]] function no longer involves fostering a cultural elite that represents the general interests of society, especially the defenseless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. The current state suggests that it might be time to consider closing these institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

## Societal Engagement with Politics: Beyond Ideology

Most people's interest in politics in Turkey, and perhaps more broadly, is not driven by political effect or problem-solving, but rather by an inherent human need for "fighting" or "discharge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. This often manifests as supporting a "team," similar to a football team, where engagement involves swearing at opponents and engaging in conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

This "we vs. them" mentality means that individuals who genuinely seek solutions, develop strategies, or analyze the broader picture are often insulted or ostracized by the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Producing solutions and understanding the general picture can spoil the "fun" of daily political clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

## Societal Norms and Political Thought

### Herd Mentality and Conformity
A strong "herd mentality" guides public engagement, where people tend to follow what everyone else is doing or discussing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. This means individuals want to be aware of popular topics to avoid losing social standing or being mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. The speaker questions how [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | thought leaders]] allow humanity to descend into such trivialities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

### Hierarchical vs. Egalitarian Human Nature
Human nature appears to possess both hierarchical and egalitarian tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. There is an inherent desire to trust and follow a leader or a path, especially when faced with complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Simultaneously, a sense of equality exists, where each individual is recognized as a living, feeling person with inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. This means no authority can be absolute, and individuals retain the right and obligation to disagree with guidance that doesn't align with their own perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

### Contemporary Islam and Social Fear
Modern [[catholic_and_orthodox_churchs_sociological_and_cultural_impact | Islam]] is characterized as an ideology born from social fear, reflecting a sense of weakness and being "beaten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. This leads to a defensive, withdrawn stance, with people clinging to known ideological frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. However, a significant problem is the lack of an [[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | intellectual pioneer class]] to renew and deepen this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Consequently, it often results in the defense of "absurd" and "primitive" interpretations, like outdated dress codes or "breast science," marketed by "ignorant village preachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

### Gender Equality and Societal Harmony
The speaker suggests that the concept of gender equality, particularly as expressed through feminism, is a "wrong interpretation" that is incompatible with human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. This ideology is viewed as "extremely harmful," aiming to destroy human happiness and the fundamental infrastructure of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. Since the 1960s and 70s, it has increasingly pervaded educated classes, despite societal structures being based on delicate balances between women and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

The speaker personally believes women are generally superior to men in many areas, possessing better minds, being more cold-blooded, ruthless, and psychologically resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Men, outside of certain advantages, should generally submit to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. The "false equality" promoted by feminism has sabotaged this inherent human relationship order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. The recent developments regarding [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] and transsexuality in the Western world are seen as further indications of an "anti-family" perspective reaching a point of collapse and unsustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

On July 14th, a significant incident occurred in America where a presidential candidate was reportedly shot [00:06:53]. The target was [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]], who was shot in the ear [00:07:04].

## Theories Regarding the Incident
The speaker evaluates several theories circulating, cautioning that comments are based solely on publicly available information [00:07:46].

### Theory 1: Individual Madman
The first theory suggests that an individual "madman" got carried away and shot [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] [00:08:10]. However, the speaker dismisses this as "completely ridiculous" [00:08:17]. It is deemed naive to believe an ordinary, unprofessional 20-year-old could reach a heavily protected area and shoot without hesitation [00:08:41].

Historically, "countless assassination incidents in American history" have involved organizations [00:09:05]. The speaker notes that the [[american_elections_and_trump | American state]] has a long, professional, and continuous record of organizing assassinations outside of America [00:09:37].

The speaker further argues that the ruling "junta" in America has aggressively pursued [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] since 2016, operating under the ideology that "any way is permissible to stop Trump" [00:10:22].
Examples of this alleged approach include:
*   Claiming [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] was a Russian agent for 5-6 years, a claim later proven false [00:10:44].
*   Covering up scandals involving Joe Biden and his son by labeling them a "Russian conspiracy" through 51 senior officials [00:11:05].
*   Trampling [[american_elections_and_trump | American law]] underfoot to remove [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] from politics [00:11:19].

To believe such an administration is incapable of organizing an assassination is considered "Pollyanna naivety" or "Alice in Wonderland" thinking [00:11:51].

### Theory 2: Intentional Ear Shot
Another theory posits that the aim was specifically to shoot [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] in the ear, not to kill him [00:12:05]. Experts consulted by the speaker state that shooting someone in the ear from 150 meters away is extremely risky and virtually impossible to guarantee [00:12:26]. Such a precise outcome cannot be known or guaranteed by a shooter [00:12:45].

### Theory 3: Staged Event
A third [[conspiracy_theories_and_authority | conspiracy theory]] suggests that no actual shots were fired at [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]]; instead, only gunshots were heard, and [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] pretended to be hit, perhaps cutting his own ear with a razor for a "tremendous performance" or "show" [00:12:56].

The speaker dismisses this theory due to two main problems:
1.  **Lack of Need:** [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] "already won the election by a wide margin" and does not need such a show to increase popularity [00:13:29]. While a struggling candidate like Biden might find it understandable, [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] does not [00:13:40].
2.  **Casualty:** A person in the crowd died during the incident, indicating that shots were indeed fired [00:14:04].

### The Shooter's Elimination
The fact that the person who fired the shot was not captured is deemed "very suspicious" [00:14:18]. This behavior is described as common in such incidents to "eliminate possible witnesses" [00:14:29]. The speaker draws a parallel to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, where the suspected shooter was killed shortly after being apprehended [00:14:40]. This is described as "typical mafia behavior," where the assassin must be eliminated to prevent them from speaking or revealing connections [00:14:55].

## Future Predictions Regarding Donald Trump
The speaker's "guess is that they will not allow [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] to win this election under any circumstances" [00:15:27]. It is believed that every method will be attempted [00:15:38].

The notion that even if elected, [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] would be ineffective or surrender to the [[american_elections_and_trump | American state]]'s established organization and intelligence is rejected [00:15:51]. While [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] has been a "blabbermouth and a liar" and has not fulfilled promises, often aligning with the demands of the [[american_elections_and_trump | American state]]'s intelligence, security, and military forces (e.g., in Syria, Iran, Covid incidents) [00:16:07], he is also seen as a "very risky anarchist" [00:16:56].

There is a "blood feud" between [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] and those who have tried to destroy him for years [00:17:03]. The risk the "junta" faces if [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] comes to power is "very high" [00:17:13]. This "junta" is described as a powerful organization with military, financial, and intelligence capabilities that has committed many crimes and has "legitimate concerns" about what will happen to them [00:17:20].

Therefore, the speaker sees no reason to believe they will not try to eliminate [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]], who represents a "mortal danger to them" [00:18:11]. Possible outcomes include:
*   Imprisonment [00:18:17].
*   Death (e.g., a sudden natural death) [00:18:19].
*   Another assassination [00:18:26].
*   A "completely unexpected new [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]" [00:18:35] (e.g., finding impossible-to-accept dirt from his past, which is deemed not difficult given his "dirty" nature) [00:18:45].

### Biden's Withdrawal
The recent decision to push President Biden "under the bus" by exposing his senility during a debate, leading to calls for his withdrawal from the Democratic Party's heavyweights including Obama, suggests a deeper strategy [00:19:27]. The speaker concludes that this action implies the establishment is "sure that [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] will be a party to the election," meaning they are confident that "Trump will not be the candidate" [01:02:24].

## Broader Concerns
The speaker views the current political climate in the [[american_elections_and_trump | United States]] as a "disgrace" [01:05:51]. While the current administration is a disgrace, [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] is considered "a worse disgrace" [01:05:51]. The situation is described as "mud wrestling" with neither side being better [01:05:51]. It's suggested that the decay in the [[american_elections_and_trump | US]] cannot be fixed by internal factors or a "decent candidate" emerging, as there hasn't been one for years (perhaps since Carter or Nixon in the 1970s) [00:22:03].

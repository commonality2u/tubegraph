Since 2001, there has been an observable increase in a specific power dynamic within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Following the September 11th Twin Towers attacks, a particular cadre emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This group systematically dismantled the state apparatus and transformed existing democratic norms and traditions in America into what is described as a "fraud and a buffoon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Post-9/11 Power Cadre

This cadre has successfully seized permanent power by undermining the competition between political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They increasingly dominate the ideology and institutions of a national security state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. According to observations, this ruling group adheres to rules only when it suits them, otherwise, rules are disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The election of Donald Trump was seen as a "rupture" in this cadre's process of absolutizing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Removing the Power Structure

It is deemed "extremely difficult or even impossible" to remove this cadre and structure from power through normal political procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For such a removal to occur, one of three drastic possibilities must materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>:
*   A very large and radical financial crisis, leading to a [[political_shifts_and_changes_in_global_power_dynamics | political crisis]] where the state cannot pay its debts or salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   A civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   The third possibility is left unspecified, but the speaker emphasizes that without one of these scenarios, dislodging this "mountain of power" seems impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Shifts in US Alliances

The traditionally strong alliance between Israel and the United States, which once seemed "shakeless," is now showing signs of wear and tear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This marks the first time since the 1950s that the alliance is exhibiting such instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

Notably, when the Ukraine War began, Israel adopted a position separate from the Western alliance, which was unprecedented and surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. Israel maintained an equidistant stance between Russia and Ukraine, seemingly without reaction from America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. This indicates a growing distance between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

The [[middle_east_geopolitical_shifts | American hegemony]] in the Middle East, upon which Israel had relied for a "big bully position" in recent years, is now seriously shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. This shift, coupled with the understanding that the American military presence in Syria cannot be sustained, is significantly altering options for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.

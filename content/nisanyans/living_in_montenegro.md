The speaker describes their living situation in [[travel_and_food_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]], specifically in the coastal city of Tivat.

## Current Residence: Tivat
The speaker resides in Tivat, a city in [[travel_and_food_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]], located near Kotor on the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is described as their "winter house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They were previously living in Tivat until May of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The house in Tivat has seen some changes, with the order of the room and the table's position being altered to be "more beautiful" and "more comfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Tivat is characterized as a "small cute town" that primarily sustains itself through tourism and investments from wealthy Russian and Turkish businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Previous Residence: Riek
Earlier, in the summer, they had moved to a house in Riek (presumably Rijeka) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This Riek house was referred to as a "wonder of the world," but its living conditions were "a bit primitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It was concluded that it "wouldn't make much sense to live there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The decision to leave Riek was made by Ms. Ira, though the speaker personally would have preferred to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This led to their return to Tivat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

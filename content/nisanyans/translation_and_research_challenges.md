A speaker discusses the demanding nature of a specific [[translation_work_and_challenges|translation project]] they have been undertaking.

## Nature of the Project
The project is described as "more than a translation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:11">[02:17:11]</a>, involving the translation of a "century-old text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This [[translation_project_of_an_unfinished_encyclopedia|translation project of an unfinished encyclopedia]] required extensive work for each article.

## Difficulties Encountered
The speaker states that "each article required detailed research and explanation, interpretation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This intensive [[translation_work_and_challenges|translation work]] had a significant personal toll:
> "it has been tiring me out terribly for the last few months and there really is a job that made me feel like a zombie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>

## Personal Impact and Learning
Despite the exhausting nature of the work, the [[translation_work_and_challenges|translation project]] offered educational benefits. The speaker had "the opportunity to learn and get to know some subjects that I did not know before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a> due to this extensive translation effort.

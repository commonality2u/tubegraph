The Turkish language has a rich history of absorbing vocabulary from various sources, reflecting centuries of cultural, political, and scientific interactions. Notably, French played a significant role in modernizing Turkish vocabulary, particularly from the 19th century onwards.

## French Influence on Turkish

For approximately 150 years, from the 1810s-1820s until the 1960s, French served as the primary reference language for the Turks during Türkiye's adaptation to the modern world [00:25:11]. This period saw a massive influx of French words into Turkish vocabulary.

### Quantification of French Loanwords

Within the standard Turkish vocabulary—excluding highly specialized fields and focusing on words a person with general culture would use—approximately 4,800 words have entered Turkish from French [00:23:28]. This number is significant when considering a common vocabulary treasury of about 15,000 words [00:23:36].

### Historical Phases of French Word Adoption

Initially, French words entering Turkish in the 18th century and before 1810-1850 were primarily labels for foreign cultural concepts. These words, such as "general," "archduke," "duchess," "prince," "mademoiselle," "cardinal," and "senor," described a foreign culture and often had no meaning within Ottoman society [00:27:09]. They were seen as external concepts, much like "sushi" or "siesta" might be perceived as foreign today [00:27:43].

Around 1810, a new wave of concepts began to enter Turkish intensively from French, reflecting societal modernization [00:28:07]. These words were adaptable and importable into Turkish society, marking a shift from mere labels to integrated concepts.

#### Categories of French-Derived Vocabulary

*   **New Cultural Phenomena**:
    *   "Gazeta" (newspaper), first heard in Türkiye around 1796-1798 in Izmir, later in Istanbul [00:28:16].
    *   "Musician" [00:29:14].
    *   "Lotarya" (lottery), seen in 1820 [00:29:24].
    *   New furniture types like "sofa" [00:29:35].
    *   The game of "billiards" [00:29:42].
    *   New clothing items such as "coat" and "tie" [00:29:51].
    *   "Cigarette" and "cigaret," entering around the 1840s [00:30:09].
    *   "Ticket," a concept previously absent in traditional Ottoman and Islamic society, used for public entertainment (theater, opera) and public transportation (railway, ferry) [00:30:25].
*   **Technical and Scientific Innovations**:
    *   "Vap" (steamship), directly taken from "bateau à vapeur" [01:18:18].
    *   "Şifer" (railway), from the 1830s [01:18:25].
    *   "Telegraph," a new concept heard in the 1820s-1830s [01:18:35].
    *   Words for scientific concepts like "electricity" (dated 1811) [01:18:40], "physics" [01:18:44], "thermometer," and "barometer" [01:18:47], which had no place in traditional Islamic sciences [01:18:45].
    *   "Cholera," the name of the disease, entered the Ottoman lands in 1820 from French [01:18:50].
*   **Commercial Products and Items**:
    *   "Kotra" (a type of boat) [01:18:57].
    *   New fabrics like "calico" and "flannel," products of the Industrial Revolution [01:19:02].
    *   "Lampshade" [01:19:06].
    *   "Diamond" (referring to a specific cut of diamond, a new imported concept) [01:19:07].
*   **Institutional and Regulatory Terms**:
    *   "Bank," a new concept differing from traditional money changers [01:19:15].
    *   "Parliament" [01:19:20].
    *   "Commander," transferred from French to the Ottoman Land Forces during the first revision period (1820-1830) [01:19:27].
    *   "Policy" (referring to interstate diplomacy and international relations, a new concept for Ottomans) [01:19:35].
    *   "Dictator," known in Turkish since Napoleon's time [01:19:48].
    *   "Police" and "gendarmerie," entirely new concepts (Mahmud II era or 1840s) [01:19:50].
    *   "Budget" [01:20:00].

These words came as part of a modernization "baggage," representing concepts previously unknown or without equivalents in Ottoman society [00:31:02].

### French vs. Ottoman Military Terminology

The word "strategy" (from Ancient Greek *strategos*, meaning commander, army-guiding [01:14:52]) became a new concept in 1810, emerging during the Napoleonic wars with the rapid evolution of military thought [01:14:23]. The Ottomans, during the modernization of their army around 1880, adopted and coined two new words: "sevkülceyş" (dispatching the army, literal translation of strategy [01:17:34]) and "tabiye" (positioning, literal translation of tactic [01:17:51]). These words were used intensively until the 1940s and 1950s, but were later replaced by the direct French borrowings "strategy" and "tactic" [01:18:06].

### Shift to English

After the 1960s, particularly post-1983, French was largely replaced by English as the reference language for Turkish [00:25:38]. Currently, English is the primary source for new concepts and vocabulary [00:25:44].

## Other Language Influences

While French holds a prominent place in modern Turkish vocabulary, other languages have also left their mark:

*   **Arabic and Persian**: Older layers of Turkish vocabulary include numerous words from Arabic and Persian, particularly in academic, religious, and literary contexts. The discussion on "mesel" (example) and "mesele" (issue/question) highlights distinctions based on Arabic roots, showcasing the depth of this influence. The word "sevkülceyş," an Ottoman creation, has Arabic roots [01:17:34]. In the context of Armenian society before the 5th century AD, the aristocracy's language and royal decrees were partly Persian, indicating a broader regional linguistic interaction [01:56:07]. This reflects the long-standing influence of [[Turkish and Persian literary evolution | Persian]] and Arabic on the languages of the region.

*   **Ancient Greek**: The etymology of "strategy" traces back to Ancient Greek, showing that even modern concepts can have very old linguistic roots [01:14:47].

*   **Syriac**: In early Armenian society, Syriac was used, particularly in southern provinces, influencing religious texts [01:57:09]. While not directly impacting Turkish, it illustrates the complex linguistic tapestry of the region.

## The Nature of Language Evolution and Dictionaries

Language is dynamic; it develops and changes daily [01:42:27]. This constant evolution means that dictionaries, especially modern ones, should reflect current usage, including new words regardless of their origin [01:42:07]. The speaker advocates for a modern dictionary that embraces crowdsourcing, utilizes technical infrastructure and bot networks to detect all circulating words (regardless of origin, like English or Chinese [01:44:08]), and is curated by a strong editorial team [01:44:36]. This approach acknowledges that a word is considered "Turkish" if people who believe they are speaking Turkish use it and it conveys meaning [01:44:06].

This broad perspective on what constitutes a language's vocabulary, encompassing both ancient borrowings and recent technical terms, highlights the continuous and multifaceted impact of other languages on Turkish.

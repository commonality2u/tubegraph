The final program of the year includes an [[upcoming_trip_to_ethiopia_and_broadcasting_challenges | Ethiopia tour]] that was announced last week and is now taking more serious shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While the price and full program cannot yet be announced, they are expected to be revealed in the next few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Dates
The tour is currently planned for March 1st - March 14th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This will be a 14-day, two-week trip, taking place in the first half of March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Itinerary
The program appears to be very exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Southern Ethiopia**: The tour will explore the southernmost part of [[cultural_and_historical_insights_into_ethiopia | Ethiopia]], specifically the Omo River Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This region, known as the Southern Peoples State, is home to tribes speaking dozens of different languages with unique customs, quite far from modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Harar**: The program also intends to include Harar, a historical Muslim city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. After visiting Harar, there will be a visit to the "number one artistic tourist attraction of Harar," which is mentioned as Arthur Rimbaud's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Cost and Logistics
The tour is acknowledged to "not be a very cheap tour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Efforts are being made to keep the cost under $2,000 per person, though it might be a little more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The higher cost is attributed to necessary infrastructure guarantees, such as hotels without lice and buses that won't break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This contrasts with traveling alone, which could involve street vendors and beat-up cars at lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Community Aspect
Previous tours (four or five, including a Moscow visit) have led to the formation of active WhatsApp groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These groups continue to meet, chat, and get together, forming a "congregation" or "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

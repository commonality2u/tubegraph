## The Challenges of Political Power

The speaker observes a prevailing difficulty in changing governments through elections, suggesting that modern election technology and management methods have made it increasingly challenging to effect change [00:00:44]. This leads to a discussion on the nature of political leadership and the mechanisms required to wield power effectively.

### The Hypothetical Presidency: A Radical Approach
When asked about the first moves as a hypothetical President, the speaker outlines a radical approach designed to achieve significant change and consolidate power:

*   **General Amnesty** A primary step would be a general amnesty, specifically for "crimes against the state" or "crimes of thought" [00:09:38]. This amnesty would explicitly exclude crimes against women and property, such as murder, theft, or rape [00:08:59]. The aim is to pardon offenses defined by political power, signaling a shift in regime [00:09:17]. Such an amnesty should be enacted unconditionally through a clear two-article law [01:10:46].
*   **Accumulating Power and Information** True authority goes beyond paper; a leader needs the state mechanism to obey orders, not just acknowledge them [01:11:31]. To achieve this, the leader requires comprehensive information about the country's inner workings, including "what's going on in whose mind, whose hand is in whose pocket" [01:12:44].
*   **Establishing a Private Intelligence Organization** The speaker suggests establishing an intelligence organization directly accountable to the President [01:12:59]. Existing state institutions are deemed unsuitable as they are designed to protect the existing power structures [01:13:18]. This new organization would gather useful elements from existing ones, consolidate them, and "liquidate the rest" to prevent sabotage [01:13:50].
*   **Creating a Special Treasury/Budget** To fund desired projects, employ people, and direct civil and military actions, a leader needs a "special and special budget outside the public budget" [01:14:18]. The public budget is described as paralyzed by bureaucracy, making it difficult to allocate funds freely [01:15:00]. While such a method is commonly labeled as "corruption," it is presented as a necessity for a revolutionary leader [01:16:05]. This involves negotiating taxes and commissions with businesses, e.g., a 25% "bribe" or "commission" on permissions like building a nuclear power plant [01:17:13].
*   **The Principle of Fear (Machiavelli)** Citing Niccolò Machiavelli, the speaker states that a head of state should be "feared, not loved" [01:18:26]. Obedience to orders stems from the understanding that disloyalty will lead to severe consequences [01:18:45].
*   **Terror as a Tool** To establish authority, a radical head of state may need to "click some important people who are in sight for the purpose of making an example and terror" and "even kill them" to demonstrate the seriousness of their intent [01:19:25]. This ensures prompt execution of orders [01:19:36].

### The Tyrannical Spiral
The speaker notes that the path of radical change, characterized by these steps, has been historically followed by leaders from Hitler and Lenin to American presidents, Napoleon, Atatürk, and Abdulhamid [02:10:05]. However, the continued application of these methods leads to a "spiral of tyranny" [02:20:09]:

*   Initial revolutionary steps may be effective for a few years [02:10:05].
*   Over time, the system "gets stuck" and starts to "wound" itself [02:10:05].
*   The established intelligence organization becomes an "uncontrolled oppression force" [02:22:47].
*   The parallel state structure and budget become a "swamp of corruption" and "economic gangster chain" [02:23:03].
*   The use of intimidation and killings loses its effect, requiring escalation to maintain credibility, leading to more terror [02:33:30].

Ultimately, "every revolutionary turns into a dictator" [02:39:59], and every dictator eventually reaches the end of their "useful life" [02:40:40]. These are "points that people who seriously study two or three thousand years of history and think about what [[political_power_and_scientific_progress | political power]] means will inevitably come to" [02:44:49].

## The Elusive Nature of Freedom

The discussion then pivots to [[concept_and_evolution_of_democracy_and_freedom | philosophical discussion on morality]] and [[western_and_eastern_concepts_of_freedom_and_modernity | Western and Eastern concepts of freedom and modernity]]. A friend's definition of freedom is presented:
*   **Moral freedom:** A person who can form their own value judgments with their own will and live accordingly [02:50:04].
*   **Political freedom:** A person who can change or at least limit the political power they are attached to with their own choice [02:59:02].

The speaker challenges these definitions, particularly the idea of an individual forming value judgments "with their own will" [02:59:02]. This is deemed largely impossible, as value judgments are shaped by upbringing, accidents, fate, coincidences, and societal currents [02:59:02]. People often convince themselves they have freely chosen their values to justify themselves [02:59:02]. Similarly, the idea that an individual's choice directly changes political power is seen as an "illusion" [02:59:02], as societal behaviors are aggregated in complex ways, not by individual will [02:59:02].

### The Evolution of Western Freedom
Despite these criticisms, the speaker acknowledges that the Western world has indeed underlined a claim of freedom over the past 250 years [03:03:00]. This phenomenon has two levels:

1.  **Ancient Freedoms:** Certain freedoms have existed in the Western world since the Middle Ages [03:17:17]. This refers to the relative freedom of powerful individuals (lords, feudal rulers with their own armies) from the king, based on mutual respect and boundary recognition [04:06:03]. Another dimension is the independence of religious authority (the church) from the state [04:07:05]. These concepts developed from Europe's fragmented and chaotic political structure, where central authority faced fierce resistance over centuries [04:07:05].
    *   This contrasts with the Ottoman system, where ruling classes were civil servants whose fate and property were at the sultan's whim [04:48:55].
    *   The speaker notes that, contrary to common Western belief, the "Bright Age of the Islamic World" (before the Ottomans) exhibited similar freedoms to European feudalism, with fragmented power shared among many layers and feudal lords, and a legally defined area of religious freedom even from the ruler [05:02:59].

2.  **Modern Age Freedom (Three Revolutions):** This concept of freedom, specific to the modern age, emerged from three major revolutions:
    *   **The French Revolution (late 18th century):** Marked the declaration of independence of individuals from the "coercive dominance of religion" [03:20:55]. This was a consequence of the devastating 200-year European civil war over Christianity, leading to the acceptance that individuals could free themselves from religious obligations without blame [03:31:10]. This unprecedented revolution fostered significant advancements in science, knowledge, and political ideas [03:34:45]. It also allowed thinkers to explore "ghostly subjects" and develop theories potentially dangerous to society, moving beyond the moral world of religion that aimed to protect social order [03:40:00].
    *   **Post-World War I (1918 onwards):** The infrastructure for this revolution was laid by massive migration from villages to gigantic cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York [03:54:55]. City dwellers gained the freedom of anonymity, shedding local identities, community restrictions, and moral concerns [03:54:55]. This led to radical changes in customs and traditions, including provocative clothing (especially for women) and the normalization of extramarital affairs [03:54:55]. Art movements focusing on "shocking people" also gained prevalence [03:54:55].
    *   **The 1968 Revolution:** Driven by a rapid increase in the university population, which diluted the traditional function of university life [03:42:00]. This revolution led to widespread adoption of "tremendous freedom in sexual morality" [03:42:00]. The development of birth control methods played a crucial role in reducing the risks associated with sexual intercourse, opening up new horizons for personal freedom [03:42:00].

These three revolutions, by pushing religion into the background, eliminating traditional local identity pressures, and liberating sexual life, significantly advanced moral and political freedom [04:24:00]. For 250 years, Western societies became a "tremendous attraction" globally for those who valued freedom [04:24:00], drawing people like a "magnet" [04:24:00].

### The Unsustainability of Unchecked Freedom
The speaker questions the sustainability of this "freedom climb" [04:24:00] and whether the current state of increased freedoms has produced truly "good results for humanity and for people" [04:24:00]. The concern is that while loosening restrictive frameworks increases individual freedom, completely destroying these frameworks leads to "collapse and disperse" [04:24:00]. The West, having pursued freedom for 250 years, may be reaching a "bankruptcy point, a collapse point" [04:24:00], indicating a need to "re-establish some things" [04:24:00].

## Modernization and the New Age of Global Dynamics

The conversation also touches on [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | global political dynamics]] and the shifting concepts of modernization. The speaker notes the rise of new models of modernity, exemplified by Saudi Arabia's recent bold moves.

Prince Salman is presented as a figure leading an "incredible revolution" in the Arab world [01:13:51]. This includes ambitious architectural projects like a "new Kaaba" (a massive cube-shaped building) [01:14:19] and "NEM," a giant desert city designed like a "Space Base" [01:14:34]. These projects, even if merely dreams, are seen as significant for their vision, signaling that these nations are "the pioneers of modernity in this age" and that "the West is finished" [01:15:14].

Accompanying these architectural statements are radical shifts in foreign policy:
*   Cutting off relations with traditional patrons like England and America [01:15:43].
*   Reaching agreements with Iran [01:15:48] and accepting Syria back into regional forums [01:15:54].
*   Announcing trade in non-dollar currencies, especially with Chinese money [01:16:02].
*   Refusing to participate in sanctions against Russia [01:16:15].

These actions signify a declaration of independence and a claim to be the "representatives of modernism in the world, the leading power of the new age" [01:16:22]. This new modernism is being pursued "without abandoning the Islamic label and the Islamic tradition" [01:17:53], suggesting a redefinition of what modernization and secularization might mean in the 21st century [01:17:04]. The speaker suggests that traditional [[philosophical_and_ethical_considerations | secularization]] might be a "room of a past era" [01:17:12] tailored to Europe's specific historical needs.

### Comparing Ottoman and Russian Reforms
A key [[philosophical_thoughts_on_life_legacy_and_social_dynamics | historical question]] arises regarding why reforms in the Ottoman Empire, under leaders like Atatürk or Mahmud II, couldn't achieve the permanence and transformative success seen in Russia's reforms under Peter the Great [01:18:20].

The answer lies in the different social structures of modernization:
*   **Russia:** The "engine of change" and the "main mass of change" were carried by ethnic Russians, the politically sovereign group [02:00:07]. New types of artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen emerged from this dominant group, acting under a unified Russian identity [02:00:07].
*   **Ottoman Empire:** The leadership of change and modernization was taken not by the state-dominant group, but by Christian elements (Greeks, Armenians, Christian Arabs, Serbs, Bulgarians) who were distinct in religion and social structure [02:11:10]. While these groups achieved modernity comparable to Russia in areas like Western-style education, companies, and large-scale industries [02:30:00], they lacked political power. This created a deepening gap and growing conflict between the modernizing elements and the political power, leading to "mutual massacres" [02:37:00]. In essence, the groups modernizing the country were also perceived as "enemies of the state" [02:38:00].

### The Decline of the Crimean Tatars
An example of such historical demographic shifts is the Crimean Tatars. Their population, once spread across the northern Black Sea coast (including much of modern Ukraine and Moldova) [02:48:49], gradually migrated or were cleared by Russia [02:53:23]. Major waves of migration led them to Dobruja (northern Bulgaria, eastern Romania) and then to Turkey [02:53:23]. The Crimea region was one of the last places they held political sovereignty [03:16:00], but their population there has since drastically reduced to less than ten percent [03:26:00].

## The Modern World and Its Challenges

The speaker also touches upon contemporary issues:
*   **NATO and the Ukraine War:** The speaker suggests that NATO's significant defeat in Ukraine is a disaster that threatens the credibility of institutions like NATO and the European Union, making open war seem inevitable [03:59:53]. This perceived inevitability is also linked to the need to address a looming financial crisis in the West, where states are heavily indebted [04:00:40]. A major war could serve as an excuse to default on these unpayable debts [04:00:40].
*   **Military Superiority:** The recent combat in Ukraine exposed weaknesses in Western military technology, such as the US Patriot missile system, which was reportedly defeated by newly developed Russian missiles [03:42:00]. This suggests that purchasing S-400s from Russia might have been a "right step for Turkey" due to the "rotten" quality of American goods [03:59:55].
*   **Vagner PMC's Success:** The speaker highlights the success of the private Russian military company Vagner PMC in Ukraine, which despite having a small staff, "completely destroyed 2 Ukrainian corps" and inflicted massive casualties [03:54:55]. This is presented as an example of a private company defeating an alliance of 31 NATO countries [03:54:55]. The situation in Ukraine is likened to a structure cracking under load, signaling an imminent collapse of the Ukrainian front [03:54:55].
*   **The West's Strategic Overextension:** NATO's current front lines, extending into countries like Poland, Moldova, and Romania, are seen as logistics nightmares due to their distance from main bases [04:04:12]. This strategic overextension, a result of filling power vacuums in the 1990s, means the West has "no choice but to retreat" [04:05:27] against Russia and China, who can deploy troops more easily from their nearby production and population centers [04:05:33]. The speaker fears the end of the Western world as it is known, though the outcome of potential wars is unpredictable [04:06:14].

## Final Thoughts on Political Science and History

The speaker advises against studying political science if one is interested in politics, stating that "political science has nothing to do with politics" [03:11:10]. Instead, for those who "want to be informed about politics," the recommendation is to "read history" and "the real stories of real politicians," as well as novels [03:12:20]. Academia, once a respected field, is now seen as a "very dangerous and terrible civil service world" [03:18:54].

The speaker emphasizes the importance of knowing Ottoman Turkish for Turkish intellectuals interested in history [03:32:32]. Libraries, in the digital age, are largely ornamental, as all information is accessible online [03:32:32].

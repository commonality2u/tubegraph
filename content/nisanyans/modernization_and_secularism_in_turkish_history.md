## Introduction to Modernization and Secularism

Modernization and secularism are key themes in the historical and cultural discourse surrounding Türkiye. It is stated that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk "brought modernization and secularism" to Türkiye, alongside establishing the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:41">[02:27:41]</a>. This discourse often maintains that it is inappropriate to delve into Atatürk's private life due to his significant contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>.

## Ottoman Foundations of Modernization

The concept of modernization, including westernization, has roots in the Ottoman period. During the Tanzimat era, the educated classes of the Ottoman Empire, particularly those aware of the wider world, "unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West," specifically France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This acceptance did not imply abandoning the morality of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>, but acknowledged perceived Western virtues such as integrity, education, respect for women, clean cities, and advancements in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

### Focus on Women's Rights

One of the most significant aspects of [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization and westernization]] was the issue of women's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Progressive Ottoman intellectuals largely believed that women should be educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>, arguing that a nation with ignorant women would suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. Educating girls was seen as a crucial dimension of modernization from the 1840s to the 1850s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. This led to significant institutional changes, such as the establishment of the Girls' Teachers' School (Darülmuallimat) in 1880, the same year as France's first state girls' high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. Later, Istanbul University (Darülfünun) began accepting female students into all faculties by 1920, before the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Women's magazines, published extensively since the 1880s and 1890s, consistently emphasized women's education as essential for a modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

### Limited Class Consciousness

Unlike Western societies where progressive views on class became widespread after the French Revolution, the concept of class was very weak in Ottoman culture until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. Discussions about the rights of the proletarian class, the poor, and peasants only gained traction in Türkiye after the Soviet Revolution in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Atatürk and the Republican Era

### Atatürk's Personal Life and Public Image

The discussion surrounding Atatürk's personal life, particularly his relationships with his adopted daughters and the orphan Abdurrahim, highlights the complexities of his public image. Gossip regarding a "mistress relationship" with his "spiritual adopted daughters" was reportedly known throughout Atatürk's life and mentioned in memoirs, including foreign ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. The question is raised whether it is "right for an adult man, single... to adopt a girl" and keep her in his private suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. The very existence of such gossip is considered a "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>.

The topic of Abdurrahim, an orphaned child Atatürk took with him in Van in 1916, remained a "big taboo" until 10-15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>. Abdurrahim lived with Atatürk on various fronts and in his residence in Istanbul and Çankaya, serving him personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:52">[02:23:52]</a>. However, just before Atatürk married Latife Hanım in late 1922, Abdurrahim was sent away to İzmir and later to Germany for his education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. The fact that Atatürk, the founder of the Republic, had an adopted son who could theoretically be an heir, was largely unknown due to this taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>. The introduction of Abdurrahim into the discourse later served as a defense mechanism against criticisms regarding Atatürk's adopted daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:10">[02:27:10]</a>.

### Atatürk's Character and Political Strategy

Nazım Hikmet's poem about "Tahsim Bey" is used to describe Atatürk, portraying him as a person of "extraordinarily strong personality" who "trusted no one but his soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>. Atatürk is characterized as someone who "betrayed everyone who was close to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>, including close friends and political allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:23">[03:30:23]</a>. He is described as a "victorious and magnificent Gambler," taking "crazy risks" at every political step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:14">[03:34:14]</a>. Adjectives like "sarcastic, belligerent, cunning and dominating" are also used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:39">[03:39:39]</a>.

From a strategic perspective, Atatürk's actions in 1922 are seen as a logical sequence given the need to "re-establish the power of a collapsed state" and "protect your own power and life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:11">[03:08:11]</a>. This involved:
*   Creating "national excitement," even if "fake," in a ruined country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.
*   Mobilizing ordinary citizens with nationalistic narratives while elites pursued Westernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.
*   Taking "deterrent measures against the Kurds" to prevent state disintegration, reflecting a long-standing Ottoman policy to halt territorial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

### Relationship with British Intelligence

A significant point of discussion is Atatürk's alleged relationship with British services, particularly in the early stages of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. It is suggested that the loss of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria in 1918 was a "staged fight" and the result of an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:10">[02:26:10]</a>. Atatürk's coincidental presence in Vienna at the same time as the King of England's brother, followed by his swift return to Istanbul and appointment to the Palestine front, and his subsequent actions to remove German military command, are cited as suspicious events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:45">[02:27:45]</a>. He also maintained close relations with the director of British intelligence in the Ottoman Empire in 1918-1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:42">[02:29:42]</a>.

The British policy aimed to eliminate Enver and his team, keep France and Russia out of Türkiye, and establish a modern Turkish state with good relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:05">[02:30:05]</a>. Atatürk fit this framework perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a>.

## Critiques of Kemalism and Turkish Nationalism

The main issue is not with Mustafa Kemal himself, but with his "disciples," or the contemporary problem of the Kemalist icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51">[02:39:51]</a>. This icon is seen as "contemporary Turkish racism and the state worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:17">[02:40:17]</a>, symbolizing a "moral blindness that a priori justifies all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:36">[02:40:36]</a>.

The "semi-educated and cheap modernity-polished classes of Türkiye" are seen as using this icon to "spew hatred and complexes against the outside world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>. This has led to their marginalization in the political arena and reliance on state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:22">[02:41:22]</a>.

[[history_and_nationalism_in_trkiye | Turkish nationalism]], particularly Kemalist nationalism, is described as a "pathology specific to Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:34">[02:41:34]</a>, embodying a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:39">[02:41:39]</a>. The Kemalist sect verbally rejects Islam but represents the "arrogance of the nation, which is the deepest and most malignant dimension of historical Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>. Their societal theory is summarized as "We conquered, Therefore, we are right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:08">[02:42:08]</a>, leading to an inability to understand or emotionally connect with neighboring peoples or subjects of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:17">[02:42:17]</a>. This "ignorance bordering on stupidity" is particularly evident on the Kurdish issue, considered Türkiye's most important contemporary issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:30">[02:42:30]</a>.

It is argued that until the "Kemalism disease" is overcome, "the cause of civilization in Türkiye" is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:29">[02:43:29]</a>. This perspective has been consistently maintained since the speaker's middle and high school years, reflected in works like the "Wrong Cumhuriyet" book published in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:50">[02:43:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_modernization_in_turkey | Challenges of Modernization in Turkey]]

The attempted assimilation policy against the Kurds is considered a "terrible defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:36">[03:33:36]</a>. The turning point was around 1980-83, or even earlier in the 1960s, when Kurds began attending university, causing the assimilation project to "explode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:02">[03:34:02]</a>. The "dynamism of the Kurdish society" and demographic balance indicate that "the Turks were defeated in this regard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>. This defeat has not yet been grasped by the Turkish side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:17">[03:35:17]</a>, but they will eventually face it. It is predicted that the Kurdish victory will involve integration into the system and taking it over from within, leading to a new balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:57">[03:35:57]</a>.

The discussion highlights the ongoing tension between a deeply ingrained nationalistic and state-worshipping ideology (Kemalism) and the evolving [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | social and sociological changes in Turkey]], particularly regarding ethnic and cultural identities, reflecting [[continuity_and_change_in_turkish_history | continuity and change in Turkish history]].

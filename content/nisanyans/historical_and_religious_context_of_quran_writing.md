The dating and [[history_of_quran_codification|codification of the Quranic text]] are subjects obscured by many fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Claims about a 1400-year-old Quran being ninety-nine and a half percent similar to modern copies are questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Timing of Quranic Compilation

There is no serious data indicating how much of the Quran was written down before 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad, or in what script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Information suggesting otherwise is considered a series of fallacies and half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The claim that a commission was established during Muhammad's time and the period following him, under Hz. Osman, to write down the Quran, is believed to have been fabricated approximately 180 years after the event, during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This fabrication addressed the public's unease about the Quran not being written down until long after Muhammad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

> Scientific and objective information suggests the Quran was [[compilation_of_the_quran_after_muhammad|compiled around 680 during the time of the Umayyads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Evolution of Arabic Script

The Arabic script, as it is known today, was first codified in the 680s, during the time of the Caliph Abd al-Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This [[origins_of_the_arabic_script|codification of Arabic script]] was done for the purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

In the earlier period, during Muhammad's time and for 60 years thereafter, existing Arabic script was limited to graffiti or short scribbles of three to five words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It lacked dots or vowel movements, rendering it a distorted version primarily useful for taking notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. There were no literary works or formal letters written in Arabic at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The idea that Arabic, a tribal language, could be a written language did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The prevalent written language in the Middle East at that time, akin to Latin in its high-level use, was Syriac script, used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Transmission and Standardization

Before its compilation, the Quran was transmitted orally, with people memorizing and reciting the verses in mosques every Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The authenticity of this oral transmission, while seen as divine, cannot be fully verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

When the Quran reached the stage of being written down, different traditions and versions existed in various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These differing accounts were silenced by the order of Hajjaj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A single text was then created, aligned with the [[influence_of_political_power_on_quranic_text|political interests of the common Umayyad State]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Critique of European Immigration Policy and Greek Coast Guard Actions

A significant incident that highlighted concerns about [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | immigration]] policy in Europe involved the sinking of a migrant boat south of Greece, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. The Western press was accused of attempting to cover up the details of this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

### The Greek Coast Guard Incident

Survivors of the sinking boat were reportedly taken to a concentration camp where they were prevented from meeting with outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. A Syrian dentist among the survivors recounted that his family died in the hospital where he was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

The Greek coast guard reportedly visited the boat three times:
*   On their first visit, they asked if assistance was needed, then "showed off and made fun of each other and left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.
*   They returned hours later, and the same behavior occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.
*   During their third visit, they "tied a rope and started pulling the boat, but while pulling, they made a sudden move and sank the ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. It was suggested that they "always do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

The boat reportedly had 750 people on board, who were counted before departure, and no more were allowed to board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. All women and children were placed in the hold, and all of them died in the sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. The perceived hypocrisy surrounding this incident was described as "sickening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.

### Debate on Europe's Response to Immigration

There is an argument that migrants are "coming to invade Europe" and "take over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. The question of whether it is "legitimate for Europe to protect itself" and control [[immigration_trends_in_the_united_states_and_europe | migration]] to its lands is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.

It was suggested that if European authorities were to "manfully" and openly declare their intention to sink caught ships and not save anyone, migration would cease "as if with a knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. This controversial approach was argued to be "more humane" than current methods, as it would stop migration and potentially lead to a lower total number of deaths by deterring people from attempting such crossings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the "horrific hypocrisy and sleaze" of the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

### Treatment of Rescuers

Experiences from Samos, specifically concerning the [[deportation_from_greece_and_its_impact | Greek Islands]] and the European Union, highlight further issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. An international police organization called Fantex, under German administration, took over the administration on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. This led to a situation where arresting those who attempted to rescue drowning migrants was considered an achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

An example cited involved Turkish individuals on a blue cruise who rescued two people from a sinking inflatable boat and brought them to a Greek port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. They were immediately detained, went to court after six months, and were found "involved in human trafficking," spending six months in prison for saving two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. This was condemned as "despicable" and "filthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. The behavior of the Greek police under German administration was criticized, implying they "turned into animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. The speaker asserts that the "biggest problem of the modern world is honor," which is lacking due to a lack of education on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

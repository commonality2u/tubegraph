The government in China is described as communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. The speaker rejects the label of "fascist" for China's governance model, questioning its applicability in the Chinese context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

## Characteristics and Achievements

China's governance model is characterized as:
*   Successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.
*   Based on a very broad social consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   A regime that "works well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

Over 30 years, this model has transformed China from "terrible poverty to the number one economic power in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. This transformation was reportedly managed "almost without any bloodshed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>, achieved through compromise and "always looking for the middle way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

The governance prioritizes the welfare of society in all areas, including economic prosperity, creating a comfortable and beautiful living environment, and preserving and developing cultural characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.

The speaker states a personal inability to understand "in what sense this can be called fascist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>, reinforcing the rejection of this label in relation to [[the_concept_of_dictatorship | China's governance]].

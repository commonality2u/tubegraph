The Balkans, particularly Albania and Greece, offer significant insights into the complex interplay of history, identity, and modern geopolitical dynamics.

## Albania: A Unique National Identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>

Albania, a neighbor often misunderstood, presents a unique case in the Balkan region regarding national identity and religious affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Unlike surrounding countries like North Macedonia and Kosovo, where Albanians are almost entirely Sunni Muslim, Albania itself exhibits a deeply [[historical_perspectives_on_nationalism_and_identity | divided nation]] in terms of religion and sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

While a little more than half of the population is Muslim, this generalization is insufficient. It includes Sunni Muslims in the north and Bektashi Muslims in the south, who are considered "two separate religions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Additionally, there is a significant Orthodox Christian population, particularly in Southern Albania, influenced by Greek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

Notably, in Albania, religious distinction has largely ceased to be the primary element of identity, a situation unparalleled in the broader Balkan, Anatolian, or Middle Eastern geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Mixed marriages are extremely common, and Christians and Muslims are buried side-by-side in cemeteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:56]</a>.

This unique cohesion is attributed significantly to the Enver Hoxha regime (1944-1980s), which banned all religions and declared atheism as the state religion from the 1960s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Prior to this, during the Kingdom period before World War II, a strong secularism policy aimed at creating a single Albanian nation was also in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. For about a century, there has been a concerted effort to overcome religious differences and forge a common national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

### Albanian Kingdom and its Link to Türkiye

Albania was a kingdom for a period, ruled by King Zog I (Ahmet Zogu), who served as prime minister before declaring himself King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Interestingly, Ahmet Zogu was a feudal lord from Northern Albania and a graduate of Galatasaray High School in Istanbul, knowing perfect Istanbul Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Understanding Albanian history is crucial for comprehending 20th-century events in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. After 1878, it became clear that the [[historical_conflicts_and_events_in_the_ottoman_empire_and_greece | Ottoman Empire]] would lose Rumelia (the Balkans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

#### The Balkan Wars and "Great Albania"

The concept of establishing a "reserve Turkey" in the form of an Albanian state, primarily in the Muslim-majority western part of the Balkan peninsula, was a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. This idea of a "Turkish Albanian State" or "Muslim Albanian State" covering a large area, including all of today's Kosovo and half of North Macedonia, was actively on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

The possibility of a unified, strong Albania became very serious in 1912, as Albanians were in rebellion from 1910 onwards, seeking independence from the Ottoman state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This development became a "burning underlying reason" for the Balkan War in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. In response, Serbia and Greece formed an alliance and attacked, significantly reducing the size of Albania with European help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. The main issue of 1912 was whether a powerful Albanian Muslim state would emerge or if Albania would be fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

## Modern Geopolitics and the Balkans

The [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | impact of historical events]] continues to shape modern geopolitics, including the Balkans.

### The Rise of Neoconservatism in US Foreign Policy

A significant development impacting global politics, including the Balkans, is the rise of neoconservatism in American foreign policy. This movement gained influence in the academic world and journals in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>. Prominent in the magazine "Commentary," many of its writers were former Marxists and Trotskyists who evolved into a more radical "Neo Imperialist" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.

Their influence grew in the late 1990s and became dominant in US internal and external security policy after the 2001 Twin Towers attack, especially under George W. Bush's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. Figures like Kristol dominated the American Foreign Ministry and later the Pentagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. Until 2016, they were aligned with the Republican Party, but shifted to the Democratic Party after Donald Trump's takeover, now "running the country, running the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.

Their ideology is characterized by:
*   Ignorance, prejudice, and arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>.
*   The belief that America must dominate the world, using a moral discourse of "democracy, human rights, and freedom" as propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>.
*   Categorical hostility towards [[cultural_and_societal_influences_in_history_and_modernday_politics | Russia]], aiming for its disintegration and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. This stems from a view that Russia is an enemy to be defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

This approach contrasts sharply with pre-1980 American foreign policy, which was characterized by a deeply intellectual cadre with strong historical and diplomatic knowledge, avoiding the "cowboyism" seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. The shift is partly attributed to a generational change, with those graduating after 1968 lacking moral basis and historical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>.

Russia, despite its criticisms, is considered a civilized country integral to Western civilization, known for figures like Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>. The neocon hostility is seen as irrational, driven by a need for an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. Russia's unprecedented abandonment of its empire in 1991, allowing Eastern European countries to pursue integration with Europe, was a move for a peaceful, complementary future between resource-rich Russia and capital/population-rich Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:17:00">[38:17:00]</a>. However, American "cowboys" perceive this potential unity as a threat and seek to destroy Russia, as demonstrated by interventions in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>.

### Greece's Political Landscape and European Influence

[[historical_conflicts_and_events_in_the_ottoman_empire_and_greece | Greece]]'s experience with Alexis Tsipras highlights the limitations of national political leadership within a globalized framework. Tsipras came to power with radical promises, challenging the European Union and advocating for Greece to stand up against its demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>. He was elected as a communist and atheist in a non-secular country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:00">[49:37:00]</a>.

Upon taking office, Tsipras held a referendum asking Greeks whether to pay their debts to the European Union, which resulted in an overwhelming "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:04:00">[50:04:00]</a>. However, Brussels effectively disregarded the referendum, compelling Tsipras to comply with its demands, after which he continued his power as a "lapdog" for four to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>. This exemplifies the nature of power in today's world, where elected politicians have limited roles in key matters.

### The Limits of Political Leadership in Modern States

Today's democratic regimes, which are seen as "95% fraud," severely limit the power of elected officials in vital policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>.
1.  **Security Institutions**: Military, police, and intelligence agencies are largely autonomous, with guaranteed budgets and non-transparent decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Monetary Policies**: Central banks and financial institutions operate independently, capable of destabilizing a country if governments deviate from accepted policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>.
3.  **International Relations**: Countries are intensely interconnected, limiting independent policy-making in areas like health, trade, and even culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>.

In this context, the role of political leaders is largely to "make a society feel good" rather than having significant managerial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>. The notion of "separation of powers" is seen as a historical relic, as professional bureaucracy and unaccountable institutions control vast resources and dictate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>. This structure leaves little room for genuine change, even if public sentiment demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.

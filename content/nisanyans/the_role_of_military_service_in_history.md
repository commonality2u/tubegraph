The concept and implementation of military service have profoundly shaped states and societies throughout history. Its evolution from professional armies to mass conscription and back again reflects changing political, social, and economic landscapes.

## Pre-Modern Military Structures

Before the modern era, states exhibited various forms of military organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **City-States**: In entities composed of a city and its controlled provincial area, a strong sense of solidarity and loyalty to the city-state prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Citizens would sacrifice themselves for the honor of their city, often making decisions through semi-democratic or oligarchic assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Kingdoms and Empires**: Larger states and monarchies were typically based on loyalty to a sovereign dynasty rather than a national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. People felt indebted to the dynasty for their livelihood and were prepared to sacrifice their lives for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Religious affiliation also played a significant role in fostering loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Professional Soldiers**: For much of history, military service was a profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Soldiers, like the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire, pursued it for life, often inheriting the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This profession offered income, spoils from war, and tax exemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

## The Rise of Modern Compulsory Military Service

The concept of a large state based on nationality and mass conscription is a modern phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It emerged in 1792 with the French Revolutionary regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### French Revolution and its Spread
Facing a coalition of European states attempting to overthrow it, the French Revolutionary regime introduced compulsory military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This radical innovation required every citizen to join the army upon the state's call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This shift necessitated citizens feeling the state was "their state," leading to the idea that the governing cadres represented "the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This new military order, tied to the concept of the Republic and national identity, spread rapidly after 1800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

The successes of [[historical_parallels_and_lessons_from_the_napoleonic_wars | Napoleon's armies]], built on this model, compelled other nations like Prussia and other German principalities to adopt general military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This led to the demand for new states built on national identity, as seen in Germany with its mosaic of independent kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### Ottoman Empire's Adaptation and Consequences
The [[analysis_of_historical_military_regimes_in_Turkey_and_their_outcomes | Ottoman Empire]] began to adopt a modern type of army gathered from the people around 1820, during the time of Napoleon and Sultan Selim, though it faced initial reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Under Sultan Mahmud II from 1826 onwards, the recruitment of non-professional individuals into the army for a certain period became a defining policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

This shift necessitated a [[political_events_and_military_education_in_turkey | population administration]] and census, initially tracking only men for conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This change coincided with the rise of nationalism in Ottoman culture, a concept previously unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

A critical consequence in multi-ethnic empires like the Ottoman Empire was the rise of minority nationalisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. If military service was tied to the identity of a dominant nation, minority communities questioned their loyalty, leading to demands for their own states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This contributed to the Ottoman Empire's disintegration, with Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Arabs, and Armenians seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

Under [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islamic law]], non-Muslims were forbidden to carry weapons or command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. As compulsory military service was introduced for Muslims, non-Muslims were required to pay a large fee to be exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. This policy, while seemingly a privilege, led to the economic marginalization of Muslims who were constantly at war, unable to establish stable businesses or manage their fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. Conversely, non-Muslims, by paying the fee, focused on accumulating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This disparity eventually fueled animosity and led to the plundering of non-Muslim properties by some Turkish groups, which ultimately contributed to the founding of the national state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. This entire process is seen as a human tragedy resulting from the administration's "stupid decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## Decline of Compulsory Military Service and Future Implications

In the last 10-20 years, compulsory general military service has been disappearing worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. While some countries, like Turkey, still have it, its seriousness has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Western countries rarely maintain a truly impactful compulsory military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

The trend is towards professional armies that require great expertise, technical knowledge, and specialized equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Military service is becoming a profession or an economic benefit for certain groups, rather than a civic duty tied to national loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This shift is rapidly eroding the sense of nationalism and the willingness to sacrifice one's life for the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

In this changing landscape, the speaker speculates that "strong core organizations based on force of arms, small organizations whose members are loyal to each other to death and their federations" will become the main actors of the coming era, as observed in Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This transition is seen as potentially leading to prolonged and deep anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

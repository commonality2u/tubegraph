A scientific conference, part of a "male project" in Şirince, was organized, starting on July 9th and lasting for five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Including arrival and departure, participants would spend six days in Şirince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These events are described as "very enjoyable" and "enriching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The website address for those interested was also shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Focus on Turkology and Linguistics

The conference specifically invited Marsel Erdallı, who is noted as a "very good Turkologist" with "valuable studies on the history of Turkish and Asian Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Additionally, Kıraç Mardirosan, an academic from Germany who authored the etymological dictionary of Armenian, was also invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This suggests a focus on linguistic studies, including aspects of [[historical_and_linguistic_reflections_on_the_turkish_language | Turkish language]] history and related regional languages.

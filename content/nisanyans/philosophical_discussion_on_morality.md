Moral, ethical, and right-wrong judgments are questioned as personal conventions or contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. The inquiry extends to whether morality and right-wrong distinctions would exist in a one-person world and the nature of evil, particularly if it could be based on consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

## Human Nature and Morality
Humans, as mammals, possess highly developed species behaviors that have evolved over millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. These "factory settings" inform people's basic moral judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

Basic moral judgments about what is moral and immoral have been consistently similar across all societies throughout history, from primitive tribes to the Roman Empire, and among Muslims and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. Behaviors considered appreciable or despicable are largely similar globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

While a set of universal moral rules exists, there are also conventional rules that distinguish human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. However, labeling universal rules as mere "conventions" is deemed incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. Some moral behaviors are specific to a particular society, serving as its hallmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## Social Cooperation and Trust
Humans always live in society, and even with reduced educational norms, they exhibit common moral and ethical attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. The idea that people would "roll in the mud like pigs" without divine guidance is rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

Humans have a basic biological obligation: the indispensable need to care for their young, who require the longest care among all mammals—at least two years of parental care for survival, and protection until ages six, seven, or eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. Abandoning children would lead to the extinction of the human race within one or two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. This implies an extremely strong instinct to protect children against all dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.

Humans possess a unique capacity for social cooperation and alliances, facilitated by a highly developed language tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. For such cooperation to function, people must trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. Therefore, behaviors that break trust—such as not keeping one's word or harming a friend—have universally been considered "terribly bad" and deserving of severe consequences, including death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. This is not a matter of convention or agreement but an inherent form of animal behavior, akin to a cat licking itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. The need for trust is innate, evident even in young children's reactions to broken promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.

## Critique of Moral Theories
Two conflicting moral theories are dismissed:
1.  **Religious Narrative**: The idea that people are moral only because they fear hell and desire heaven, or because of divine guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>, is described as "indescribably [ __ ]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.
2.  **Kantian Theory**: The notion that people arrived at moral conclusions through pure thought, such as the social contract or "do not do to others what you do not want done to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>, is considered "complete nonsense" and a "very primitive way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>.

Instead, basic moral behaviors and the inner feeling of conscience—knowing what is right or wrong—are seen as natural animal instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

## Reason and Belief
The relationship between reason and belief, particularly in a non-religious context, is explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

### Defining Belief
Belief is defined as a "weak degree of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. If one says, "I believe it is pink," it implies a lack of definitive knowledge, a guess, or a desire for it to be true due to insufficient information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>. Knowledge, conversely, is something subjectively perceived as objectively existing and certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>. When one says, "I believe," it is an admission of not knowing, a subjective and "watered down" form of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.

### The Role of Belief in Difficult Situations
The need for belief increases when attempting "impossible things" because if something were truly known, it would not be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. When facing tasks for which there is no established procedure or manual, and knowledge is insufficient, people "have no choice but to take refuge in belief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>. If one feels emotionally compelled to act on an unknown subject, actions are based on belief, not knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>.

### Belief vs. Reason as Power
Belief is likely a stronger source of power in society than reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>. Knowledge limits people by indicating which behaviors are unsupported or unfounded, preventing them from acting on unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. Belief, however, opens up "horizons forever" by allowing one to "jump into the darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. Knowledge is light, while belief is what enables action when light is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.

## Enlightened vs. Heroic People
People who "worship the truth" are characterized as critical and questioning individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. They scrutinize common societal acceptances through objective criteria or criteria they hope to be objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>. Such intellectuals, or "Voltaires," who make it their mission to filter societal norms through reason and knowledge, cannot be leaders of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

To be a societal leader, one must share the feelings and judgments of the society and be able to rally millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. A "Voltaire" attempting to be a "Napoleon" would pause, reflect, and admit to being wrong, which is the "glory of being a Voltaire"—the ability to question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.# [[Philosophical and ethical considerations | Philosophical Discussion on Morality]]

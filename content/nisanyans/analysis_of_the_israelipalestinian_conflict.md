This article examines various aspects of the [[palestinianisraeli_conflict | Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], including its current state, historical context, moral dimensions, and geopolitical implications.

## Current Situation and Initial Observations

A recent terrorist drone attack on the Kremlin led to internet disruptions near the Kremlin, affecting communication during a broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Despite Russia being at war, normal life continues with concerts, cinemas, and theaters full, and no signs of fear or tension observed in the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Police and soldiers are not frequently seen on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Moral and Historical Context of the Conflict

The speaker addresses the [[the_current_state_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict | Israel-Palestine conflict]] by describing Gaza as an "open-air concentration camp" where people have been imprisoned, starved, and bombed for 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Inhabitants cannot travel outside easily and face humiliating treatment when attempting to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Organizing a rock festival for peace near this "ghetto" is characterized as "shamelessness, cowardice and dishonesty" and "psychopathic behavior," akin to Nazi officers having fun while people in Auschwitz were humiliated and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Historically, the speaker held the opinion that Israel had a stronger claim, but this view shifted after the "first gas bombardment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Objectively, the Palestinian claim to rights is considered "a little stronger" than Israel's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The speaker acknowledges Israel's founding with "great idealism and great effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, Israel has continued an "Apar regime, a regime of oppression and tyranny" for 70 years without significant effort to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:02]</a>.

The act of "taking sides in the Israel-Palestine War" is deemed as unwise as taking sides in a fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The attitude of the Western press and Turkish educated classes, which directly assume responsibility in recent events, is described as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. While the justification for the slaughter of 100 people is debatable, the speaker criticizes the prevalent attitude, especially in TÃ¼rkiye, of "rabid hostility towards Arabs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This attitude legitimizes any action by Israel, including bombing and destroying, because "Palestinians have committed oppression and slaughtered some women like sheep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Such a stance is considered "despicable" and "dishonorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Israel has bombed the imprisoned population of Gaza three times a year for 17 years, indiscriminately targeting civilians, women, children, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The Israeli Defense Minister's statement that "These people are not human, they are animals" and intentions to destroy them, cut off electricity, food, and water supplies are compared to the actions of the German occupation force in Vagos in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A nation that has based its existence on revenge for oppression is now finding it "right to oppress in the same way, with the same discourse and with the same mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Realpolitik and Strategic Considerations

From a realpolitik perspective, two possibilities are considered regarding the recent attack:
1.  **Israel's Unawareness/Blind Eye**: Israel was completely unaware of an "extremely risky and multi-dimensional operation" involving hundreds or thousands of people, showing no reaction when the border was crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This is seen as "not normal" or "not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
2.  **Israel's Deliberate Action/Design**: The question arises whether Israel either organized this attack itself or "turned a blind eye to it," waiting and ensuring the attack occurred without immediate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This scenario suggests Israel sought to "solve the Palestinian problem," or "Gaza problem fundamentally," perhaps even aiming for a "final solution" by cutting off gas, electricity, water, and food, which would lead to death within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This possibility is widely discussed among commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The counter-argument to the second possibility is that such an attack, resulting in hundreds of slaughtered civilians and captured soldiers, would be unacceptable for Israel and highly risky, regardless of the purpose of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### Potential Escalation and Precedents

If the current conflict escalates into a chain attack involving Hamas, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Syria opening a Northern front, it could reach "very serious dimensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This could lead to "other kinds of ethnic cleansing" beyond the planned cleansing of Gaza's people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

A precedent for this is the ethnic cleansing operation in Nagorno-Karabakh a month prior, where 100,000 people were exiled from their homeland under the threat of death, with no international intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This was a "systematic and large-scale ethnic cleansing" for the first time since the two World Wars (excluding the Yugoslavia War), and its acceptance by the world creates a dangerous precedent, implying that in 2023, countries can invade and kidnap people without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

The speaker warns that if the people of Palestine/Gaza are ethnically cleansed, the people of Israel might face the same fate in the future, which has been a "nightmare and fear" for Israelis since 1947-1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. This fear is the "basic logic behind Israel's domestic and foreign policy," as it perceives itself as a "small country surrounded by enemies" whose long-term goal is to "throw the Israeli people into the sea and destroy them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Israel's response is to fight a "War of Existence and Absence," where "everything is permissible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### Challenges to Israel's Sustainability

Despite Israel's claim of existential war, the speaker argues that Israel has not acted rationally since its founding in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Instead of fostering mutual interests and compromise with neighbors, Israel has chosen to "show its power by getting the [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | United States]] behind it and threatening those against it with death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

This policy overlooks several fundamental contradictions:
1.  **Economic Unsustainability**: Israel is not economically sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. It has lived on more than a trillion dollars of [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | American support]] since its establishment and continues to receive huge amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. It has not managed to stand on its own feet economically for 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
2.  **Diplomatic/Strategic Unsustainability**: Israel has made the "Islamic world, which exceeds 1.5 billion, its enemies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. With a population of 7.5 million, it is surrounded by an Arab and Islamic world 200 times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. While Israel has technological superiority and has defeated stronger countries in past wars, the Arabs are also developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. A key question is how long [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | America]] can continue to bear this burden of unconditional support, especially if its military and economic power diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
3.  **Population Structure and Labor**: Israel's population is largely middle class or higher, with a high level of education and welfare, lacking a "working class" or "peasant class" to exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Thus, it relies on Palestinians for employment, a "kind of slave labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Unlike modern capitalist societies where workers are granted citizenship rights and ideological affiliation, Israel maintains a system where the working class (Palestinians) are not citizens or are second-class citizens, without an emotional connection to the state's discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This situation is compared to Gulf emirates using foreign labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

### Solutions and Future Outlook

Most countries (excluding [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | America]] and the EU), including China, Russia, and Turkey, advocate for a two-state solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. While legally reasonable, this solution is deemed impractical because Israelis need Palestinians for labor, and Palestinians need Israelis as employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

The speaker proposes a single state where all inhabitants, including Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews, have equal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. However, Israel's unique founding conditions prevent it from achieving this modern state order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. The current system, with a ruling class and a deprived lower class based on religious and ethnic difference, is compared to Ottoman society before the 19th century where non-Muslims were treated as "humiliated dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. This order is deemed unsustainable in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

The speaker predicts a "very strong possibility" of Israel disappearing, akin to the Crusader Kingdom of Israel which lasted 88-89 years in the same geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. A potential scenario for this outcome involves Iran and Saudi Arabia uniting against Israel, which would make Israel's position indefensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. The speaker estimates a 9/10 advantage for Iran in an [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | America-Iran war]] if nuclear weapons are not used, citing America's defeat in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

### Broader Geopolitical Implications

The possibility of a serious global war (not necessarily a "World War III" in the traditional sense) is given a 51% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. The speaker highlights new nuclear technologies and missile systems (like those announced by Putin) that could "turn everything upside down" in nuclear strategy, making traditional defense obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. The current Western leadership is characterized as "psychopaths" who might initiate such a war if facing a complete economic impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. NATO, the [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | United States]], and the EU are seen as "cornered very badly" and on the verge of destruction, making them dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## TÃ¼rkiye's Position

TÃ¼rkiye's foreign policy since 2014 has desperately sought to avoid involvement in potential major conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. As a NATO member, TÃ¼rkiye faces "heavy pressure" to intervene on the NATO front in a war between Russia and the West, or Iran and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. TÃ¼rkiye's efforts to stay out of such conflicts are considered a "wise effort" that should be supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. If successful, the current ruling cadre should be thanked for "preventing our children from dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

Regarding Azerbaijan-Israel relations, the speaker notes a simple relationship: Azerbaijan has oil, which Israel needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. Additionally, the hostility between Azerbaijan and Iran suits Israel, which "finds it right to pursue a policy of hostility towards Iran that goes far beyond being rational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Foreign relations today also involve "special interests" and "bribery," with leaders potentially selling out their countries for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. TÃ¼rkiye follows an "extremely cautious policy regarding Israel" and will not participate in the Arab conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. Therefore, relations with Azerbaijan are unlikely to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. The speaker anticipates a rapid softening of TÃ¼rkiye-Armenia and Azerbaijan-Armenia relations after the resolution of the Karabakh issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

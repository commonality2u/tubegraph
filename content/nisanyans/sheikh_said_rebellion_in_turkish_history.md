The **Sheikh Said Rebellion** was a significant [[turkish_historical_events | historical political movement]] and the last major Kurdish rebellion in Turkey, occurring in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:16">[02:55:16]</a>. It is a complex event with multiple interpretations and significant consequences for the region.

### Overview of Sheikh Said

Sheikh Said is viewed differently by various segments of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:13">[02:52:13]</a>. For a large portion of Turkish society (approximately one-quarter to one-fifth of the population), he is considered a national hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:24">[02:52:24]</a>. Among many Kurds, he is seen as a respectable figure who fought for his faith and nation, even if he was ultimately defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Despite common misconceptions, Sheikh Said was not an "ignorant village imam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:05">[03:11:05]</a>. He was a prominent aristocrat from one of the most prestigious families in the Kurdish region, with a lineage of influential individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>. He was a grandson of Sheikh Ali Sepin, a key figure in the Naqshbandi organization in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:24">[04:00:24]</a>. His family and relatives held significant power and influence, with many establishing separate lodges (tekke) in various districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:53">[04:05:53]</a>.

### Suppression and Aftermath

The suppression of the Sheikh Said rebellion was marked by extreme brutality and cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:07">[02:58:07]</a>. Sheikh Said himself, along with many of his relatives, was executed publicly in Diyarbakır square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:43">[02:57:43]</a>. Tens of thousands of people were killed, villages were burned, and the entire Kurdish region experienced a period of severe oppression and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:07">[02:58:07]</a>.

The new Turkish regime in 1925 sought to send a clear message of its authority and show that it would be even more ruthless than the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:26">[02:58:26]</a>. From a moral standpoint, it is argued that one should never side with the oppressor when discussing such events, regardless of the rebel's justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

### Historical Context and Causes

The rebellion's roots can be traced to several [[Historical continuity in Turkey | historical continuity in Turkey]] and [[Political changes in Turkey | political changes in Turkey]] in the region:

*   **Kurdish Principalities (16th - early 19th Century)**: Until the first quarter of the 19th century, the eastern provinces, particularly east of the Euphrates, were governed by Kurdish principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:55">[03:15:55]</a>. These beyliks (e.g., Hakkari, Botan, Bitlis) operated as de facto independent states, collecting their own taxes and maintaining their own armies, while theoretically paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:28">[03:22:28]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Centralization Efforts**: During the reign of Mahmud I, the Ottoman Empire systematically dismantled these principalities in the 19th century, aiming to establish direct central state authority through appointed governors and mutasarrıfs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:54">[03:39:54]</a>. This led to a period of significant chaos and anarchy in the Kurdish regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:46">[03:41:46]</a>.
*   **Rise of Naqshbandi Sheikhs**: In the mid-19th century (1850s-1870s), a new phenomenon emerged as religious students of Mevlana Halid, a Baghdad Naqshbandi saint, began establishing increasing influence and authority in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. Prominent figures included Sheikh Ali Set in Palu, Sheikh Sibghatullah Arvasi in Hizan, and Taha Ari in Semdinli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:53">[03:40:53]</a>. These Naqshbandi sheikhs established a vast network of lodges, often seizing church and monastery properties, increasing both their spiritual and economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:42">[03:48:42]</a>. Sultan Abdulhamid actively supported them to re-establish Ottoman sovereignty in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   Interestingly, a significant number of Armenian villagers reportedly supported this new phenomenon against traditional church authority and converted to Islam, paying homage to these Kurdish sheikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:05">[03:59:05]</a>. This led to radical demographic transformations in areas like Hizan and Mutki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:51">[03:59:51]</a>.

### Motivations for the Rebellion

The Naqshbandi sheikhs, who had built their power with the support of the Ottoman Empire, felt a profound sense of betrayal with the establishment of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:24">[04:18:24]</a>. They saw unknown district governors and captains from the new regime arriving to inform them that their era was over and they held no power in the new Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:50">[04:19:50]</a>. This perceived betrayal served as a primary catalyst for their rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:03">[04:22:03]</a>.

### Narratives and Interpretations

Several narratives exist regarding the Sheikh Said rebellion:
*   **Kurdish National Movement**: Some view Sheikh Said as the leader of the Kurdish national movement and awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.
*   **British Provocation**: Another narrative suggests that the British provoked the Kurds to revolt in an attempt to overthrow the new Turkish regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:26">[03:14:26]</a>.
*   **Religious Bigotry**: A third narrative dismisses the rebels as bigots who revolted purely for Sharia law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:38">[03:14:38]</a>.

A more nuanced perspective suggests analyzing the event from the viewpoint of the Naqshbandi sheikhs who felt their established power, built under the Ottoman system, was being unjustly stripped away by the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:14">[04:12:14]</a>.

### Paradoxical Alliance

The 1925 rebellion is also theorized to have involved a unification of two historically antagonistic groups:
*   **Modern Kurdish National Movement**: This movement gained momentum with the Republic's establishment, centered in Syria and led by figures like the Bedirhan brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Its leaders were often descendants of the old Kurdish aristocracy (Beys and Mirs) and embraced modern nationalist and modernization ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:18">[04:23:18]</a>.
*   **Naqshbandi Sheikhs' Religious Movement**: Represented by Sheikh Said and others, this movement was rooted in religious and traditional authority.

While it is believed that various meetings occurred between these two groups, their historical enmity makes their alleged unification paradoxical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:43">[04:33:43]</a>. It's argued that if they had been successful, their differing political and social values would likely have led to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:31">[04:36:31]</a>.

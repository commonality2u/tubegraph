Albania, a neighboring country, has been visited three times in a year and a half, leading to a growing appreciation for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Initially, there were prejudices against Tirana, viewing it as a gloomy city permeated by the communist regime's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, it has been discovered to be a large, complex, multi-dimensional, and crowded metropolis with modern and wealthy neighborhoods, a vibrant bazaar, and an abundance of cafes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This deeper engagement with Albania has led to new [[observations_on_travel_and_cultural_insights_about_albania | observations on travel and cultural insights]].

## Religious and Cultural Dynamics

While Albanians in surrounding countries like Macedonia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro are predominantly Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, Albania itself presents a unique religious landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Albanian nation is notably "divided into religions and sects in a way that can be called insoluble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

More than half of the population is Muslim, but this group is not homogenous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. There are Sunni Muslims in the north and Bektashi Muslims in the south, which are considered distinct religions in terms of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Additionally, there is a significant Orthodox Christian population, approximately 25%, primarily in Southern Albania, influenced by Greek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Unique Identity Formation

A striking aspect of Albanian society is that religious distinction has "ceased to be the main and determining element of identity, or it has never been like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This situation is described as unparalleled in the broader Balkan, Anatolian, Middle Eastern, and Caucasus regions, where religion typically serves as the fundamental factor defining a person's identity and often fuels animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In contrast, Albania has "somehow managed to overcome this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

This unique integration is evident in mixed marriages, which are "extremely common" in families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, individuals with Muslim names like Muhammad may have Christian graves, or Christians and Muslims are buried side by side in cemeteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This level of religious harmony is considered a "great success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Historical Transformation and Secularism

The historical transformation of Albanian identity is largely attributed to deliberate state policies.

### Enver Hoxha Regime
The Enver Hoxha regime, which dominated Albania from 1944 to the 1980s, played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. From the 1960s onwards, the regime, characterized as a "strange oppression and police state," banned all religions and closed all places of worship, declaring atheism as the state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Pre-WWII Secularism
However, the push for a unified Albanian nation and strong secularism predates Hoxha. A "very strong secularism policy" and an "effort to create a single Albanian nation" were already in place during the Kingdom period before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This sustained effort over approximately 100 years aimed to overcome religious differences and establish a common national identity, and it appears to have been successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Visit to a Bektashi Lodge
A notable experience for understanding Albania's unique religious landscape was a visit to a Bektashi lodge in the very south, near the Greek border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This "Melani Tekkesi" (lodge) is not mentioned in tourist sources and is difficult to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The term "Melani" sparked curiosity about a possible connection to "Melamilik," a radical moral theory in Islamic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

Melamilik, a movement of thought from the 12th or 13th centuries, is described as the "most radical moral theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Its core idea is that overt virtue can be a form of self-aggrandizement, aiming to humiliate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. True virtue, in this philosophy, is achieved through being condemned and blamed, even through humiliation or committing a "crime" to break the ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This perspective views being a "sinner" as the only way to open the ego, a "terrible radicalism" that challenges all moral theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Albanian History and the Ottoman Empire

Understanding Albania's history is crucial for comprehending certain 20th-century events in [[changing_religious_and_cultural_dynamics_in_turkey | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. After 1878, it became clear that the Ottoman Empire would lose Rumelia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. A key question emerged regarding the Western Balkans, especially the region with a Muslim majority: the establishment of a "reserve Turkey" under the name and guise of an Albanian State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This was envisioned as a significant, large Turkish-Albanian, Muslim-Albanian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, expected to be dynamically successful and warlike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

This "Great Albania" would encompass parts of modern Albania, all of Kosovo, half of North Macedonia, and northern Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The possibility of such a powerful state became very serious in 1912, as Albanians began to unite, rebelling from 1910 onwards to establish a strong Albania separate from the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This prospect was the "real straw" that triggered the Balkan War in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Serbia and Greece formed an alliance, attacking from four sides, effectively reducing Albania to a "very small area" with European support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. The underlying reason for the Balkan War was to prevent the rise of a powerful Albanian Muslim state and to control the growth of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Ultimately, both Albania and Bulgaria were reduced in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

Albania was a kingdom for a period, with Ahmet Zogolli (also known as Ahmet Zahoğlu) as its king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Zogolli, from a feudal lord family in Northern Albania and an extension of the Esatpaşa Toptani dynasty (which founded Tirana), studied at Galatasaray High School in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. After Albania declared independence in 1912, he entered politics, became Prime Minister, and then declared himself King Zog I, ruling until 1939-1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. He was fluent in Istanbul Turkish due to his education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

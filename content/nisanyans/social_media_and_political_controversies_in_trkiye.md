From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker recently became a trending topic in [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Trkiye]], registered as one of the "most talked about enemies of the homeland and nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This incident stemmed from sentences spoken three years or more ago being taken out of context and disseminated on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Public reaction was swift and indignant, particularly questioning how one could "say something to the Adhan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Adhan Controversy

The speaker clarified their stance, stating that in principle, no one would object to the Adhan (call to prayer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. They see no point in a "sane person thinking negatively about such a subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even without religious attachment, the Adhan is viewed as a custom and tradition of people living in the same place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The core of the controversy lies in the *amplified* Adhan. The speaker objects when it is "yelled in your face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, perceiving the call to prayer recited with amplification as a "political attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Despite suggestions to complain to the municipality if decibel levels are exceeded, the speaker notes that officials often "do not lower it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This is attributed to a belief among those who recite the amplified call to prayer that they are "doing something important" and "challenging the society," which is seen as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

> "Grabbing someone by the collar and yelling at their face on the street is considered a hostile act anywhere in the world within the framework of normal human behavior. It is an attack on personal honor." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

The speaker believes that "adhan merchants who invade the streets and skies of TÃ¼rkiye with Opar" (amplification) suffer from this aggression and rudeness, which "should be combated" and "banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The amplified Adhan is not considered an act of worship or a requirement of faith, but rather a "tradition" that became common after the 1980s, originating perhaps in the 1950s or 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is characterized as "an expression of a shantytown belief related to the New Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The speaker notes that the video causing the recent stir was three years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They also expressed frustration with the media consistently using an "unsympathetic photo" from 2009 whenever negative articles are written about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Media Tactics and Ad Hominem Arguments

The use of out-of-context statements and unflattering images highlights common tactics in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Trkiye]]'s public discourse. The speaker discusses the frequent use of *ad hominem* arguments, where someone's character or past is attacked instead of addressing the validity of their thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

The speaker distinguishes between valid and invalid *ad hominem* arguments:
*   **Invalid ad hominem:** Attacking a person's character (e.g., "raped little girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>) to discredit their thesis without addressing the facts. This is seen as an "immoral approach" that distracts from the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **Valid ad hominem:** Presenting evidence that the person has a strong interest in their claim's truth or falsity (e.g., buying shares in a vaccine company before its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>). This type of argument holds "logical evidence" and is considered valid in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Cultural and Political Dynamics in Trkiye

The broader [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | social and cultural dynamics in Trkiye]] were also touched upon. The speaker reflected on the motto "How happy is the one who says I am a Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. While it might have been intended to restore the reputation of Anatolian people exploited by the Palace administration, it is seen as disrespectful to other peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire was a multinational society with various religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. The Republic, however, claimed to be the state of only one society, offering others two options: "either you [__] off and leave" or "you will deny your identity and join the one and only Turkish nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This approach became problematic as groups like the Kurds asserted their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.

### Ottoman Society and Religious Practice
In the Ottoman Empire, society was largely organized around religions, and religious duties provided daily life discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. There was a police force for Muslims that punished or warned those who did not pray or fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. However, the ruling class in large mansions could bypass religious obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>, while ordinary community members were under public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

Notably, a significant population, including Bektashis and Alevis, did not comply with the formal rules of Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. Their loyalty was strong to their own customs and religious leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. In the past, religious practice was a "natural life rhythm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>, with little objection.

### Modern [[impact_of_religion_and_politics_on_historical_and_current_events_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Religious-Political Conflict]]
In modern Trkiye, the cultural conflict has intensified, with "half of the society perceives religious rules and obligations as an imposition, as a compulsion, as tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a> and reacting against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The speaker contrasts this with the Greek island of Samos, where religion is not a political or social discussion topic; it is "like the air you breathe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>, integrated into daily life without coercion or objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

This perspective implies that the politicization of religion in Trkiye fuels much of the social and political tension seen in public discourse.

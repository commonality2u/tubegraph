April 24 is commemorated globally, especially in [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]], as the day of [[commemoration_of_the_armenian_genocide | commemoration]] of the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This event is deeply emotional and significant for the country, with populations often walking to monuments on this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Events of April 24, 1915

The date April 24 itself is not directly related to the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]]'s execution but marks a political step immediately preceding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major cities, 235 to 250 prominent figures of the Armenian community within the Ottoman Empire were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These individuals included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters – all known and impactful intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

A few days later, a group of those arrested were sent to two locations in Anatolia: Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While some managed to escape, many were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This operation, described as a "political collapse operation," aimed to remove the society's political leaders and those who could voice dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It indiscriminately targeted individuals, including those strongly against extremist nationalist Armenian movements or those with no organizational ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Similar operations also occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Progression to Massacres and Deportations

Following these arrests, starting in May 1915, the deportation of Armenian civilians, including women and children, began across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This gradually escalated into a process of mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

> "To say there was no [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is a complete waste of time. It is ignorance, that is, they do not know about history. Friend, that is, something like saying, eee Sultan Abdulhamid conquered Istanbul. There is nothing more correct than saying, go and see, my child. They know more or less. And then, [[political_and_social_implications_of_the_armenian_genocide | genocide denial]] is immoral. In other words, denying the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is either ignorance or immorality." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>

The speaker firmly asserts that the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] is an undeniable fact known worldwide, except for the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The Turkish state, for various reasons, systematically designed a [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] project beginning around 1895 and prepared its infrastructure from 1913 in a conscious and systematic manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This project was implemented in 1915, with the goal of eliminating the Armenian population and the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Ideological Roots and Union and Progress Party's Role

The policy of eliminating non-Muslim populations was advocated since the 1890s during the time of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. When the Union and Progress Party came to power in 1908 by overthrowing Abdulhamid, they initially adopted an optimistic approach, believing they could overcome these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. However, within a year or two (1909-1910), they progressively returned to the Abdulhamid project and mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

This shift became evident after the Adana events of 1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. By 1910 or 1911, the consensus was reached that a "new Turkey" could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. Although the Union and Progress government was shaken by the Balkan War in 1912, leading to a period of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, by 1913, with the Union and Progress cadres back in power, all plans for 1915 were ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. The project of cleansing Anatolia of its non-Muslim population was pursued consciously and resolutely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## The Lack of Alternative for Armenians

Unlike the Greek population, where a mutual population exchange and land for settlement existed (e.g., Greeks from Turkey settled in Macedonia and Western Thrace vacated by Turks and Bulgarians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, the Armenians had nowhere to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Deporting them to areas where they could pose a threat to the Ottoman Empire, which was fighting Russia in World War I, was seen as providing material to the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

Initially, a "bright idea" emerged to deport Armenians to Syria, assuming Russia would leave the war, and Syria would be abandoned afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. However, this situation "got completely out of hand," and it was realized that this was not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. The only perceived solution, therefore, became "cleansing" or "massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. This was also driven by the understanding that after the war, regardless of the outcome, the survivors would demand compensation, their lands, houses, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. To prevent these future claims, drastic measures were taken, resulting in the killing of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

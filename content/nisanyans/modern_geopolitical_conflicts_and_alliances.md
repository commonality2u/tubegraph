Recent global events highlight significant shifts in [[current_geopolitical_tensions_and_economic_strategies | geopolitical tensions]] and military capabilities. These developments suggest a challenging future for existing alliances and global power dynamics.

## Ukraine Conflict and NATO's Position

The [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] has revealed perceived weaknesses in Western military technology and strategic positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Allegations of NATO defeat
> One perspective suggests that NATO has been "defeated very badly in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. This view contends that a private company, Vagner PMC, fighting with Russian army support, managed to defeat forces aligned with 31 NATO countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

### Military Developments

Two significant military developments from the past week are cited:
1.  **Patriot Missile System Failure**: The highly praised U.S. Patriot missile system was allegedly "knocked out" by newly developed Russian missiles, hitting it "like a sitting chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This system was considered a "fundamental basis of America's claim of military superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>, purported to destroy any aircraft or missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This event reportedly validated Turkey's decision to purchase S-400s from Russia, as American military goods "turned out to be rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
2.  **Bakhmut Conflict**: The 8-month struggle in Bakhmut (Mahmut) is described as a "terrific conflict" executed with "incredible skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. Vagner PMC, a private company, fought with a small staff, completely destroying two Ukrainian corps and trapping them skillfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Over 100,000 Ukrainian fighters and mercenaries were allegedly destroyed in waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

The situation in Ukraine is compared to a beam under increasing load, now emitting "crackling sounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>, with the expectation that Ukraine will "collapse suddenly and completely on all fronts in a short time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>. The extended absence of Ukraine's president abroad during this critical period is noted as suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

### Inevitable War and Economic Justification

The current situation is seen as pushing NATO towards an "open war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a> for several reasons:
*   **Credibility Crisis**: The perceived "great defeat in Ukraine" is considered a disaster for NATO and the European Union, threatening their credibility and potentially leading to their collapse "like paper Shah Atalar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.
*   **Financial Collapse**: The Western financial world, including banks and state treasuries, faces a "very big crisis" and is "at the point of bankruptcy" due to uncontrollable borrowing over the last 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. For example, the United States' total debt is cited as 31 trillion dollars or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>, which is deemed "unsustainable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. A large war could serve as an excuse to inform these debts and write them off, with the promise to "pay your debt with the treasures we will loot from Russia and China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

### NATO's Strategic Challenges

Despite the perceived necessity for war, a "terrible truth" is that NATO currently has "no possibility of winning a war" due to its "current situation of NATO's front lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   **Overextension**: NATO's expansion and filling of a "power vacuum" in the 1990s led to overextension, placing them "too far from their main bases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. Logistics for areas like the Baltic countries, Poland, Moldova, Romania, and Iran are described as a "nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.
*   **Logistical Disadvantage**: In contrast, Russia and China's homelands are "very short distances from their production bases and population centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>, allowing them to easily send troops to the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.

This implies that the "Western world as we know it" may be coming to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>, and while they may not withdraw without a fight, current data suggests the West has "no chance in this war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.

## Global Power Shifts and Modernization

The concept of "democracy" in today's propaganda discourse is viewed cynically, suggesting it's often applied to places the West "likes or considers allies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. For example, Turkey is called an "illiberal democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a> while regimes with strong popular support like Hungary, China, or Russia are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### The Arab World's New Modernity

A "great revolution" is underway in the Arab world, specifically highlighting Saudi Arabia's radical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Ambitious Projects**: Projects like "the new Kaaba" (a massive cube-shaped building as big as a city) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a> and "The Line" (a giant desert city) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a> are presented as examples of their claim to be "pioneers of modernity in this age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Realignment**: They have "radically cut off relations with England and America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>, reached agreements with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>, and accepted Syria back into their midst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. They have also declared they will not sell in dollars to Russia and other markets, largely trading with Chinese money, and will not participate in sanctions against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

This represents a claim to be the "leading power of the new age in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>, aiming to determine "the next step, the next stage, the next horizon, the borders of humanity" without abandoning Islamic tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>. This is seen as a "brave move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

## Historical Context of Modernization and Geopolitical Dynamics

A comparison is drawn between Russia's and the Ottoman Empire's modernization efforts.
*   **Russia's Success**: Russia, despite being ethnically diverse, saw its political sovereignty and modernization efforts led by ethnic Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. Artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen emerged from the Russian identity, leading to a significant leap forward in reforms and becoming a main power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Empire's Challenges**: In contrast, the Ottoman Empire experienced a growing conflict where the leadership of change and modernization was largely taken by Christian elements (Greeks, Armenians, Christian Arabs, Serbs, Bulgarians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. These groups, while modernizing, were distrusted by the state's dominant political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>. This led to deepening gaps and "mutual massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>, resulting in the modernizing groups also being perceived as "enemies of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>. This internal conflict prevented similar modernization progress to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

### Crimean Tatar Settlements and Population Shifts

The historical spread of Tatar populations along the northern Black Sea coast, including parts of modern Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. Russia gradually absorbed these territories and cleared the population, leading to Tatar migrations to Dobruja (northern Bulgaria/eastern Romania) and then to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. Crimea remained a region of Tatar political sovereignty for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>, though their population there significantly diminished in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.

These historical and contemporary [[geopolitical_dynamics_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical dynamics]] and [[middle_eastern_geopolitics_and_alliances | alliances]] illustrate the complex interplay of military strength, economic pressures, and cultural shifts shaping the global landscape.

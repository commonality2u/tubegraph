From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is framed not as a war between Russia and Ukraine, but as a war between Russia and the [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | Western alliance]], primarily led by NATO and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This perspective highlights a critical view of [[challenges_and_criticisms_of_western_science_and_propaganda | Western public opinion]], particularly in Türkiye, which is often seen as repeating [[challenges_and_criticisms_of_western_science_and_propaganda | propaganda headlines]] with fierce determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Western Actions and Narratives

### The Nature of Western Propaganda
Western propaganda is described as a series of simple theses, such as "Putin must have gone crazy," "how can he invade an independent country," and "the bombing is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This narrative is criticized for lacking objective analysis, with the speaker questioning the inviolability of state borders, particularly when considering the actions of a military alliance like NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The speaker expresses surprise at how easily people accept the discourse of an alliance perceived as the "pioneer and leader and the main actor of all kinds of meanness and dishonesty in the world" since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that the West, particularly the Americans, are masters of [[challenges_and_criticisms_of_western_science_and_propaganda | propaganda]], employing high-quality scriptwriters to craft narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. An example cited is the false story of Ukrainian soldiers on an island telling Russian forces to "go to hell," which was instantly swallowed by millions as heroism but was a complete fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Era and NATO Expansion
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991, which occurred almost completely peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, Russia had a "big dream" of being accepted and embraced by the West, to be shown the way to establish democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Russia saw itself as a natural part of European civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. During this period, Russia even requested to join NATO, believing that if the Warsaw Pact was liquidated, NATO would also disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

However, the reality differed significantly. The [[comparative_views_on_russia_and_western_europe | Western world]], especially Americans, Germans, and others, "swooped down on Russia with an army of looters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, exploiting Russia's natural resources, industrial facilities, art collections, and even women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. This period exposed Russian society to "the ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

Towards 1998, Russian society, through a natural reflex, began efforts to prevent this looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This resistance, often through violent methods by what the West labeled "Russian oligarchs" or "mafias," was met with a violent reaction in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

### Policies of Containment and Destabilization
The speaker claims American rulers tried to keep Russia "hungry" and even break it up, similar to the Soviet Union's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. The spark point for this was Chechnya, where foreign-trained Islamic militants, pushed from Türkiye, were sent to start a guerrilla war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. The election of Putin in 2002 saw him tasked with suppressing this, which he achieved by destroying Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. The [[western_countries_and_their_approach_to_the_ukraine_conflict | Western world]] "never forgave Putin" for this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. Similar attempts to instigate Islamic guerrilla movements failed in Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

Georgia, a problematic country, was also used to try and integrate Chechnya into NATO through Turkey, encouraging fanatic Georgian nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. When Georgia started a policy of massacre and expulsion against its own minorities, Russia attacked Georgia, resulting in a swift defeat for Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

Since the mid-1990s, during the Clinton period, a bureaucratic movement gained influence in Washington, notably figures like Paul Wolfowitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. This group "insistently defended the idea that Russia was an enemy" and that NATO's policies should be shaped accordingly, eventually dominating American foreign policy with "crazy self-confidence" from 2000 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. These individuals are described as "sick of power" and driven by prejudice and arrogance, having abandoned objective thought about Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

### NATO's Transformation and Aggression
NATO, originally established in 1949 to combat and limit the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>, had no logical reason to exist after the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. However, as a "huge organization" and "giant interest organization" that feeds a tremendous staff and the arms industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>, its sole purpose became maintaining its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>. This led to a redefinition of NATO's enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

NATO began expanding its area starting from 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. While the unification of Germany was allowed based on an agreement with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>, subsequent expansions included Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. The inclusion of the three Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) into NATO was seen as particularly provocative, as these countries were strategically positioned against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Further expansion brought in Bulgaria and Romania, followed by the division of Yugoslavia and the absorption of its parts into NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

Since 2008, the inclusion of Ukraine into NATO became a key agenda item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. When the Ukrainian administration resisted, a coup in 2014 changed the administration, bringing Ukraine under Western influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This led to a bloody conflict in 2014, with demands from Russian-speaking populations suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. Tens of thousands were killed in regions like Donetsk and Lugansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. Despite Russia's clear warnings since the early 2000s that Ukraine could not be included in NATO due to its historical and economic ties to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>, the [[western_countries_and_their_approach_to_the_ukraine_conflict | West continually affirmed Ukraine's future NATO membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.

### Underestimation of the Enemy
[[geopolitical_dynamics_and_potential_alliances_in_europe | Western policy]] is frequently based on underestimating the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>. Historical examples of those who tried to "easily defeat Russia" (Napoleon in 1812, the Ottoman Empire in 1877, and Hitler in 1941) all ended in "great disappointment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. The current conflict is seen as a "gamble, a loss shot" by those with historical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.

### Western Interventions and Destruction
The speaker criticizes Western powers for "bombing an independent country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>, citing examples such as the bombing of Serbia in 1998 to create an independent Kosovo run by drug trafficking gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>, the destruction of Iraq in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>, and invasions and destruction in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>. These actions are described as a "strangulation operation" by a "gang of gangsters" or "bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>.

### Western Bureaucracy and "Socratic Dictatorship"
The West is described as having an "extremely organized and extremely captive... socratic dictatorship that penetrates every area of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. People's daily lives are dominated by complying with "meaningless and purposeless rules of a package of bureaucratic cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>, with a high probability of punishment for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. The speaker argues that this "police state and dictatorship" has reached a frightening level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. Governments in the West are seen as merely "pretending to govern" and striking poses, with real political power increasingly held by bureaucracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. This trend of strengthening bureaucracies worldwide is seen as turning into a "mechanical monster that suffocates societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>.

## Implications for International Relations

### Turkey's Geopolitical Strategy
The [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | policy Türkiye has implemented in recent years regarding NATO and Russia]] is viewed as a "successful," "correct," and "rational" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. This policy, described as similar to İsmet İnönü's approach during World War II, involves presenting a friendly face to both sides, taking pictures with Western leaders, and making supportive statements, while also fulfilling some demands of the other side and diversifying weapon procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. This "slippery" approach is considered the best policy for a country without the sole power to cope with neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.

### The Montreux Agreement
The Montreux Agreement is considered significant in the context of the Ukraine war, with Russia being its biggest defender and most positively affected party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:38">[01:59:38]</a>. The agreement places serious restrictions on the entry of warships from non-Black Sea countries into the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:04">[02:00:04]</a>. If the war escalates and [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO countries]] are forced to intervene directly, Türkiye would be under "very heavy pressure" to join the war, potentially facing the NATO agreement being used as a weapon against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. This situation presents a bargaining opportunity for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:19">[02:04:19]</a>.

### Fundamental Contradiction of the West and Russia
The fundamental contradiction between the West and Russia is identified as capitalism's desire to freely commodify and exploit the resources, industrial products, and human capital of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>. Russia, alongside China, represents one of the only two geographies where [[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | Western capitalism]] and companies cannot freely operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a>. The resistance from these powers, who demand their share in the state, is seen as the core reason for the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:14">[01:50:14]</a>. The speaker suggests that if India were to join this alliance, the West's position would become significantly more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:19">[01:50:19]</a>.

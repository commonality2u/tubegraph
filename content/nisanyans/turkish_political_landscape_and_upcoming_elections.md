## Overview of the Political Climate
The speaker notes that the administration panel for Zoom has changed, causing difficulty in understanding what was going on, leading to a four-minute delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An initial link sent to program participants might not work, requiring a new link to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

On the current [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | Turkish political landscape]], the speaker references the President's recent complaint about those who make judgments "with a glass of whiskey in their hand," which the speaker found personally satisfying as it suggested the President watches their programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Electoral Stance and Concerns
The speaker reveals their vote, which was publicly shared on Twitter: one vote for [[Kemal Kilicdaroglu]] and one for the Green Left Party, which is the adopted name of the dear [[HDP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Regarding [[Kemal Kilicdaroglu]], the speaker has repeatedly stated two main concerns:
1.  He could win the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  The speaker does not believe he can successfully govern if he wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The speaker's mind on these issues has not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Critique of the Current Government
The speaker believes that the head of the current government and their "right-hand assistant" have "really screwed things up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It is asserted that it is time for this 20-year-long government to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. While a month ago the speaker was "50-50," statements made after the earthquake and the government's recent attitude solidified their view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

> "I think Tayyip Erdogan has done some really revolutionary work for Turkey in the first ten years of his rule. A certain relaxation, a certain transformation in the frozen and hardened structure of Türkiye. It opened the door to the possibility, but the point the country has reached in recent years, especially after the transition to the presidential system, is not a tolerable point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

The President's moral and intellectual weaknesses are seen as having "really got out of hand" due to long-term rule, reaching an "uncontrollable point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The state that Bahçeli has reached is described as "disgrace," with "no other explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The speaker questions how much longer [[Turkish political landscape and election analysis | Turkey]] can tolerate such "nonsense" and "perpetual ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Hopes and Doubts for the Future
The speaker hopes for a "calm and successful election" next week, with a result that will "satisfy everyone," including supporters of the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. However, hopes for this are "not very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It is believed that [[Tayyip Erdoğan]] will leave power in the "not-so-distant future," though whether this will be through elections or other methods, or if [[Kemal Kilicdaroglu]] or someone else will replace him, are separate issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The speaker firmly states that [[Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s "expiration date has expired for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Reasons for Doubts about the Opposition
The speaker openly shares doubts and speculations about the upcoming [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | elections]].

*   **Historical Bloc**: The traditional historical bloc represented by [[Kemal Kilicdaroglu]]'s party is not considered a "better bloc than the Islamist bloc" in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Having followed [[Turkish politics and elections | politics]] since the 1960s, the speaker recalls that [[election_results_and_political_analysis_in_trkiye | Turkey]] was "not a good place" before [[Tayyip Erdoğan]], and has generally not been a good place since 1920, except for short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A political movement that does not openly confront this past is deemed unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Coalition Difficulties**: A party that relies on both the [[HDP]] and a party like the İyi Party (representing [[Turkish political developments and changes in government | Türkiye]]'s fascist tradition) to govern is unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Continuity**: In an era of rapid global transformation, the speaker finds the political line adopted by [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Türkiye]] in recent years to be "right," but doubts how long a new government would want to continue this line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite these reservations, the speaker will vote for [[Kemal Kilicdaroglu]] and encourage relatives to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The speaker does not believe the current government will leave power "unless they are forced to do so or are under very strong pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. An anecdote from 1969/70 describes how Necmettin Erbakan was "dragged out by the neck" after losing an election, and the current President was "that subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Public Passivity
A listener's question about public passivity in [[political_changes_in_Turkey | Turkey]] and why people are not protesting on the streets as they do in other countries is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. The speaker states that people are taking to the streets in countries like Pakistan, African countries, and Latin American countries, but "there is no such thing in the western world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. Even in France, where the "whole country has revolted," the police have the power to suppress such movements, rendering them unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

Furthermore, in these countries, including [[Turkey]], France, Germany, England, and the USA, there is no "alternative that will excite people and even lead to death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. The political party struggle has devolved into a "Karagöz Hacivat thing," a "ridiculous stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. There is no transformative leader like Robin Pier or Lenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. People do not start a revolution "for no reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. Social media acts as a "toy," where people spend time with "virtual fights," "shouting virtual slogans," and "playing team matches that have no results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This is because these actions have no "equivalent in the political field," meaning there is no power to translate them into results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. The speaker believes the situation "won't continue like this" but also does not think it will change in the "near future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

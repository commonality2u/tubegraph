The notion that a 1400-year-old Quran copy is 99.5% similar to modern versions is regarded as a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is stated that there is no serious data to support the idea that the Quran was extensively written down before 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This earlier period is instead associated with fallacies and half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Arabic Script Development

A crucial aspect of the Quran's compilation is the [[history_of_quran_codification | codification of the Arabic script]] itself.
The Arabic script was first codified around 680 AD, during the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This codification was specifically undertaken for the purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Before this period, during the time of Muhammad and the 60 years following his death, Arabic writing consisted mainly of graffiti or short worship scribbles (3-5 words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The script lacked essential features like dots and vowel movements, making it a distorted version useful only for basic notes, not for literary works or official correspondence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. At that time, the primary written language of the Middle East was Syriac, which functioned as a high-level, cultured language akin to Latin and was used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The very concept of writing Arabic, then considered a tribal language, had not yet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Fabricated Compilation Narratives

Claims that a commission was established during Muhammad's time or the period of Hz. Osman to write down the Quran are considered fabrications that emerged approximately 180 years after the events, during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This fabrication is understood as a psychological response to the discomfort people felt regarding the fact that the Quran was not written during Muhammad's lifetime or soon after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The narrative of the Quran being written in Osman's time originated from this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Umayyad Compilation and Political Influence

Objective, scientific information indicates that the Quran was compiled around 680 AD during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Until this point, the content existed as small messages, drawing from [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Syriac]] and [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Jewish]] traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These messages were primarily transmitted orally, with people memorizing and reciting them in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

However, questions regarding the authenticity of this oral transmission arose during the writing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. At the time of writing, different traditions and variations of verses existed across various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These differing accounts were eventually suppressed by the order of Hajjaj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A single text was then created, aligned with the political interests of the unified Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This compilation occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Translation of Sukiyasi's Geography Dictionary (1902)

The speaker is translating a geography dictionary published by Sukiyasi in 1902, which he discovered in 2009-2010 while working on place names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The dictionary focuses on "Eastern Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:05">[03:53:05]</a>, presenting information from an Armenian perspective, highlighting Armenians within the framework of Armenian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

The book is considered extraordinarily useful due to several factors:
*   **Microhistory** It provides detailed information about the micro-history of the region, including every village, town, fountain, hill, and ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Approximately seventy percent of the information found in this dictionary is not available in Turkish sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Armenian Crisis** It serves as an extraordinary source for anyone interested in [[political_history_of_turkey | Ottoman history]] or the Armenian crisis, which was a significant crisis in the latter period of [[political_history_of_turkey | Ottoman history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. It helps understand the actions and motivations of various parties without reducing them to "stupid clichés" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Context for 1915** The book, written 15 years before the 1915 incident, reveals that the "final Tekir and massacre" (referring to the events of 1915) was merely a "footnote" or the "final act" of a long and painful process that had been ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. The speaker criticizes the tendency to view Armenian [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | history]] as solely beginning and ending in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Narrative and Cultural Insights** The author, a priest, weaves in fun stories and tales about villages and details, drawing from a rich collection of old Armenian [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | history]] sources, including vekaynames (chronicles), presenting events from the 4th to the 19th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. It demonstrates how physical geography can be described as completely different through another culture and narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

The speaker is adding extensive comments and explanations to the translation for the Turkish reader, clarifying references to ceremonies, customs, and names that would otherwise be incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. He is also completing some missing parts by using the author's original sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Additionally, he provides information on the current status and changing names of places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Some sections not directly related to present-day Turkey (such as those about Armenia, Iran, and Russia) have been cut, reducing the original 1300-page book to 800 pages, which will expand back to 1200-1300 pages with the speaker's additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. The translation is estimated to be 80% complete and will finish in about a month, with additions and forewords continuing until early summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

## Palu: A Case Study of Demographic Change

Palu, an ancient city near Elazığ, has a deep-rooted [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | history]] dating back to prehistoric times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. In the early 19th century, Armenians constituted a significant part of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. Around 1828-1830, a Dervish Lodge was established by Şeyhi Muhterem, a relative of the famous Şeyh Said, leader of the 1924 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, drawing a large number of Zazas from Bingöl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. This influx led to increased insecurity, attacks, rapes, and harassment in Palu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Consequently, the Armenian population, which had been present for a long time, gradually migrated to cities like Elazığ, Harput, Adana, Kayseri, and Diyarbakır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. By the end of the 19th century, very few Armenians remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. In rural areas, many Armenians opted for religious conversion to become "invisible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. The Zaza population, not native to the region, eventually dominated Palu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

## Current [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Political Situation in Trkiye]]

A common sentiment among many is the desire for [[political_situation_in_trkiye | President Erdoğan]] to leave office, driven by his pervasive hate speech and "ugly language" that has "ruined this society" and fostered a "hate hysteria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.

However, the speaker, drawing on [[political_history_of_turkey | Türkiye's past]], warns against the naive expectation that a change in leadership will automatically lead to a better outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. He references historical parallels:
*   **Fall of Abdulhamid** Those who hailed his successors as saviors faced disappointment within 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>.
*   **Adnan Menderes Era** Those who rebelled against Adnan Menderes' dictatorial rule and supported the May 27 coup also faced negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.
*   **March 12 Military Coup** The bloody and disgraceful dictatorship established by those who came to power with promises of progressivism, democracy, and modernity after the March 12 military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>.

The speaker argues that the most dangerous political trend in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is the "most tyrannical trend" of Kemalism and Turkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>. He predicts that their ascent to power would lead to a "bloodier, more brutal, and worse dictatorship than today in a very short time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. This group, described as "urban nationalist Kemalist, civilized and stylish bourgeois," and even supportive of contemporary social issues, exhibits a "level of bigotry" and disregard for moral restraints that is "more severe than religious fanatics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>.

He anticipates a period of "shaking" and "staggering" for 2-4 years if [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Erdoğan]] is replaced by [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Kılıçdaroğlu]], with no clear idea of the eventual outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. The plans and projects presented by the opposition are seen as unconvincing and unrealistic, mere "empty talks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. A government dominated by Ataturkists and folk singers, even with Kemal Kilicdaroglu at the helm, is believed to bring no good to [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], potentially making the current [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] seem preferable in retrospect due to an even greater level of bigotry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.

## Moral Principles and Societal Behavior

The speaker discusses the concept of "group solidarity" as a fundamental moral principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. He argues that loyalty to one's group (family, tribe, village, nation, political party, football team, professional group) is a primary moral obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Dismissing these loyalties in favor of an abstract "humanity" is deemed "filthy" and "immoral," as in the real world, morality is often defined by "us and them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. He suggests that the corruption or immorality of "our own" is often perceived as a lighter offense than that of "outsiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

He critiques the Enlightenment period's cosmopolitanism, exemplified by thinkers like Voltaire, who advocated for universal treatment of all people regardless of race, gender, or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. The speaker argues that these intellectuals, while believing they transcended tribal loyalties, were themselves a "tribe" – an elite group that shared a common language (French), lifestyle, and rational approach, and considered their own ways to be universally human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. He asserts that the underlying tribal logic of loyalty to one's own group persists, even if implicitly, for both an "enlightened" Kant and a "wretched Arab tribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

## [[Geopolitical developments involving Trkiye | Geopolitical Developments Involving Trkiye]]

### Saudi Arabia-Iran Rapprochement

The China-initiated rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran is described as a "historical event" that will "completely change the balance in the Middle East and radically change it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. This development marks the end of the isolation policy towards Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a> and signifies the union of the Middle East's greatest financial power (Saudi Arabia) with its greatest military and population power (Iran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. The speaker expresses surprise at the lack of attention given to this significant event in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], noting that people in the country often do not follow or understand international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. He predicts that the outcomes of this rapprochement will be serious, signaling the end of a 30-40 year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia's Transformation

The speaker notes that many in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] hold negative stereotypes about Islamic countries, expecting them to be dirty and judgmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. However, he states that those who visit Qatar or the United Arab Emirates are often shocked by their prosperity, modernity, and progressive services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. While acknowledging these are city-states and exceptions, he points out that Saudi Arabia is aware of its neighbors' development and has ten times their combined wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. Contrary to popular belief, Saudi leaders are not "stupid people" but are capable of seeing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

In the last 5-6 years, Saudi Arabia has embarked on a radical transformation to become a global center for modern architecture, ambitious engineering, production, culture, and art, willing to invest heavily in this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>. Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, in particular, is believed to have concluded that America is not a good investment for the future, leading him to seek new investment areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | Cultural and Historical Narratives in Trkiye]]

### The "Alevism from Luvians" Claim

The speaker dismisses the idea that Alevis originated from the ancient Anatolian people, the Luwians, as "absurd" and a product of "ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:02">[02:22:02]</a>. He states that Alevi historically means a "supporter of Ali" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, similar to how a supporter of Moses is a Jew or Jesus is an Ishevi (Christian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>.

He explains that the term "Alevi" as a distinct sectarian identity for a specific group in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is a relatively recent development:
*   Historically, groups now called Alevis in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] were known as Kızılbaş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>.
*   The word "Alevi" gained prominence in Syria when the French administration, after taking over in 1918, created autonomous regions based on ethnic and sectarian grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a>. They established an "Ali Alevi region" in Latakia (including Antakya), and although it was later liquidated, the term "Alevi" persisted as a more polite alternative to "Nusayri," which Syrian Alevis disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:14">[02:24:14]</a>.
*   In [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], the word "Alevi" in a political sense was first widely heard in January 1937, having been previously unknown in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:44">[02:24:44]</a>.

Regarding the Luwian connection, the speaker clarifies that "Luwian language" was a term used by the Hittites to describe a language spoken in a large part of southern Anatolia (from Konya to Izmir, the Mediterranean Region) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>. This term was not heard again for 3000 years after the Hittite Royal Archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>. It was rediscovered and became an academic term in the late 19th/early 20th century with the deciphering of Hittite archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:38">[02:26:38]</a>. Therefore, associating this obscure ancient language with modern Alevism is deemed an "ideological pathology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:33">[02:27:33]</a>.

## Mathematics Village in Şirince

The Mathematics Village in Şirince is differentiated from an ordinary theme park by its fundamental purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Unlike theme parks established to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>, the Mathematics Village was founded based on "several idealized goals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>:
*   A passionate mathematician's desire to share [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | his knowledge]] with young people and educate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   The desire to create a beautiful place with intelligence and agility in every detail, at minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
*   A shared concern that the university institution was becoming "blocked and exhausted," losing its purpose and becoming a bureaucratic state-controlled entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. This led to a passion for establishing an alternative educational institution that could serve as a model for reform in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

The initial motivations were a love for mathematics, the beauty of the location, and a concern for educational reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. However, the speaker acknowledges that financial concerns inevitably arise when running such a place, leading to compromises and the need to conform to societal averages to avoid bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. This process of institutionalization often leads to the original idea fading, horizons narrowing, and moral sensitivity decreasing, a "bitter end that every prophet experienced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

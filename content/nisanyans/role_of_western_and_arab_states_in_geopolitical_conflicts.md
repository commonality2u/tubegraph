Both Western and Arab states play significant and often contrasting roles in [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | global political dynamics and conflicts]], particularly in the [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions]]. Their approaches to conflicts like those in Palestine and Ukraine reveal complex motivations, historical alignments, and evolving public and state interests.

## Western States' Involvement

Western countries' involvement in [[tensions_and_conflicts_in_the_middle_east | Middle East conflicts]] and other global issues is characterized by strong alliances, economic interests, and sometimes conflicting internal public opinions.

### Support for Israel in the Gaza Conflict
Western nations, especially the United States, have historically maintained strong support for Israel. The speaker notes that "western countries that currently support and encourage the state of Israel by 10000%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This unwavering support is a continuation of a policy present "since 1945 or 1917" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, raising questions about whether this stance is taken willingly or "under some obligations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Despite state policies, "the public opinion of the western countries have taken a stance against the policy that their own states have very clearly stated at an unprecedented rate in recent history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. In response to widespread pro-Palestine sentiment, some Western nations like England, France, and Germany have "banned demonstrations in favor of Palestine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> and threatened arrests and deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Social media, however, has overwhelmingly favored Palestine globally, with pro-Palestinian messages on TikTok reportedly being 15 times more prevalent than pro-Israeli messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Role of NATO
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a key Western alliance, has been notably quiet regarding the recent Israel-Palestine conflict. The speaker observes that "NATO has not made a sound other than the statements made in the first few days in this latest Israel and Palestine incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. While individual Western powers like America and England are deploying fleets and aircraft, "the team that is being prepared is not NATO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. This might be influenced by Turkey's position as a NATO member, as it has "clearly contradicted NATO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a> on this issue and possesses veto power over NATO decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

### Involvement in the Ukraine Conflict
Western countries, particularly the US and its allies, are deeply involved in the [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including_the_ukraine_and_gaza | Ukraine conflict]]. The speaker asserts that the "real War is the global hegemony war waged by America and its allies against the worldwide hegemony led by Russia and China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. The [[western_countries_and_their_approach_to_the_ukraine_conflict | Western countries and their approach to the Ukraine conflict]] is seen as a key front in this larger geopolitical struggle. The speaker predicts the Ukraine War is "quietly approaching its end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, with the Western alliance giving ultimatums to Ukraine's leadership, suggesting the war is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

The speaker also criticizes Western policy concerning the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), noting that the US has "encouraged these three small and weak countries" to "arm themselves to the teeth and take a hostile stance against Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, which is deemed "not tolerable" by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## Arab States' Involvement

Arab states' responses to geopolitical conflicts, particularly the Israel-Palestine issue, are often viewed as passive and influenced by external powers.

### Response to the Gaza Conflict
Regarding the recent events in Gaza, Arab states and Iran are described as having "responded to this incident with an extremely sloppy attitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. While there have been "some verbal condemnations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, in practice, "they do whatever America orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The speaker predicts that this situation "will change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> due to "mass pressure, public pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, rather than genuine concern for Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Despite widespread Arab and Muslim support for Palestine, which includes street protests and boycotts, the speaker notes that "the Arab and Muslim world does nothing except chant slogans on the streets and boycott Coca-Cola" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

### Countering Islamist Extremism
The speaker points to several non-Western states, including Arab nations, as examples of effectively combating Islamist extremism, contrasting their methods with Israel's.
*   **Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain:** These countries are noted for having "managed to create extremely modern, extremely developed, Eee Brave dynamic societies" while nominally preserving "all the principles and values ​​of Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
*   **China and Russia:** These countries are presented as having successfully countered Islamist fanaticism through education, economic development, and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, with Russia having "not a single serious Islamist movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a> among its diverse Muslim populations, and China demonstrating "extraordinary success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> in handling the Uyghur terrorism movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Context
The current conflicts are seen as part of a larger struggle for global hegemony. The speaker suggests that the "great revolution" of the 21st century "has started in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a> and "maybe it will continue in Palestine, Iran and similar places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. This revolution aims to break the "central control mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>, particularly American hegemony, and "any other attempt at global hegemony that could replace it must be broken, if necessary, through war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

The speaker expresses strong anti-American sentiment, believing Americans are "the biggest trouble in the world right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a> and trusts Russia as "the only power that is currently carrying out or can carry out this fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a> against this perceived global hegemony. This perspective highlights the evolving [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | impact of Great Power dynamics on Middle East conflicts]] and other regional issues, influencing the [[geopolitical_shifts_in_the_21st_century_postsyria_conflict | geopolitical shifts in the 21st century post-Syria conflict]] and beyond.

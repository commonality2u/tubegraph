The Covid incident is identified as one of three major crises that have shaken the world in the last five years, appearing suddenly around January 29 or 30, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The first case in the Western world was reportedly detected in Canada, where the speaker was present at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

## Initial Skepticism and Reasons

From the outset, specifically from the day Covid became a headline, the speaker strongly believed it was a "big fraud" and consistently expressed this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This conviction stemmed from several factors:
*   **Propaganda Detection** The speaker, having followed the Western press for 60 years, claims to immediately detect how [[Public perception and media influence on Turkeys political landscape | propaganda campaigns]] are set up, identifying a "conscious set up" in the Covid narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. News was perceived as centrally produced, lacking factual basis, and designed to create panic and impose a certain viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Systematic Pandemic Preparation** Observations over several years indicated a systematic "pandemic propaganda" and "pandemic preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. It seemed clear that this pandemic was "consciously organized" by the governing powers as a social project, with preparations beginning a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Unverifiable Expert Statements** The superficial statements made by so-called expert cadres were deemed impossible to verify through logic or empirical experiment, leading to the impression that "all of the information is lies without exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

## Bureaucratic Overreach and Lies

The speaker asserts that the Covid phenomenon appeared to be initially designed as a biological warfare rehearsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. It then transformed into an "orgy of bureaucracies that were extremely powerful and largely disconnected from reason," becoming a "Bureaucratic Enthusiasm ceremony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. A significant consequence was that people became accustomed to authority figures "speaking lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. This included doctors, who were claimed to have spoken "a lot of lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## The Vaccine Question

The introduction of the vaccine incident raised questions about its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. The speaker ponders whether it was a genuine scientific development hoped to bring a solution, or a "fraud scheme made directly to earn a few hundred billion dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. While acknowledging a possible real scientific study and an experiment based on assumptions that "turned out completely F," the speaker also emphasizes its use as a tool for a "terrifying fund transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. This led to individuals and institutions becoming wealthy "thanks to Covid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Proven Views

The speaker expresses satisfaction that the perspectives defended since 2020 regarding the Covid event have been "completely proven right from A to Z" and are now widely shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. This aligns with broader discussions on [[Conspiracy theories and public trust in information | conspiracy theories and public trust in information]] and [[Conspiracy theories and authority | conspiracy theories and authority]].

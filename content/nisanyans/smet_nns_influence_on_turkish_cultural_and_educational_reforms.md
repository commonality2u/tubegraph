İsmet İnönü, a prominent figure in Turkish history, exhibited a unique approach to cultural and educational matters, particularly distinct from that of his predecessor, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. His influence is noted in several key areas, reflecting a cautious yet significant impact on the nation's cultural and educational landscape.

## Personal Cultural Interests and Their Diffusion

İnönü's interest in Western culture and law was regarded as sincere, not merely for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Unlike Atatürk, whose musical taste was described as not extending much beyond Safiye Ayla with dance tunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, İnönü harbored a deep love for classical music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He acquired this passion in Yemen, a period during which he was deeply influenced by his commander, Ahmet İzzet Pasha, a cultured man who appreciated classical music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. İnönü actively worked to share this love with the people of Ankara, and it is largely attributed to him that a classical music tradition, albeit weak, exists in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This aspect reflects an influence on shaping cultural tastes and access to certain art forms.

## Educational Initiatives

During his time, İsmet İnönü strongly supported the establishment of [[challenges_in_turkish_education_system | Village Institutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He backed a "second generation" of cadres, including figures like Hasan Ali Yücel and İsmail Tonguç, who were instrumental in these educational reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, it is also noted that those who later acted to close the Institutes were also from his lineage of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This suggests a complex legacy where his support for progressive educational models was significant, but the institutions themselves faced later challenges.

## Management of the Cult of Personality and Ideology

İnönü kept his distance from [[impact_of_major_historical_figures_on_turkish_politics | Turkism movements]] that gained traction after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. His actions, such as breaking the pro-Nazi structure in Turkey with arrests in 1942, turned Turkists against him in a "blood feud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This shows his cautious stance against ideological extremism within the state.

A significant cultural-political shift attributed to İnönü was the removal of Atatürk's picture from money and other public places in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This was seen as a potential first step towards "erasing the traces of a 15-year period of power intoxication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While Atatürk had created a system where all authority was concentrated in one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>, İnönü, upon assuming the presidency, did not maintain such absolute sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. The culture of Atatürk was gradually "erased" from money and books during İnönü's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, and the monumental tomb (Anıtkabir) project for Atatürk was forgotten for 12 years, with Atatürk's body kept in a museum basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>. This demonstrated an effort to distance Turkey from the personality cults seen in places like the Soviet Union with Lenin and Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

However, this policy of de-emphasizing Atatürk's cult was reversed after 1950, during the Democrat Party era, when the "Atatürk protection law" was enacted, insulting his memory was prohibited, and the Anıtkabir project was revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This suggests that İnönü's influence on the long-term cultural landscape was not always continuous, and political shifts could alter policies regarding national symbols.

## Broader Context of [[modernization_efforts_in_turkish_history | Modernization Efforts in Turkish History]]

The broader cultural context of the Ottoman ruling elite, from which İnönü emerged, is also relevant. The 19th century Tanzimat period saw the rise of a new type of educated civil servant, trained in Western-style education (physics, mathematics, geography), who was sent to manage various regions, including Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. This process highlighted a gap between the Ottoman elite's desired identity and their actual reality, which was traumatic for them and perceived negatively by the Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. İnönü's own acquisition of classical music from Ahmet İzzet Pasha in Yemen exemplifies the [[cultural_and_educational_aspects_of_the_ottoman_ruling_class | cultural and educational aspects of the Ottoman ruling class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. While not a direct "reform," it showcases the cultural influences that shaped leaders like İnönü, who then in turn influenced Turkish culture.

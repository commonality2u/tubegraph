The adoption of surnames by Armenians in the [[Armenian_surnames_in_the_Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman Empire]] underwent a significant transformation, particularly in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Context of Surnames

Until the end of the 18th century, it was very rare for ordinary Armenians in the [[Armenian_surnames_in_the_Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman Empire]] to possess surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Surnames were primarily used by the aristocracy, elite, or notables from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Common individuals would be identified by their first name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This practice was similar to that of Turks during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

A widespread and rapid adoption of surnames by all Armenians began around the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. From that point, individuals became known by their surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Influence of Turkish Language on Armenian Surnames

A notable characteristic of these newly adopted surnames was their predominantly Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon is explained by several factors:

*   **Linguistic Dominance:** By 1828, the mother tongue of the vast majority of Armenians in the [[Armenian_surnames_in_the_Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman Empire]] was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Armenian Language Use:** In the 1820s, many Armenians either did not know Armenian at all, or it was a language primarily used in religious settings or specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The major educational campaign of the 19th century later played a role in the revival of Armenian as a cultural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Public Sphere:** Even if Armenian was spoken at home, Turkish was the common language for public conduct, particularly in the bazaar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. There were no bazaars within Ottoman borders where Armenian was spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. As surnames needed to be declared to neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks), using the prevalent public language was practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Origin of Armenian Surnames

The surnames adopted by Armenians in the first quarter of the 19th century predominantly fell into two categories:

1.  **Professional Names:** A significant portion of Armenian surnames reflected professions. Examples include:
    *   Pastırmacıyan (from *pastırmacı* - pastrami maker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Deveciyan (from *deveci* - camel driver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Nalbantyan (from *nalbant* - farrier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
    *   Terziyan (from *terzi* - tailor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

    This trend is attributed to Armenians frequently having specific professions, unlike Turks who often had official duties or were villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

2.  **Personal Characteristics:** Another common origin was based on personal attributes or physical traits. Examples include:
    *   Boduryan (from *bodur* - stunted/short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Boşgezenyan (from *boşgezen* - loquacious/idler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Çolakyan (from *çolak* - lame) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Surnames like "toothy" or "long" were also acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

A small minority adopted their father's name as a surname, such as Sarkisyan or Hagopyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Evolution and Modernization

While the earliest and "real old" [[Armenian_surnames_in_the_Ottoman_Empire|Armenian surnames]] were largely Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, some families with Turkish surnames later changed them to Armenian under the [[influence_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames|influence of modern nationalism]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. An example given is "jeweler" becoming Ken Vos Geriyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Iranian Armenians

Interestingly, [[comparison_between_ottoman_and_iranian_armenian_surnames|Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames shortly after their Ottoman counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The primary distinction lies in the suffix, where [[comparison_between_ottoman_and_iranian_armenian_surnames|Iranian Armenian surnames]] commonly end in "-yant" (with a 'T' sound) instead of "-yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This difference reflects the broader [[cultural_and_linguistic_shifts_among_armenians|cultural differences]] between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

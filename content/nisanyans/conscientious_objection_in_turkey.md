## Historical Context and Modernization Crisis
The emergence of conscientious objection in Turkey is seen as a crisis related to the country's modernization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. Historically, there is no deep-rooted tradition of conscientious objection in Turkey, unlike in Christian countries, including Tsarist Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>. In Christian nations, the separation of state and church allowed for a margin of flexibility, making it a known tradition for a small part of society to reject military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

In contrast, within the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Muslim tradition, being a Muslim was synonymous with being a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. The duty of physical combat (Jihad) was considered obligatory, and the concept of conscientious objection for Muslims was never recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. Turkey's attempt to abandon its old culture and adopt the behavioral patterns of Western cultures has led to stumbles, creating this crisis of conscientious objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. This highlights a dilemma: while seeking to be Westerners, Turks and Muslims are reluctant to give up certain conditions of their own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. The speaker references Ziya Gökalp's idea of adopting Western culture without being fully adopted by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

### Osman Murat and Early Objectors
Osman Murat is noted as the first person in Turkey to be imprisoned for conscientious objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:57">[01:23:57]</a>. His stance and struggle are described as honorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. In the 1980s and 90s, individual conscientious objectors, like Osman Murat, experienced great personal pain but were admired for their heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>. Their actions were considered the "greatest heroism" and the oppression they faced was condemned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

## Evolution of Military Service
The importance and seriousness of conscientious objection are gradually diminishing today due to changes in the nature of military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>. There has been a shift from general military recruitment and infantry roles towards professional soldiers and armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. In professional armies, the concept of conscientious objection is largely "off the agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. The Ukraine War, for example, is primarily fought by professional groups rather than the official Russian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.

## Personal Stance
The speaker views conscientious objection as an indispensable human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. Despite this, he encourages young men, including his own sons, to serve in the army for a period. He believes it is a valuable experience for self-discovery and understanding society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. This encouragement, however, does not imply any objection to the principle of conscientious objection itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.

## Broader Context
The political landscape in Turkey, as discussed in [[political_changes_in_turkey | Contemporary Turkish politics]], involves a shift in political discourse from intellectual leaders like Süleyman Demirel and Turgut Özal to figures like Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Devlet Bahçeli, which the speaker describes as a descent into "brainless, hateful, primitive concepts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. This broader context of political change and [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | historical continuity]] likely influences discussions and policies around rights such as conscientious objection.

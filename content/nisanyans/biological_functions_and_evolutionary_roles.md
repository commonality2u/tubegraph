Biological functions and evolutionary roles are presented as foundational to understanding the differences between men and women, challenging modern societal interpretations of gender roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.

## Fundamental Biological Differences
From a biological perspective, men and women possess different biological functions and genetic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. These differences bring about distinct psychological advantages and disadvantages for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:17">[02:11:17]</a>.

## Women's Primary Biological Function
The primary biological function of women is described as giving birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Following birth, a woman's duty includes ensuring the child's safety, looking after them, feeding them, and preventing their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This function is presented as a fundamental aspect of [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | a woman's life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

## Men's Complementary Role
Men are posited to have compensated for their biological dysfunctions, weaknesses, and insignificance in the biological field by developing skills and ambitions in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Human Nature as Animalistic
The discussion frames human beings as not fundamentally different from animals like monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The functions of men and women in mammals are considered very obvious and logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, with differences in procedures being obligatory due to biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

It is asserted that humans are essentially animals, akin to gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans, with some added "decorations" such as science, art, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The core function of a human being is stated to be sexual intercourse and [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, with men and women having different capabilities within these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Societal Interpretations vs. Biological Facts
The idea that a lack of achievements by [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | women]] in fields like arts, visual arts, music, or politics is due to oppression and male domination is dismissed as incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Instead, it is attributed to a lack of understanding of human psychology and the differing biological functions of men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

While acknowledging that [[social_roles_and_dynamics_in_various_regions | society]] today, influenced by [[role_of_technology_in_societal_evolution | technology]] and complex, unnatural qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, necessitates discussions about women's rights and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, these are considered secondary to the underlying biological reality of human beings as animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The current age is characterized as one that respects ideological lies more than objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, but the speaker maintains these biological facts are undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

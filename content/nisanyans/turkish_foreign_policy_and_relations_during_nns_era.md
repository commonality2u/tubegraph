Ismet İnönü's leadership significantly shaped [[geopolitical_strategies_and_foreign_relations_of_trkiye | Turkish foreign policy]] and international relations, particularly during and after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. An article written in 2018 highlighted his impact on the Republic's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Approach and Ideological Stance
İnönü was characterized as a cautious manager without a grand vision, or at least one he preferred not to vocalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. After 1930, he consistently maintained distance from "Turkism movements" that had spread across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. His stance led to "blood feud" with Turkists after he broke up pro-Nazi structures in [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | Turkey]] with arrests in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This opposition to Turkism became a major fault line in [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | Turkish politics]] after 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | Turkish Foreign Policy During World War II]]
İnönü is credited with keeping Turkey out of the disaster of the two World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. His decision to maintain neutrality during World War II is considered a significant service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Turkey's Neutrality
> The decision to remain neutral was crucial given the miserable state of the Turkish army in 1940, described as a "desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Entering the war, especially on the side of the Allies, was seen as a potential liability for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. The devastating consequences for countries like Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which experienced civil war and deep generational wounds after fighting, served as cautionary tales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. It is particularly hard to imagine the outcome had Turkey joined Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

Allies attempted to persuade Turkey to join the war, but a key diplomatic concern was preventing Germany's access to strategic minerals, such as chrome, from Turkey, which was vital for high-quality steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. İnönü is said to have pursued a "two-faced policy" at home to navigate the complex demands of pleasing both the British and Americans while keeping them at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. Once Germany's defeat became evident, pro-German elements like Saraçoğlu and Peker were purged, and a new government was formed to facilitate dialogue with the British and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>.

## Post-War Economic and Political Shifts
After 1946, with the United States opening credit lines, İnönü gave the green light for a rapid economic expansion policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This marked a shift from his earlier cautious financial policies in the 1930s and 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

The period after 1950, and especially after the 1960 coup, saw the expansion of the "cult of the founder God" (Atatürk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Despite İnönü's initial efforts to subtly reduce Atatürk's omnipresence post-1938 (e.g., removing his picture from money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>), this cult was revived with greater fury by the Democrat Party in 1950 to ensure national unity during a risky transition to a multi-party democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>. The aim was to make Atatürk's culture the "only unquestionable truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>.

## Ethnic Relations and Controversies
İnönü played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. However, he argued for moderation during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion, which led to his dismissal from office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The second and bloodier phase of the Dersim operation, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and family dislocations, occurred after İnönü was dismissed, under Atatürk's direct command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>.

### Greek Community Expulsion
The 1963-64 expulsion of the Greek community from Istanbul, involving around 50,000 people carrying Greek passports, was a response to escalating conflicts in Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. This event, which saw families divided and properties confiscated with minimal allowance for belongings, was described as a "very strange behavior by the standards of the two World Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>.

The expulsion was a form of retaliation for Cyprus incidents, specifically the breakdown of the two-community structure of the Republic of Cyprus established three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>. This incident also reflected the broader policy of consolidating non-Muslim populations in Istanbul, a policy that also saw the "purification" of Armenian communities in Anatolia during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] Treaty of Lausanne and Population Exchange
> The Treaty of Lausanne mandated the deportation and exchange of most of Turkey's Greek population, with exceptions for Imroz, Bozcaada, and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>. The continued presence of Greeks in Istanbul was linked to an agreement made in 1935, granting them the right to obtain Greek citizenship and promising non-discrimination in exchange for the untouched status of Turks in Western Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.

### Thracian Events of 1934
In 1934, amidst rising concerns about Germany's expansion towards Turkish borders, a policy decision was made at a high level to expel the Jewish population west of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:49:00">[57:49:00]</a>. This involved attacks on Jewish shops and individuals in areas like Edirne, Tekirdağ, and Çanakkale, with state authorities implicitly condoning these actions by denying protection to the Jewish community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. This policy, leading to confiscation of goods and displacement, contributed to consolidating the non-Muslim population in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The motivation behind this policy, whether "stupidity, racism, and hostility" or a "rational" necessity for state survival, remains a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

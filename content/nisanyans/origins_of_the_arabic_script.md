The [[impact_of_the_arabic_and_latin_alphabets | Arabic script]] as it is known today was first codified around 680 CE, during the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This codification, essentially the invention of the standardized [[impact_of_the_arabic_and_latin_alphabets | Arabic script]], was undertaken for the specific purpose of [[historical_and_religious_context_of_quran_writing | writing the Quran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## State of Arabic Before Codification

Before its codification, in the earlier period during the time of Muhammad and for 60 years following his death, the [[impact_of_the_arabic_and_latin_alphabets | Arabic script]] was rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It consisted primarily of graffiti and short scribbles of worship, typically 3 to 5 words long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The script lacked the dots and diacritics (movements) characteristic of modern Arabic, making it a "distorted version" suitable only for taking notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At this time, there were no literary works, letters, or formal texts written in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The prevailing idea that Arabic, considered a tribal language, could be a written language did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

During this period, the dominant written language in the Middle East was [[the_evolution_of_the_aramaic_language_and_its_historical_influence | Syriac script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This high-level, cultured script, comparable to Latin, was widely used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Quranic Texts and Codification

Claims that a commission was established during Muhammad's time or the subsequent period of Uthman to write down the Quran are considered fabrications, made approximately 180 years after the events, during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The psychological basis for such claims is the uneasiness surrounding the fact that the Quran was not written during Muhammad's time but much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Narratives of its writing during Uthman's time were propagated during the Abbasid era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Scientific and objective information indicates that the Quran was [[history_of_quran_codification | compiled]] around 680 CE during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Before this compilation, the Quranic content existed as memorized recitations, believed to be "extremely divine" and recited in mosques every Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, there is no reliable information regarding the authenticity of these oral transmissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

When the [[historical_and_religious_context_of_quran_writing | writing of the Quran]] began, different traditions and variations of verses existed across various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. These different interpretations were suppressed by the order of Hajjaj, and a standardized text was created to align with the political interests of the Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This standardized text emerged approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

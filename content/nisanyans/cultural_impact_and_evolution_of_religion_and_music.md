## Cultural Impact of Religion

The discussion touches on the profound [[Role of religion in personal and cultural identity|role of religion in personal and cultural identity]] and its historical influence.

### Religious Identity and Conversion
The speaker believes that after the age of 25, it is difficult for individuals to sincerely and honestly internalize a new religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. While personal crises, intellectual efforts, or social pressures might lead to a desire for conversion, true internalization, especially regarding sensitivities and prejudices formed in childhood, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. It is compared to learning a foreign language without an accent after 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

All religions are seen as based on irrational propositions that contradict reason and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. For example, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity is perceived as detrimental to reason, yet the speaker, having been exposed to it from a young age, feels an emotional closeness to the discourse surrounding it, finding it sympathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. Conversely, equally absurd claims of Islam, such as the creator of the universes giving a book to an Arab merchant, seem "unbearably absurd" to the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. This highlights how cultural tradition and early exposure shape one's sympathy towards religious narratives, regardless of their logical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Historical Religious Influence on Society and Economics

#### Protestantism and Capitalism
The relationship between Protestantism and capitalism gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initially in England and later in Germany, as part of a national competition to explain economic superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. The prevailing belief was that their Protestant faith made them more moral and thus better capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

A crucial, often overlooked, aspect is the emphasis on reading the holy book in Protestantism, unlike [[Catholic and Orthodox Churchs Sociological and Cultural Impact|Catholic tradition]] where only certain individuals read the scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Protestantism emerged with the printing press, leading to nearly 100% literacy rates in Protestant countries by the 16th century, while literacy in Catholic countries lagged until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. This difference fostered a distinct urban middle class and [[Cultural and societal transformations in the Western and Islamic worlds|different cultural developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.

#### Judaism and Capitalism
The role of Judaism in capitalism, particularly in the banking sector, which became a determining institution of capitalism, was almost entirely a Jewish phenomenon from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. While British established textile factories and Germans focused on steel, arms, and automobile industries, Jews established banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. As capitalism shifted from industry to finance, this aspect became more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>.

After 1945, it became considered shameful, and even legally forbidden, to discuss the relationship between capitalism and specific religious or ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. The impact of Jewish solidarity and national identity on the distribution and power of finance capital has been overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. The speaker believes this is changing, especially with the [[Influence of cultural and religious dynamics in the Middle East|Gaza War in the Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.

### Religious Origins of Wine
The earliest known wine sample was discovered in jars dating back to 4000 BCE in Areni, Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:40">[02:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>. However, no nation called Armenians existed in 4000 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>. Georgians also claim early wine production, with findings possibly dating to 5000 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:36">[02:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a>. Archaeological findings related to pottery in Iran (Hasanlı Tepe, Hacı Firuz Tepe, near Lake Urmia) go back to the Neolithic Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:07">[02:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:08">[02:03:08]</a>. The region encompassing Georgia, Armenia, and Iranian Azerbaijan appears to be where grape farming and wine production began around 4000-5000 BCE, coinciding with the invention of pottery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:22">[02:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[02:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>. The ethnic composition of the Near East 5,000 years ago, before the invention of writing, is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:50">[02:05:50]</a>.

## Music Appreciation and Evolution

### Johann Sebastian Bach
To understand the subtleties of music, particularly Bach, the speaker recommends active engagement rather than just reading about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. The speaker's personal experience with Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestra Suites was transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. A key event was listening to Bach's "Art of Fugue" while driving, where the listener can invent multiple accompanying voices beyond the written four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. This "explosion" of sound and unpredictable creativity is central to understanding his music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>.

Bach's music is characterized by its unpredictability; one can rarely guess the next melodic step, even if familiar with the piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>. Yet, after hearing the continuation, it feels undeniably correct, leading to a sense of "of course it should have been like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:46">[01:36:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:49">[01:36:49]</a>. This combination of unpredictability and inherent correctness is described as a "sign of genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>. Bach wrote over 1,100 works without a single boring passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:06">[01:39:06]</a>.

### Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Mozart possessed "very great emotional richness" in some works, creating beautiful sound combinations and melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. His later works, like *Don Giovanni* and his last 4-5 symphonies, are considered masterpieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:56">[01:37:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>. However, most of his output is described as "routine" and predictable, sometimes lacking the courage found in other composers, which can lead to boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

### Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
Tchaikovsky is characterized as a "very sweet nurturer" who aims to please the listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:19">[01:39:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. This desire to please is seen as a trait that "does not befit a great artist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>.

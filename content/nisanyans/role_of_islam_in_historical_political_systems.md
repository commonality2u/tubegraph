Throughout history, the role of Islam in shaping political systems has varied depending on how it was introduced to a region, whether through conquest or trade.

## Conquest and Dominance in Islamic Empires

In many regions, Islamic political traditions and legal systems became dominant for centuries following military conquest [01:03:42]. This included areas like Anatolia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, North Africa, and Spain [01:03:42]. The expansion of Islamic empires involved military colonization, similar to how the Spanish and Portuguese conquered South America [01:03:51].

Following conquest, the primary aim was to establish dominance as a ruling class and leverage the labor and productivity of local populations [01:04:31]. Despite military conquest, Islamic empires generally did not seek to destroy or forcibly convert Christians in these countries [01:04:05]. Instead, they permitted existing populations to maintain their religions and livelihoods, expecting tribute in return [01:05:45].

Remarkably, in many of these conquered lands, Muslims were initially a minority, yet held ruling power [01:04:56]. Examples include Baghdad during the time of Harun Rashid, Egypt during the Mamluk State (around 1200), and even the [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Ottoman Empire]] during the reign of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, where Muslims constituted a small minority [01:05:03]. In these systems, Muslims were the ones authorized to bear arms and hold ultimate authority [01:05:31].

## Religious Orders and Social Order

In the 19th century, particularly in the "Turkish Land," a significant social upheaval occurred after the collapse of the old Turkish aristocratic model [00:06:13]. During this period, the Halidi order and tradition played a crucial role in the "recovery of Islamic fanaticism" and the restoration of a social order within the framework of Islamic belief and organization [00:06:23]. This demonstrates the role of religious orders in re-establishing social and political stability.

## Islam's Role in Regions of Trade and Minority Influence

In contrast to conquered lands, Islam also spread through trade and peaceful migration in other regions, where its role in political systems differed significantly [01:06:11]. In places like Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, Indonesia, and Malaysia, Muslims often arrived as merchants and maintained a minority status with certain privileges within society, but without political sovereignty [01:06:16].

For example, in Ethiopia, the mountainous regions, which were the homeland of the kingdom, were primarily Christian, with Christians making up the landowning, farming, administrative, and educated classes [01:06:32]. Muslims, however, were predominantly bazaar shopkeepers and merchants in towns [01:07:05]. This dynamic is described as the exact opposite of the [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Ottoman Empire]]'s situation where Armenians often held similar commercial roles [01:07:22]. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, the state and most villagers were Buddhist, while Muslims predominantly ran jewelry shops, street vending, hotels, and grocery stores in towns [01:08:28].

## Spiritual Influence and Societal Function

The discussion also touches on the broader [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | role of religion in society]], highlighting the spiritual impact of religious sites on people, irrespective of their personal beliefs [00:03:35]. The ability of religious communities, such as the Naqshbandi community (especially the Ismail Aga Community), to organize and support individuals, particularly the "lonely, hopeless people" in prisons, is noted [01:10:50]. This demonstrates a societal function beyond formal political power, providing spiritual and psychological support to those abandoned by society [01:11:19]. The speaker posits that understanding how people maintain their lives with spiritual support is crucial for comprehending societal dynamics [01:11:47].

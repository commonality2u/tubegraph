The following article, originally written on May 19, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, explores criticisms of Kemalism and its contemporary manifestations in Trkiye. The author poses a hypothetical question: "What kind of policy would you have followed if you were in [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal's]] place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, framing the discussion around the pragmatic necessities of statecraft during a period of collapse and the enduring legacy of an ideology.

## Historical Context and Pragmatism

The fundamental assumptions for a leader in a collapsed state are to re-establish the state's power and to protect one's own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The author suggests that a leader in such a situation would naturally pursue these objectives:
*   **Creating National Excitement** Even if artificial, a sense of national excitement would be fostered in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While elites in Istanbul and Izmir might be lukewarm, ordinary citizens would be swayed by narratives of homeland, nation, and victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Political Intrigue and Terror** Drawing on the existing tradition of intrigue from the [[Unionism and Kemalism in Turkish politics | Union and Progress]] (Ittihad-ı Terakki) organization, a leader might resort to political terror, including executions, to deter disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Maneuvering** In a world of shifting global powers, a middle ground would be sought between competing ideologies like British liberalism and German Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Opportunistically, territory might be claimed if a power like France was seen to be weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Post-1929 Actions and Criticisms

The article questions whether certain actions taken by [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal]] after 1929-1930 could be considered signs of madness, including:
*   Theories of language and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   The Dersim massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   The liquidation of İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   The purchase of the Savarona yacht, described as one of the "most despicable and most pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This act, driven by megalomania, involved a chain of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   The decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

The author suggests that it is difficult to protect oneself from the corrupting effect of absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This perspective is extended to other historical figures like Abdülhamid and [[Criticism of Recep Tayyip Erdoan and Turkish political dynamics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], who also faced the challenge of preserving state power and their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Modern Kemalism: A Pathology

The core problem, according to the article, lies not with [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal]] himself, but with his modern disciples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal's]] "crime" was making arrogance and insult the main axis of Turkish political language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, a tradition intensified after the 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Modern Kemalism is described as:
*   A "sacred holy icon" that symbolizes contemporary Turkish racism and state gatekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   Justifying "all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Represented by "half-educated" elites who "spew hatred and complexes against the outside world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Having failed to establish emotional communication with common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   A "pathology," a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   A "[[Contemporary Turkish politics and Islamic influence in state ideology | Kemalist sect]]" that rejects Islam and positions itself as an alternative to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   Based on "Hakime arrogance" ("we are right, the other is sharpened"), which renders its adherents incapable of understanding the rights of Turks or connecting emotionally with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This arrogance also prevents them from understanding modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Civil servants who "worship icons" and act with a "disgusting attitude," believing their actions are beyond reason or conscience because they "represent the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This is described as a "disgusting feeling" for the author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## Mustafa Kemal's Purge of the Old Cadres

The article also touches on the 1926 Izmir assassination attempt, suggesting it was potentially an excuse to intimidate the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. While an actual plot may have existed, it was "evaluated as a blessing from God" and used to eliminate the old Ittihad-ı Terakki cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. This included key figures who had funded the National Struggle, such as Minister of Finance Mr. Cavit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, and those who organized the Istanbul operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. All seven signatories of the Amasya Declaration, including Kazım Karabekir, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and Rauf Orbay, were tried with death penalty, although none were executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This purge is likened to Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, illustrating that "the cadres who made the revolution and the cadres who will be in power do not have the same characteristics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## The Impossibility of a "New Kemalism"

The author believes that the idea of a "new and democratic Kemalism" is a "complete dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Young secular academics promoting this idea are seen as marginalized, out of touch with the country, and holding a deep hatred for the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The notion of a "totalitarian dictator of the 1930s becoming a more democratic symbol is an absurd idea," one that has failed for a hundred years and will not succeed now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Broader Socio-Political Analysis

The article emphasizes that governing a state is a science with objective laws, and even radical dreams must bow to the logic of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It contends that if someone else had been in [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal's]] place in 1919 or 1923, the outcome would have been largely similar due to the underlying logic of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

The Ottoman administration, in its traditional form, effectively ended in 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Sultan Reşat was a powerless figurehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The [[Unionism and Kemalism in Turkish politics | Union and Progress]] team suffered military defeat, leading to the empire's collapse and transformation into a nation-state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This was part of a broader regional trend where empires and dynasties fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

Trkiye's process of adopting Islam as the official state ideology is seen as irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The "modernizing class" has failed to benefit the country or realize its claims of raising it to contemporary civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Trkiye has entered a search for a new route and structure, making a return to Kemalist culture a "very, very distant possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

The author argues that there has never been widespread popular Islamic fanaticism in Trkiye; rather, a "state tradition since Byzantium" has seen a ruling elite consistently adopting Western models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Trkiye has historically been the "most open face of the Islamic world to the West," adopting innovations from printing presses to new military organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Until just before [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy | Mustafa Kemal's]] era, 25% of Trkiye's population and over 30% of its economic structure were non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

The current global and Western political systems are seen as rapidly heading towards an "explosion" due to inadequate existing thought systems and political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. There is a need for a new "ideal" or "alternative administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. In the absence of such an alternative, the author finds no other solution than Islam as an idea to unite and define the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This sentiment extends across the Islamic world, where people believe "the solution lies in Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

The question of the Kurds' involvement in the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian genocide]] has been raised, with figures like Besim Tibuk suggesting Kurds should confront this history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This is considered a significant and complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Context Before 1915

The [[armenian_genocide | Armenian incident]] of 1915 is not an isolated event but rather the "final blow" or "finishing move" of a century-long process involving massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Prior to 1915, the primary oppressor of Armenians, causing them to flee their homeland, was identified as the Kurdish element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Kurds, particularly those under the control of tribal leaders and later sect sheikhs, were adept at killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For a significant period, up until the last quarter of the 19th century, Armenians often sought the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman State]] (Turks) as their allies and protectors against Kurdish aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It was common for Armenians to seek refuge with the Ottoman governor against attacks from Kurdish chieftains (aghas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Around 1880, there was a noticeable hostility directed more towards the Armenian Church than the Armenian nation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Kurdish Involvement in 1915

The events of 1915 represent a conscious and cold-blooded "annihilation project" undertaken by the Union and Progress administration of the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Turkish state]] and the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Ottoman state]] bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The objective was to completely "cleanse" the "Armenian problem" that had troubled the Ottomans for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In this process, the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Turkish state]] utilized Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish populace as allies, helpers, and subcontractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an existing tradition of massacre and extortion among Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The state successfully leveraged this in the Eastern provinces, effectively granting permission for Kurds to act without fear of judgment for crimes committed against Armenians, by signaling that the state supported them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## [[change_in_kurdish_perspective_on_armenian_issues | Change in Kurdish Perspective]]

A shift in Kurdish awareness occurred after the high school system was abolished, which led to a cessation of widespread looting in Anatolian countryside, as there was no more property or women to usurp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Following this, Kurds realized they were directly confronting the [[ottoman_state_policies_towards_armenians_and_kurds | Turkish state]] and faced potential destruction themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

More recently, over the last 20-30 years, the attitude and approach of Kurds towards the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian issue]] have undergone a radical and appreciable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It is suggested that Turks could benefit from overcoming their own prejudices and ignorance in a similar way to the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

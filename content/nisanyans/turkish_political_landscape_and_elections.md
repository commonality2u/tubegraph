From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker begins by noting a complaint from "Our President" regarding those who make judgments with a glass of whiskey in their hand, which was seen as an indication that the President watches their programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Electoral Stance
The speaker revealed their vote color on Twitter, stating their intention to cast one vote for Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and one vote for the Green Left Party, which is the adopted name of the dear HDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Concerns and Doubts
The speaker has repeatedly expressed concerns and doubts regarding Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, specifically stating that:
*   He could win the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   He does not believe Kılıçdaroğlu can successfully come to power or perform well if he wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The speaker has not changed their mind on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Critique of the Current Government
The speaker believes that the head of the current government, Tayyip Erdoğan, and his right-hand assistant, Bahçeli, have "really screwed things up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It is believed that it is time for this 20-year-long government to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   A month prior, the speaker was 50-50 on the matter, but recent statements and attitudes, particularly after the earthquake, solidified this belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   In the first ten years of his rule, Tayyip Erdoğan performed "revolutionary work" for [[Turkeys political landscape after recent elections | Turkey]], introducing a certain relaxation and transformation in the previously "frozen and hardened" structure of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   However, the country's situation in recent years, especially after the transition to the presidential system, is deemed intolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   The moral and intellectual weaknesses of the leader have gotten out of hand due to long-term rule, reaching an uncontrollable point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Bahçeli's current state is described as "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   The speaker questions how much longer [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] can tolerate such "nonsense" and "perpetual ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Hopes for the Elections
There is a hope for a calm and successful election in the coming week, with a result that satisfies everyone, including supporters of the current regime, who might acknowledge it as a fair election where the "men won" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. However, the speaker's hopes on this issue are "not very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Prediction for Tayyip Erdoğan's Future
The speaker believes Tayyip Erdoğan will leave power in the not-so-distant future, though whether it will be through elections or other methods, or if Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu or someone else will replace him, remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. From the speaker's perspective, Tayyip Erdoğan's "expiration date has expired for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Factors Influencing the Speaker's Vote
The speaker openly shares their doubts, speculations, and uncertainties regarding the [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | Turkish political climate and elections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
1.  **Historical Bloc:** The traditional historical bloc represented by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's party is not considered superior to the Islamist bloc in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Having followed [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | politics in this country]] since the 1960s, the speaker notes that [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] was not a good place before Tayyip Erdoğan, and has not been a good place since 1920, except for short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. A political movement that does not openly confront this past is deemed unreliable, regardless of its apparent civility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
2.  **Governing Coalitions:** A party that must rely on both the HDP and a party like the İyi Party (representing [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkey]]'s fascist tradition) to govern is not believed to be on the right track or capable of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
3.  **Global Transformation and Foreign Policy:** In an era of rapid global transformation, the political line [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkey]] has adopted in recent years is considered right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. However, there are doubts about how long a new government would want to continue this line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Despite these reasons, the speaker will vote for Kılıçdaroğlu and encourage relatives to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The speaker does not believe the current leaders will leave power unless forced or under strong pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, recalling an incident in 1969/70 where Necmettin Erbakan was forcibly removed from his presidency of the Union of Chambers despite losing an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Police State and Mafia Relations
A viewer's question about the similarity between state and mafia relations in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]] is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The speaker asserts that the concept of a "free market" is over globally, with state bureaucracy and intelligence agencies gaining unprecedented economic and political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   Capitalists can only control the state through close relations and grow to the extent they are not prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   The enormous power of private capital and state bureaucracies are intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   An oligarchy disconnected from society maintains dominance through an "extremely violent, extremely armed and extremely ruthless police force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   The phenomena of the Police State, Mafia State, and Bureaucracy State are considered the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   The speaker defines a police state as a constant threat and presence of police in every moment of life, not just in [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkey]] but terribly so in Western countries too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   A good police regime, in the speaker's view, would be one where the police are never seen by normal citizens in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   Police violence and unpunished police murders have reached incomprehensible levels, especially in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   The COVID-19 pandemic led to an "absurd point" where police powers, already out of control, were used to restrict basic freedoms, such as arresting individuals for not wearing masks on a beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

### Public Passivity
The speaker discusses a viewer's question about whether a country or society can be so "cowardly" or "passive" and why the collective mind that united during past events (like the Gezi protests) is absent today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   In the Western world, taking to the streets for demonstrations has little use, as the police have the power to suppress them, as seen in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
*   Across many countries, including [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkey]], France, Germany, England, and the U.S., there is no exciting alternative that would inspire people to risk their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   The [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | political party]] struggle has devolved into a "Karagöz Hacivat" (shadow play) performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   Social media provides a "toy" where people engage in virtual fights and shouts, without real-world political equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
*   The speaker predicts that while things will not continue as they are, significant change is not expected in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

## Conclusion
The program will not be held next week due to the upcoming elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.

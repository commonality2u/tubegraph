The podcast host has recently relocated to a new, quieter home in [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] for the summer. This move was made from their previous "winter house," where they had resided for eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The decision to move was prompted by the previous location being very touristic during the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The New Home in Montenegro

The new residence is described as a "wonderful place" and a "very beautiful place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is located in a village called [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]], which has a population of approximately 200 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This village is quite remote, situated directly on the bank of a beautiful river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Notable features of the new location include:
*   A 500-year-old stone bridge directly in front of the residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The presence of geese and ducks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Opportunities for canoeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   "Incredibly high" internet speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The host expresses admiration for the new location and intends to share images and videos of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. They also mentioned the possibility of making a video to share the beauty of the new place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:12">[01:47:12]</a>.

## Moving Challenges

The recent move to [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] was the fourth move in the host's recent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>. Despite having aimed not to accumulate too many belongings, they found that a truck full of items had accumulated without them realizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>. The host admits that the moving process has been "a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:48">[01:46:48]</a>.

## Montenegro as a Safe Place

In a broader discussion about global conflicts and potential safe havens, [[the_podcast_hosts_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] was listed as a potentially safe place, though with a caveat about a foreigner's ability to live there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>.

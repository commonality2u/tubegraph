From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker recently watched the Iranian film *Leila's Brothers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, which was recommended by a friend on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The film was released in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

It was described as an "extraordinary movie" and "a very good movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The speaker considers it the best movie they have seen in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It is a long film, exceeding 2.5 hours in duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Qualities of Iranian Cinema

The speaker draws a comparison between the caliber of films like *Leila's Brothers* and the works of 19th and early 20th-century European theater writers such as Anton Chekhov and Tennessee Williams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Films of this "caliber," "subtlety," and "humane and emotionally loaded" quality are considered "impossible in the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, with Western culture being described as "an exhausted culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While some beautiful movies come from Russia, the unique qualities of Iranian cinema are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The "sensitivity of Iranian movies" and "their ability to grasp and reflect the subtleties of human relations is really admirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The recommendation is to "watch them, don't miss them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

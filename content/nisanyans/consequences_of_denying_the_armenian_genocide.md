April 24 is commemorated globally, especially in Armenia, as the day of the 1915 [[Armenian Genocide]] commemoration [00:00:09]-[00:00:13]. This event is deeply emotional, with the entire population walking to the monument on a hill [00:00:19]-[00:00:26].

## The Events of April 24, 1915

The date April 24 marks a political step that preceded the [[Armenian Genocide]] itself [00:01:17]-[00:01:20]. On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and other major Ottoman cities, approximately 235-250 prominent figures of the Armenian community were arrested [00:01:35]-[00:02:14]. These included writers, intellectual leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters [00:01:54]-[00:02:06]. They were rounded up from their homes, streets, and restaurants [00:02:17]-[00:02:20]. A few days later, some were sent to Ayaş and Çankırı in Anatolia [00:02:23]-[00:02:26]. While some managed to escape, others were never heard from again and were killed [00:02:30]-[00:02:36].

This was a "political collapse operation" aimed at cleansing the political leaders and voices of Armenian society, akin to operations seen throughout the history of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman period [00:02:58]-[00:03:04], [00:04:20]-[00:04:28]. The arrests included individuals strongly against extremist Armenian movements and those with no organizational ties [00:03:25]-[00:03:34]. Similar operations occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat, with accounts of prominent figures being called to the governor's office, killed, and disposed of [00:03:47]-[00:04:16].

Following these initial arrests in May, the situation escalated into the deportation of civilians, women, and children across the country, gradually turning into a mass murder and massacre [00:04:35]-[00:04:53].

## The Policy of Denial

The Turkish state's policy regarding the [[Armenian Genocide]] evolved over time. Until 1975, and especially until 1965, Turkey maintained a policy of silence, believing it unnecessary to discuss the subject [00:09:41]-[00:10:09]. This silence was partly due to Turkey's high reputation in the Western world before the 1960s [00:11:11]-[00:11:20], [00:11:30].

A turning point occurred in 1965, when the [[Armenian Genocide]] came back to the global agenda, initiated by the Soviet Union in Soviet Armenia on the 50th anniversary [00:10:34]-[00:10:54]. Despite some minor reactions within Turkey, the state continued its policy of silence [00:10:57]-[00:11:08].

However, around 1974-75, following Turkey's Cyprus operation, the issue suddenly erupted in the Western world [00:11:36]-[00:11:39]. The emergence of ASALA, an organization that attacked Turkish institutions and embassies, led to the [[Armenian Genocide]] being widely remembered in the Western press [00:11:49]-[00:12:02]. At this point, Turkey adopted a policy of systematic denial [00:12:08]-[00:12:12], [00:13:07]-[00:13:17]. This denial policy, designed by figures like Coşkun Kırca and Kamuran İnan, was deemed a "fiasco" and "stupidity" [00:12:29]-[00:13:05], [00:12:29]-[00:12:34], [00:13:22]-[00:13:26].

After 1974, Turkey's international standing in the Western world significantly declined following the Cyprus incident [00:13:36]-[00:13:59]. A "strong wind" of opposition began to blow against Turkey in Western countries, and its denial of a "past crime," which the whole world knew to be true, became a convenient excuse to provoke and harm Turkey [00:14:15]-[00:14:52].

### Consequences of Denial for Turkey

The speaker argues that denying the [[Armenian Genocide]] is a "waste of time," "ignorance," and "immoral" [00:07:33]-[00:08:06]. The fact of the genocide is widely known globally, except within Turkey itself [00:08:09]-[00:08:24]. The denial of the systematic plan to eliminate the Armenian and non-Muslim population of Anatolia since 1895, consciously put into practice in 1915, renders further discussion pointless [00:08:39]-[00:09:13], [00:09:17]-[00:09:30].

From 2005 to 2011, a brief period of hope emerged within Turkey for confronting this historical event [00:15:10]-[00:15:18]. Mainstream Turkish media and opinion leaders, from both right and left, began discussing the incident openly [00:15:45]-[00:16:19]. There was a growing sentiment to acknowledge the "terrible thing" that had occurred, where "millions of Armenians... were miserable, destroyed, expelled" [00:16:23]-[00:16:38]. It was understood that this was a "shame" and a matter of "conscience" [00:16:44]-[00:16:47].

Had Turkey shown the courage to take this step, it would have been "much better for Turkey" [00:17:01]-[00:17:05]. It would have shed a "heavy burden" of hypocrisy and taken a step towards overcoming the [[Armenian Genocide]] as an "obsession" or "mental illness" it has carried for 107 years [00:17:22]-[00:17:32].

The speaker personally struggled with this issue in Turkey until around 2014, believing that Turkey's confrontation with this issue was essential for its own health as a society [00:18:04]-[00:18:20], [00:18:32]-[00:18:38]. The [[Armenian Genocide]] is considered the most significant social and political event of 20th-century Turkey, fundamentally changing its societal composition and forming the psychological and economic basis of its political structures [00:19:51]-[00:20:13]. The cleansing of Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian populations represents Turkey's greatest trauma [00:20:28]-[00:20:33].

The policy of eliminating non-Muslim populations was advocated since the 1890s under Abdulhamid [00:20:42]-[00:20:47]. Although the Union and Progress administration initially held an optimistic approach after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, they eventually reverted to the "Abdulhamid project" by 1909-1910 [00:21:02]-[00:21:28]. By 1910-1911, the belief emerged that a "new Turkey could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims" [00:22:03]-[00:22:07]. By 1913, after the Balkan War and the Union and Progress cadres returned to power, the plans for the 1915 cleansing of Anatolia were ready [00:22:12]-[00:22:43].

Unlike population exchanges with Greece (Turks from Rumelia, Circassians from the Caucasus, Greeks from Turkey), where land was available for resettlement, there was no place for Armenians to go [00:22:49]-[00:24:08]. Deporting them to areas like Syria was initially considered, but the situation spiraled into massacres, largely to prevent future claims for compensation, land, or property [00:24:52]-[00:25:54].

Ultimately, the speaker concludes that as long as denial persists, the issue remains an "unsolved Blind Knot" [00:27:02]-[00:27:04]. While Turkey might feel it "overcame this crisis" and "nothing happened in the end," an opportunity for true progress and new horizons was lost due to this "stupid policy" of denial [00:27:17]-[00:27:41].

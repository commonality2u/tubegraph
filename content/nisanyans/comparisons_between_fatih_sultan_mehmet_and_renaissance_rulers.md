The question of whether Fatih Sultan Mehmet was an intellectual, extremely cultured, and omniscient individual is addressed by examining historical portrayals of rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Historical Portrayal of Rulers
Ancient and medieval historians frequently used stereotyped sentences and eulogies when writing about rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This practice was common for Roman emperors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, Byzantine emperors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, Abbasid caliphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, and medieval Turkish states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A sultan was often presented as an example, either positive or negative, to influence perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If a sultan was disliked, historians would exaggerate their negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Sources on Fatih Sultan Mehmet
Information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet from Turkish Ottoman sources is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Notable Turkish sources include the history by Aşıkpaşazade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> and histories written shortly after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These official histories of the Ottoman dynasty were produced towards the end of Fatih's era (the 1460s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The attitude of Turkish historians towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet in official histories is described as ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Fatih was not a beloved Sultan, especially towards the end of his rule, and was identified with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He reportedly suppressed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property, and executing many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His 30-year reign was characterized by constant warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

More detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet comes from Byzantine historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The two main Byzantine sources are Halkokondylis and Ducas, who lived during Fatih's time, met him personally, and were aware of his palace affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Renaissance Rulers

### The Role of Byzantine Historians
Byzantine historians like Halkokondylis and Ducas wrote praises of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, often with political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. They had close relations with Italian states like Genoa and Venice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Their writings often aimed to defend Italian interests within the Ottoman palace or establish alliances and rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy, reflecting the complex diplomatic realities of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Ottoman state was not isolated but engaged in intense relations with various Italian states that were often at war with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Clichés and Historical Scrutiny
In this complex historical context, certain cliché expressions about Fatih Sultan Mehmet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. These included comparisons to rulers of the Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and claims that he knew Latin and Italian and was aware of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

A good historian's reaction to such claims is not to question their truth immediately, but to ask *why* these statements were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Statements about sultans and state administrators are often cliché, serving either in their favor or against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Examples of such clichés include assertions of extreme religiosity despite rumors to the contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, claims of being a poet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, or even personally drawing architectural plans for major projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

It is difficult to ascertain the truth of these quoted sentences, as verifying them would require direct, face-to-face interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Information about state rulers is often disseminated through intermediaries, making it challenging to trace its accuracy centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

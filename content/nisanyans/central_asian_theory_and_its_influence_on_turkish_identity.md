The concept of [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]] as a unifying element for citizenship in Türkiye was foundational to the republic established in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Initially, the hope was that this shared identity would hold the country together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

## Early Republic's Definition of Turkishness (1923-1932)

In the early years of the Republic, specifically throughout the 1920s until 1932, the "Central Asian theory" was not part of official state publications or the discourse of Atatürk's relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. During this period, the definition of Turkishness was broad: "anyone who adopts the Turkish language, Turkish culture, Turkish, or the Turkish national ideal is Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This implicitly included non-Muslims as Turkish, regardless of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Radical Shift: Emergence of the Central Asian Theory (Post-1932)

A significant and radical change occurred around 1932-1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. By the winter of 1932-1933, a new historical narrative emerged, suggesting a racist theory that Turks originated from Central Asia and that all world civilizations were founded by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. From 1933 onwards, this "Central Asian theory" became the official state ideology, notably promoted through the First Turkish Language Congress and the First Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

There were three primary reasons for this radical change in the definition of [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]]:

### 1. [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | European Influences]]
In 1933, Hitler's rise to power in Germany shifted global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>. Previously, in 1923, Türkiye had considered models like the Soviet and, more importantly, the Mussolini model, which emphasized a single leader's will dominating society to achieve reforms, summarized as "Italianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. After 1933, [[influence_of_nationalism_in_turkish_politics | racism]] gained ground in Europe, and the idea of "purity" suddenly dominated world discourse, aligning with the perceived "wave of the future" of Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. This external shift was quickly noted in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>.

### 2. Internal Political Balances
The Central Asian theory, tracing [[historical_turkic_migrations_and_their_impact | Turks]] to Central Asia, was popular among "Progress cadres," particularly within the Turkish Hearth movements in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. This thesis was silenced after 1922-1923, with the Turkism of the Union and Progress party being "defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:52">[03:52:52]</a>. However, from 1932 onwards, these previously silenced cadres re-emerged, suggesting a change in internal political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:23">[04:23:23]</a>.

### 3. Need for a More Unifying Ideology
The founding ideology of the republic was deemed insufficient to politically hold the country together, lacking convincing power or broad appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:41">[04:41:41]</a>. It mainly resonated with educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments, failing to connect with wider society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:09">[05:09:09]</a>. By 1930-1931, the regime faced turmoil, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:18">[05:18:18]</a>. The leadership concluded that a return to Turkism would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. The "statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian ideology" of the republic's founding was distinct from the "racist Turkist ideology" implemented in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:46">[05:46:46]</a>.

## Impact and Assimilation Efforts

The adoption of the Central Asian theory led to assimilation projects, particularly targeting groups like the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:43">[06:43:43]</a>. The hope was to assimilate them within one or two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:53">[06:53:53]</a>. However, the Kurds proved "stubborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. The Turkish state, specifically the republican regime's "fascist dynamism" of the 1920s and early 1930s, eventually "loosened its muscles" and was unable to carry out the assimilation project fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:10">[07:10:10]</a>. A significant migration occurred from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, with [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurdish]] upper classes sending their children to schools in these major cities and gradually disappearing from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:48">[07:48:48]</a>.

## Comparisons to Other Countries

Such nationalistic and historical revisionist tendencies are not unique to Türkiye. Many countries in the region exhibit similar "stupidity and immorality" in their minority policies and attempts to invent artificial histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:33">[08:33:33]</a>. This includes the minority policies of Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:02">[09:02:02]</a>. The "somersaults" these countries perform to create their own histories are striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:16">[09:16:16]</a>.

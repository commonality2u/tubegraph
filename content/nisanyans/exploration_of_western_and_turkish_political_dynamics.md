## Western Political Dynamics

### United States: The January 6 Capitol Incident

In recent days, what is deemed the most significant political news has originated not from Türkiye, but from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The focus is on the January 6 Capitol incident, which occurred two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

#### Official Narrative vs. Revelations
The American administration has actively sought to portray the January 6 event as the most substantial organized rebellion against the state in U.S. history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. However, newly released security camera footage, obtained after 10,000 hours of recordings were somehow conveyed to journalists, casts doubt on this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Key discrepancies include:
*   **Police Casualties:** Initial claims of five police officers killed were reduced to one, and even that individual's death was not due to being struck on the head as previously claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It's suggested that five police officers involved in the incident committed suicide, raising questions about the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Officer Behavior:** The police officer initially reported to have been hit with a fire extinguisher appears calm and unharmed in the security footage, walking around the corridors before and after the alleged incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **"Horned Man" Figure:** A prominent figure, known for wearing horns and furs, was clearly seen throughout the process accompanied by 6-7, or even 10, police officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. He calmly walked around the parliament building, joking and chatting with officers who showed him the way, with no attempt to stop or catch him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. He even thanked "our police brothers for this nice behavior" from the Senate podium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Provocateur's Identity:** A man who actively encouraged people to storm the Capitol with strong, provocative rhetoric was never investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Attempts to investigate him were silenced, and it was later revealed he had previously worked for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The American press subsequently published articles sympathizing with him, claiming deep psychological depression due to the accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The emerging evidence suggests that the January 6 incident was a conscious and systematic raid on Congress by elements within the American police and FBI, controlled by specific powers, to discredit and potentially prosecute Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

#### Consequences for American Democracy
Following the broadcast of this program, representatives from both U.S. parties condemned the airing of these images, calling it "a great threat to American democracy" and "a terrible crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. They demanded that the channel and program owner be punished and fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This strong pressure to punish a television presenter for revealing information outside the official state discourse challenges the notion of the U.S. as a democratic country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Decline of Western Democracy
The speaker argues that the idea of Western democracy, as perceived in the past, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Today, there is no democracy in any sense of the word in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This contrasts with a simpler world where Western democracy was seen as a standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Greece: Escalating Police Terror
In Greece, an unprecedented level of police terror is being observed, reminiscent of the Cunda period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. An incredibly numerous and powerful police force violently attacks all forms of social unrest, disregarding existing laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The increasing dose of violence and a state of panic suggest that governing bureaucracies are in serious fear, attempting to suppress potential explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This situation points towards a "fascist dictatorship itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Western Alliance: Turkey's Shifting Stance
Türkiye's political landscape, while seemingly distinct, often mirrors Western trends with a delay of three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The idea of "being Western" or "democrats" is becoming obsolete as such models no longer exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

#### Drifting Away from the West
Türkiye's drifting away from the Western alliance is seen as a rational, correct, and smart policy, not merely a deviation by Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. The analogy used is that of leaving a sinking ship to save one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. A changing government is unlikely to alter this fundamental stance, though its diplomatic skill would be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>.

#### New Economic Opportunities
The Western world is seen as financially exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>. In contrast, countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Qatar offer substantial economic opportunities incomparable to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. The idea that Western countries would "pour money" into Türkiye is dismissed, as they themselves face an unprecedented economic crisis, particularly the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.

A significant development is the Saudi-Iran rapprochement, sponsored by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>. This move is predicted to deliver a final blow to American hegemony in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. Saudi Arabia's financial power combined with Iran's population, social cohesion, and military technology will create a major shift in global balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This alliance will break the economic embargo on Iran, providing it with financial resources and trade access, fundamentally changing many dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. It is viewed as "a nail driven into the coffin of the Western alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

This also relates to a serious project for a trade and transportation route dividing Asia, starting from China and reaching Iran, then extending to Middle Eastern countries and potentially Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. Türkiye, given its indispensable geographical location, will have to decide how long it can resist or if it will join this emerging locomotive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.

## Turkish Political Dynamics

### Upcoming Elections and Predictions
The speaker expresses reluctance to comment on [[political_issues | political issues]] due to past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, there's insistent demand from citizens for such commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Regarding the upcoming May elections, the speaker holds a pessimistic view for the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

#### Kılıçdaroğlu's Political Trajectory
While some respected individuals believe [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] might be a successful politician, the speaker has not seen convincing evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Kılıçdaroğlu has consistently garnered 22-26% of votes in elections over 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. For voting behavior to change, a new alternative with a different face and identity is needed, not just dissatisfaction with the current leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Without such a new factor, the speaker believes the opposition will lose the May elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Despite hoping for an opposition win due to general fatigue with Tayyip Erdoğan, the speaker still plans to vote for the opposition, albeit with some doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

#### Uncertainty Regarding the Ruling Party's Candidate
The official presidential candidate for the People's Alliance has not yet been announced, despite statements from Devlet Bahçeli that are not taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. With only two months until the election, this lack of clarity is highly unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. The speaker wonders if an unexpected candidate might be put forward at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

#### Doubts about Election Integrity
Serious doubts persist about whether the election will truly take place or be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. The current [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | political landscape]] is described as a "very obvious dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

#### Conditions for Overthrowing a Dictatorship
To end a dictatorship through elections, very strong "trump cards" are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>:
1.  **Public Uprising:** A large public uprising where security forces struggle to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
2.  **Military Support:** A significant portion of the military siding with the opposition, indicating potential armed conflict if elections fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
3.  **International Pressure:** Foreign powers, holding influence over the state, demanding elections and a change in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

None of these conditions are currently met in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The ability of foreign powers to control events in Türkiye is also significantly diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Therefore, expecting a change of power through elections under these circumstances is deemed unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

### Historical Political Movements and Coups

#### March 12 Memorandum and its Aftermath
March 12 marks the anniversary of the 1971 military memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. The speaker recalls waking up to news of the military memorandum, which led to the resignation of the Süleyman Demirel government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. A "reform government" led by Nihat Erim, composed of technocrats freshly imported from America, was initially formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. However, this government soon declared martial law, establishing a "regime of terror" that purged progressive and Atatürkist cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. The country was then governed by figures described as "worst kinds of police chiefs, torturers" until the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

Later revelations by Süleyman Demirel's disciple, Cüneyt Arcayürek, indicated that the coup involved an initial attempt by leftist officers which was stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. A joint coup on a common platform then took place, after which the leftist elements were eliminated, and a radical right-wing nationalist group took control, believing that "this nation only understands sticks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

#### Lessons from Past Military Interventions
The speaker also discusses the hypothetical scenario of a March 9 coup, which would have been led by Air Force Commander Batur and Land Forces Commander Gürler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. However, in a country under NATO control with limited autonomy in international relations, such a coup was deemed impossible to fundamentally alter the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Any initial "leftist ideas" would have been short-lived, and the Republic of Turkey would have returned to its "factory settings," similar to the March 12 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

This pattern is also seen in the May 27, 1960, coup, which was initially radical and aimed to establish an Atatürkist officers' regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. However, within months, these progressive elements were purged, replaced by a more conservative order aligned with capitalism and NATO's basic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. The same process recurred in October 1960 and March 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. Even if the March 9 coup had succeeded, the fundamental outcome would likely have been the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

### Identity Politics: Alevi and Kurdish Issues

#### Challenges for a Kurdish or Alevi President
The question of why an Alevi and/or Kurdish president cannot be elected in Türkiye is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Turgut Özal, despite his Kurdish background, became president by downplaying his identity, never making his Kurdishness an issue, and proving loyalty to the state and its "Turkishness and Islam" line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. Similarly, the current government has a strong wing of Kurdish origin, holding key positions, but they do not highlight their Kurdish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. The [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkish state]] has historically not allowed individuals who emphasize their Kurdish identity to hold important public office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.

#### Historical Context of Conflict
The historical relationship between the Turkish state and both Alevis and Sunni Kurds is marked by conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Alevis have been continuously suppressed, intimidated, and silenced by the Ottoman Empire and its successor, the Republic of Turkey, for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Kurds, who were loyal allies of the Ottoman Empire during times of conflict with Armenians, began clashing with the Turks once other common enemies were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. There is a deep-seated "genetic memory" within the cadres governing Türkiye that these groups cannot be on good terms with the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

#### Impact on National Development
While this perspective might be understandable from the traditional viewpoint of the Turkish state, it is not a sustainable or valid policy in today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This "extraordinarily backward policy," reflecting a mentality from centuries ago, seriously diminishes the quality of life for all peoples in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. Excluding a large part of the population as "enemies of the state" necessitates restricting fundamental rights, ruling with force, staging coups every 10-20 years, or declaring a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. This policy lowers the overall level of civilization in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. While the fear driving this policy may be understandable, the solution is not to retreat but to address the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.

#### Kurdish Population Dynamics and Influence
The speaker observes that [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Kurds]] are strongly adapting to social life across Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. Considering population trends, it's projected that Kurds will likely dominate Türkiye in 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. They are increasingly penetrating all areas of politics and economy, while their population continues to increase rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. In contrast, the Turkish population is decreasing, with a birth rate below 2, and there is a weakening of national identity among Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>.

### Political Parties and their Future

#### CHP's Structural Weakness
The Republican People's Party (CHP) is perceived to have a serious structural weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. After repeated defeats, reasonable voices suggesting Kılıçdaroğlu's resignation and a complete review of the party have been expelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. The speaker had written an academic paper 41 years prior, arguing for the liquidation of the CHP, which did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:51:20]</a>.

#### Emergence of a New Right Party
The ruling AKP (Justice and Development Party) is seen as having become a "personal corruption organ" that is unsustainable and will likely leave the stage with Tayyip Erdoğan, whether in 5 or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. The question then becomes who will inherit the mantle of the dominant party in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Ms. Meral Akşener is seen as having taken on or wanting this role of a "big right party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. Logic suggests that some cadres within a repeatedly defeated CHP might leave and join this new formation for promised positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

#### HDP's Role in Coalitions
Selahattin Demirtaş's open letter to Meral Akşener is described as "beautiful," noting Demirtaş's ability to express himself well, maintain a humane and civilized line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>. Regarding HDP's potential role in a future government, if the opposition wins and a strengthened parliamentary regime is formed, a coalition government will need to gain a vote of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>. The speaker dismisses current statements about not sitting with HDP as "empty talk" because if a majority depends on them, "you will sit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>. HDP's attitude of constantly seeking the upper hand and refusing to be a "second-class party" would necessitate demanding key ministries like the Ministry of Interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>.

### Turkey-Greece Relations: Supra-Party Policies
The issue of the Islands and sea border in [[middle_east_politics_and_turkeys_role | Turkey-Greece relations]] is a "supra-party policy" for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. There is no conflict between the CHP and AKP on this matter, indicating a consistent national approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. If a government change occurs (a weak possibility), the West would likely "embrace" Türkiye with a "carrot and stick" approach, scrutinizing its issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. The question then would be whether a new opposition government could or would resist this pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

## Observations on Ideology and Society

### Conservatism vs. Revolution
When "winds of thought" shift and norms change, people face two options: become conservative and potentially be overthrown, or become revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. There is no universal formula for success; historically, societies often divide into conservatives and radicals who struggle until one side, or neither, prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

### The Paradox of Arrogance and Moral Superiority
The speaker delves into the paradox of seeking to move away from arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. When some individuals or groups distance themselves from arrogance, the arrogance of others may increase, suggesting that the "total arrogance level" in a society never decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

Those who claim moral superiority, often based on religious or ideological rules, can become arrogant themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. When their message is accepted, their arrogance can intensify, leading to them imposing their "moral superiority as a verse of social oppression and tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. This is described as the unchanging route of all known ideological and belief movements, including Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. Achieving humility is therefore not a simple task with easy formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

### Commercial Enterprises and Political Expression
Legally, it is appropriate for commercial business owners to express their political opinions openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. However, from a business logic perspective, it can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. While small businesses can share common feelings, larger enterprises find it difficult to maintain unity when managers express strong political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. Therefore, business managers should be cautious in expressing political opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

### Language and Identity: Diglossia
The notion that the majority of the Muslim population in Anatolia in the 13th century spoke Persian as their mother tongue is dismissed as a "modern age illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. The speaker argues that many people globally, and historically, are bilingual, using different languages for different contexts (e.g., a home language vs. a market/official language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>. This phenomenon, called diglossia, means that one language might be the "upper language" of state, trade, poetry, and writing (like Persian in 13th-century Anatolia), while another is the "lower language" of home and informal relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>.

A "political revolution" around 1305-1320 saw a sudden shift where Turkish emerged as a cultural language across a wide geography, with Persian classics translated and Turkish texts, especially on Sufism, appearing in incredible amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>. This period, where Turkish suddenly became a cultural language after 250 years of Persian dominance, represents a significant, yet understudied, political event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>.

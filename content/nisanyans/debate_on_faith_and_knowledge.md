From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

A proposed meeting to discuss [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion | reason and religion]] encountered strong negative reactions from two opposing directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One perspective questioned the relevance of reason and language to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The other, characteristic of Enlightenment [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | philosophy]], argued that claiming reason is independent of religion turns reason itself into an object of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Persistence of Religious Belief

Despite scientific advancements, the number of religious people in the world is not decreasing, posing a phenomenon that intelligent individuals must confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. People continue to believe in religion even when not believing is a real social option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, in the Soviet Union, despite 80 years of compulsory anti-religious propaganda in schools, many concluded that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. An anecdotal example is a highly intelligent Polish filmmaker who remained a devout Catholic, stating that in a country like Poland, he couldn't "stand on [his] feet without being Catholic" amidst the meaninglessness and oppressiveness of public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Understanding Rational Thought

Rational thought is defined by a specific way of facing the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Humanity copes with the bombardment of data by proposing and testing hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This method, from simple observations to complex issues, involves:
1.  **Formulating Hypotheses:** Proposing explanations for phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
2.  **Testing Assumptions:** Confronting these hypotheses with results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
3.  **Refinement and Falsification:** If a contrary result is found, theories are re-evaluated, completed, or ultimately deemed wrong, leading to the search for more correct theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

This approach, based on falsifiable assumptions, is the way of learning and the way of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Science's core feature is its method, where all propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. A scientific thesis explains phenomena, and if no strong arguments or examples to the contrary are found, it is accepted until a "brighter and more original view" emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

## The Evolution of Religion and the Nature of Faith

Religion, in its early stages, seems to have been a part of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These early religious explanations, like attributing being lost in a forest to jinns or Troy's defeat to divine intervention, functioned as falsifiable scientific hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Even the Torah's creation narrative can be seen as an early scientific effort attempting to explain the world's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Judaism is presented as a turning point, where God directly intervenes in history and human lives, making questioning God and His stories politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This leads to the emergence of an increasingly abstract God, "loaded with incomprehensible features," that cannot be falsified with any evidence in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. For any question or contradiction, a theological answer is provided, leading to an unfalsifiable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

The concept of faith moves away from scientific verification. Thomas's doubt of Jesus's resurrection, where he demands to touch the wounds, is contrasted with Jesus's response that belief without seeing is more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. The argument is made that true belief, especially in Christianity, requires believing in something that has "no rational possibility" of being proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. The definition of faith becomes an "illogical formulation," based on unprovable things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

When faced with rational arguments against religious doctrines, the final answer often becomes: "Because I believe this. I am not obliged to question this. I cannot question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. This indicates that [[faith_and_rationality | faith and reason]] often cannot meet on common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## The "Escape from Freedom" and Religious Authority

Religion can meet a human need for "escape from freedom," as freedom can be tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. In older religions, answers were often attributed to "our ancestors," which provided a "more humane basis" but was still a falsifiable language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. However, when these ancestral explanations became insufficient, the source of truth shifted to an "inhuman, non-human" authority, a higher, infallible source that bridges the gap between science and certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. This requires surrendering one's freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

## Challenging Positivism

Some claim that science has become a series of dogmas, turning into a "worldly claim" where knowledge is monopolized by scientists, and religion is deemed a "system of ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This is seen as a logical and terminology error, equating Enlightenment with positivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Positivism assumes that as knowledge increases, ignorance decreases, eventually leading to all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

However, the speaker argues that the more a person's knowledge increases, the more their ignorance also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. Learning reveals the "terrifying pit" of ignorance, demonstrating the infinity of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. This perspective highlights that true "blind and deaf" believers, who require no counter-evidence or arguments, are likely few, as religious institutions constantly develop mechanisms to renew and strengthen faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

## Engaging with Religion from a Rational Perspective

The goal is to seriously explain the phenomenon of religion, understand why and how it is a persistent reality, and answer the questions it poses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Ignoring or belittling religion is not an option for those representing rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Instead, they must understand, embrace, and confront it, engaging with its boundaries and size on a rational basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

The speaker proposes establishing an institution that brings a rational approach to religion, distinct from vocational theology faculties which serve as propagandists for Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This initiative aims to define the boundaries of [[faith_and_rationality | faith and rationality]], attract religiosity within rationality, or confine it to a "ghetto" within rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Instead of trying to destroy a believer's religiosity, which the speaker feels hesitant to do without an alternative belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, the main purpose is to reinforce non-religious people and those undecided about faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This approach aims to equip them with answers against traditional religious monopolies on knowledge, rather than the common Turkish approaches of dismissing religious people as "not worth talking about" or crushing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Examples and Future Directions

The speaker suggests engaging with [[historical_narratives_and_philosophical_discussions_on_religious_events | historical narratives and philosophical discussions on religious events]], such as the birth of Islam, through a rational, historical, and ideological lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This involves taking religious hypotheses seriously and attempting to falsify them, a method deemed more enjoyable and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

An example discussed is the Quran's mention of Mary, sister of Aaron and daughter of Imran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. A rational analysis suggests the Quran's author might have confused Mary, mother of Jesus, with Miriam (Mary), sister of Moses and Aaron, daughter of Amram (Imran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. While alternative explanations (e.g., another Imran or Harun) are hypotheses, the primary conclusion for a "sane person" looking objectively at the data points to the author mixing up the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This demonstrates how a rational approach can "surround religion with reason" and make reason the "referee" in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

Future discussions would involve exploring the origins of holy books (Torah, Bible, Quran) through philological analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, the position of religion within Human Rights Law, limits of freedom of expression in religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>, and the current religious situation in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

The topic of [[bribery_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | state and mafia relations]] in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is explored through a direct question from a viewer, which posits that the country's state mechanism operates through the economic interests of mafias [01:48:48]. The speaker elaborates on this concept, asserting that the intertwining of state and mafia is a global phenomenon.

### Global Interconnections
The speaker states that the idea of a "free market" no longer exists anywhere in the world [01:54:48]. Instead, the [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | state bureaucracy]], particularly intelligence agencies, have amassed unprecedented economic and political power across the globe, including the United States, Europe, former Soviet countries, India, Serbia, Greece, and Armenia [01:16:10].

In this environment, capitalists can only gain control or expand through close ties with the state, dependent on its permission and lack of prosecution [01:16:44]. The seemingly "private capital" and the "power explosion" of bureaucracies and the state are "completely intertwined," acting as "two sides of the same coin" [01:17:10].

### The Police State and Oligarchy
A dominant group of "fantastically powerful, rich and largely disconnected from society" tyrants can only maintain their control through the police [01:17:58]. An oligarchy, having retreated into its own domain and become superior to society, relies on an "extremely violent, extremely armed and extremely ruthless police force" [01:18:14]. Consequently, the phenomena of the Police State, the Mafia State, and the Bureaucracy State are considered "the same thing" [01:18:36].

A "police state" is characterized by a constant feeling of the "threat of sincerity and the presence of the police" in everyday life, a situation that is not unique to [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey]] but is also prevalent in Western countries [01:19:03]. While police are necessary for security, in an ideal society, they should be "never seen" by normal citizens [01:19:48].

The speaker emphasizes that a "humane contact" with the police is impossible due to the inherently asymmetrical power dynamic, where officers have the power to end a person's life, arrest, or shoot them [01:20:20]. Police murders and unpunished killings have reached "incomprehensible levels," especially in countries like the United States [01:20:57]. The speaker believes that an over-reliance on police power, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, led to an "absurd point" where basic freedoms were curtailed under the guise of an epidemic [02:22:01].

This course of action, which involves instilling hostility within society and eroding basic rights and social morality, can easily lead to massacres for ideological reasons, much like historical events [02:32:22].

### Lack of Awareness in Turkey
People in [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey]] are often unaware of the global nature of these issues, largely due to limited information from outside the country and low foreign language proficiency [02:40:00]. They mistakenly believe that [[political_changes_in_turkey | Turkey]]'s "shitty situation" is unique or the "end of the world," whereas the situation is worsening globally, including in purportedly democratic countries [02:42:19].

### Societal Passivity and the Absence of Alternatives
A viewer questioned the passivity and "cowardice" of societies in the face of such pressure, noting the lack of public resistance seen in past movements [02:49:56]. The speaker attributes this passivity to several factors:
*   The overwhelming power of the police to suppress demonstrations [02:26:40].
*   The absence of inspiring political alternatives or leaders (like a "Robespierre" or "Lenin") that could rally people, leading to a sense of a "ridiculous stage" in [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | political party]] struggles [02:27:11].
*   The distraction provided by social media, where people engage in "virtual fights" and "shouting virtual slogans," without real-world political impact [02:28:05].

The speaker concludes that while the current situation cannot continue indefinitely, significant change is unlikely in the near future [02:53:53].

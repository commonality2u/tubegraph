From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

This article presents an analysis of select terms within the Quran, aiming to understand them more clearly, powerfully, and convincingly by looking beyond a purely Islamic framework of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The approach involves exploring linguistic and historical evidence to shed light on phrases, expressions, and narratives in the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Story of the Seven Sleepers and "Rakim"

The Quran's Surah Kahf (Chapter 18) narrates the story of seven young believers who were oppressed and sought refuge in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. After sleeping for hundreds of years, they awoke, unaware of the time passed, and sent one of their number to the market. When he produced an old coin, people were amazed, revealing their long slumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This story is considered an allegory of the Apocalypse in Islamic belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The Quranic narrative describes the number of sleepers ambiguously, stating "some say 3 people, some say 5 people, some say 7 people. None of them know anything. Don't ask them. It starts with O Muhammad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Similarly, the duration of their sleep is given as "300 years, but there are also those who say 309 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This creates an impression that the author of the Quran or Allah does not possess sufficient knowledge on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Ambiguity of "Rakim"

The term "Rakim" appears in Surah Kahf alongside "Kahf" (cave): "Or do you think that our verses or miracles are the example of the owners of the cave and the rakim?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. While "Kahf" means "cave," "Rakim" is described as a "completely esr word" with no clear meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Traditional dictionaries and commentators provide diverse interpretations for "Rakim":
*   Firuzabadi's dictionary offers a long paragraph of various interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Ibn Abbas, considered the father of commentators, suggested "Rakim" could be the name of a valley next to Aile, the name of a city, or the name of the mountain where the cave is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Mujahid's commentary suggests "Rakim" is the name of their building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Dahak's commentary states "Rakim" is the name of the cave itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Said Bin Jubayr interpreted "Rakim" as the name of the tablets on which the men's story was written, placed at the cave's entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Turkish translations also reflect this ambiguity:
*   Elmalılı Tafsir interprets "Rakim" as "the stone inscription on which the names of the Companions of the Cave and the Rakim were written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   The old interpretation by the Directorate of Religious Affairs translates "Rakim" as "the Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   Ahmet Tekin's interpretation suggests "Rakim" refers to "the monuments erected on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Yaşar Nuri Öztürk translates it as "Inscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

These varied interpretations highlight the word's inherent ambiguity in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Historical and Linguistic Analysis of "Rakim"

The story of the Seven Sleepers has older roots, with the oldest known version told by Jacob of Sarugh (451-521 AD), a Syriac Monophysite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This story, widely known in Byzantium and among Syriacs, specifically places the event in Ephesus during Emperor Decius's reign (around 250 AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In these older versions, there is no mention of a dog (Kıtmir), which only appears in Islamic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

A key insight into "Rakim" comes from comparing the Syriac script. The name "Decius" (Latin: Decius, Greek: Δέκιος, Syriac: ܕܩܝܘܣ) when written in Syriac (Estrangelo script) can be easily misread as "Rakim" if the letters are slightly poorly formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The Syriac letters for 'D' and 'R' are very similar, as are the final 'S' and 'M' (Mim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. In older Syriac scripts, dots used to differentiate similar letters were absent, further contributing to potential misreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts | Aramaic and Syriac influences]] suggest that the ambiguous word "Rakim" in the Quran is a misspelling of "Decius" (the Roman Emperor), likely due to a misreading of a Syriac text. This implies a textual error originating from the transcription or oral transmission of a pre-existing story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

This [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran | textual analysis of the Quran]] proposes that someone familiar with the story of the Seven Sleepers in Syriac (perhaps an Aramaic-speaking individual) might have narrated it to Muhammad, who then mistakenly incorporated "Rakim" into the Quranic text instead of "Decius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This challenges the traditional Islamic view of the Quran's compilation, suggesting [[controversies_and_fallacies_around_the_qurans_compilation | non-revelatory influences]] on its text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## The Term "Hurin" (Houris)

The word "Hurin" or "Hur" appears in the Quran, often used to describe beings in Paradise. For instance, Surah Dukhan 54 states, "We married them to Hurin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, and Surah Tur 22-23 likewise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This word, however, has no clear Arabic meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### Traditional Interpretations and Hadith Descriptions

Arabic linguists often accept "Hur" as feminine and plural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Its root (Ha-Waw-Ra) can imply "white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Interpreters have struggled with the meaning, often associating it with "eye," leading to phrases like "white-eyed" or "big-eyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. The 15th-century Arabic dictionary *Kamus* defines "Hur" as having eyes with "very white and very black white, like in gazelles and cows," implying a strong contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.

> [!INFO] Turkish translations reflect this interpretive struggle, using terms like "gazelle-eyed houris," "big-eyed houris," "black-eyed houris," "beautiful wives," "clear-sighted spouses," or "snow-white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

Hadiths provide further, often detailed and seemingly absurd, descriptions of houris:
*   Their leg bone marrow can be seen through their skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   They do not pee, defecate, spit, or have runny noses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   Their combs are made of gold, and their sweat smells like musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   They are all identical, lacking genetic diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   Their height is 60 cubits (about 40 meters), like Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
*   Their faces are white and bright like the full moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   Everyone in heaven will have two wives, with transparent white bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   They have snow-white skin and bones that shine like pearls and rubies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   They do not have menstrual periods and do not bear children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

These elaborate descriptions arise from the need to clarify an otherwise unclear Quranic term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Linguistic and Zoroastrian Connection

The word "Hur" may have an external origin. [[historical_origins_and_development_of_certain_words_in_Turkish | Aramaic and Syriac influences on Quranic texts]] are evident here. The Pahlavi text *Ardavīrāz Nāmag* (5th century AD, written in Iran under Sassanid rule), a Zoroastrian spiritual journey, describes a virtuous person's soul appearing as a beautiful woman with "magnificent breasts that please the eye and soothe the soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. This woman replies, "I am the beauty of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

Crucially, the Persian word for "beautiful-faced woman" is *huru* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. The prefix *hu* means "beautiful" (like Greek *eu* in euthanasia), and *ru* means "face" or "soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. Thus, *huru* means "beautiful-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. This concept, where one's spiritual virtues manifest as a beautiful being in the afterlife, aligns with the Zoroastrian tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Zoroastrian Avestan language, older than Pahlavi, uses *hura* for "beautiful-faced," a term frequently used for virtuous people and God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This suggests a common, concrete meaning in pre-Islamic Iranian texts.

The speaker argues that "Hurin" in the Quran is likely a phonetically borrowed word from this Zoroastrian concept, and its original meaning was "beautiful-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. The struggle to interpret "Hurin" in Arabic, leading to convoluted descriptions in hadiths, arises because the word was not native to Arabic and its original context was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## The Concept of "Gehenna" (Hell)

The term "Gehenna" (Arabic: Jahannam, Hebrew: Gehinnom) referring to hell, also demonstrates a semantic evolution rooted in a concrete geographical location.

### Biblical Origins: Hinnom Valley

The "Valley of Hinnom" (Gehinnom) is a geographical valley located next to Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. In the Torah, it is mentioned 11 times, sometimes as "Hinnom" or "Valley of the son of Hinnom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. While some mentions are purely geographical, others refer to a specific event: idolaters building an altar there (a "Tophet") and passing their children through fire as a dedication to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. While later interpreted as child sacrifice, the original texts suggest a purification ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

King Josiah later destroyed this idolatrous altar in the Hinnom Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. After this, the valley became associated with disaster and negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. The Prophet Jeremiah's book, written after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, prophesies that the bodies of cursed Jewish people would be thrown into the Hinnom Valley, where they would be eaten by wolves and birds, causing the valley to be called the "Valley of Tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The interpretation of "passing through fire" in the Old Testament texts (Kings and Chronicles) evolved. Jeremiah intensified the polemic by using the expression "burning in fire," contributing to the later association of the valley with literal burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

### Evolution of Meaning in Jewish Tradition (Talmud)

The meaning of the Hinnom Valley began to shift in Jewish tradition. The Talmud, a compilation of commentaries on the Torah, gradually transformed Gehinnom from a physical valley into a symbolic place of cosmic crime, sin, and punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Mount Zion, representing heaven and salvation, stood in symbolic contrast to Hinnom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

By the 2nd century AD, the idea of fire in the Hinnom Valley was frequently encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. The Babylonian Talmud, specifically Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai (d. ~90 AD), describes two palm trees in the Hinnom Valley with smoke rising between them, declaring it the "gate of hell where sinners will go after death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. This marked a significant shift from a mere place of punishment on Earth to a place of post-mortem torment.

### New Testament (Jesus' Teachings)

In the New Testament, Jesus uses "Gehenna" (Greek transliteration of Gehinnom) 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Here, there is no longer a geographical reference; it consistently refers to the disposal of a sinful body or organ, symbolizing severe punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Only Luke's Gospel suggests that not just the body but also the soul can be thrown into Gehenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. Mark mentions "the never-ending fire of Gehenna," which is interpreted as evidence of an eternal place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

### From Concrete Valley to Abstract Hell

The evolution of "Gehenna" from a physical valley to a concept of eternal hell demonstrates a process of abstraction:
1.  **Physical Valley:** Initially, Gehinnom was a real place outside Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
2.  **Place of Punishment (Earthly):** It became associated with God's punishment for sins during life, like the disposal of corpses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
3.  **Gate to Afterlife Punishment:** In early Jewish tradition, it began to be seen as a portal to a post-mortem place of punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
4.  **Eternal Realm of Torment:** By the time of the New Testament and later Talmudic discussions, it became a distinct, often eternal, realm of punishment for the soul after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

This [[evolution_of_quranic_texts_across_different_regions | evolution of Quranic texts across different regions]] illustrates how religious concepts, including those related to the afterlife, developed over centuries in response to theological questions and external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

### Debate on Eternity of Hell in Jewish and Islamic Belief

In Jewish tradition, there was a debate on whether Hell is eternal. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai's interpretation implied that sinners could reach guidance (Zion) by passing through the pains of Hell, suggesting it's not eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. However, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish argued that for some unrepentant sinners, Hell *is* an eternal torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This gradual shift towards eternity, at least for some, is consistent with how the concept of hell developed in various [[religious_texts_and_interpretations | religious texts and interpretations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

Similarly, in Islamic belief, the concept aligns: Muslims may remain in Hell until they pay for their sins, but infidels remain eternally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. This logical progression to eternal punishment arises from the need for justice for sins not punished in this world, and the idea that some stubborn individuals might never learn from finite punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. This rational thought process, seeking a complete and satisfying solution to theological problems, can transform into an "unfalsifiable dogma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.

## Conclusion

The analysis of terms like "Rakim," "Hurin," and "Gehenna" demonstrates that some ambiguous terms in the Quran may be better understood by examining their linguistic origins and the historical development of concepts in surrounding cultures, particularly those with strong [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts | Aramaic and Syriac influences on Quranic texts]] and Persian traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. This highlights the importance of non-Islamic perspectives in critically understanding [[textual_analysis_of_the_quran | textual analysis of the Quran]] and its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Traditional Islamic interpretations, while rational within their paradigm, may be constrained by their underlying assumptions, preventing them from reaching alternative historical and linguistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>.

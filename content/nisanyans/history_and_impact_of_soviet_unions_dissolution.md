From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The dissolution of the [[gorbachev_and_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] between 1989 and 1991 was a profoundly significant event, characterized by its almost entirely peaceful nature and lack of bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This period saw the liquidation of the "[[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian Empire]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, first with the departure of its European satellite states, most notably leading to the unification of East and West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Subsequently, the [[gorbachev_and_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] itself, comprised of 15 republics, was dissolved surprisingly quickly and peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This event is considered unprecedented in history, as a great world empire surrendered without fighting and withdrew its armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Hopes for Integration with the West

In the early 1990s, [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian society]] held a "big dream" and "big expectation" of being accepted and embraced by the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Russians hoped for assistance in establishing democratic institutions and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The prevailing sentiment was that [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] was a natural part of European civilization and culture, aiming for a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. They recognized their country as the origin of figures like Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, acknowledging a difficult past with a "bad administration" that made them an "enemy to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The hope was to open a new chapter after the [[gorbachev_and_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]], despite its initial idealism and successes, had made mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

This period, from 1991 to 1995, was a "big honeymoon" where Western countries, including [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]], desired to join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, it soon became clear that NATO would not be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Western Exploitation and Russian Response

Contrary to expectations, the "goose foot did not come out like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The Western world, particularly Americans and Germans, "swooped down on [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] with an army of looters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Adventurers, opportunists, swindlers, and scammers exploited [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia's]] natural resources, industrial facilities, art collections, treasures, and even women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Some individuals from the old Communist Party regime also participated in this looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, allowing [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian society]] to witness "the ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Towards 1998, [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian society]], acting as a natural reflex, began efforts to prevent this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This meant resisting the plunder, which often involved using violence when "looting armies" were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This violence manifested through individuals termed "Russian oligarchs" or "Russian mafias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, who used physical force and even bullets to liquidate the looting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This response was met with violent reactions in the Western world, which criticized [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] as "not a democratic country" where "law is not valid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Western Policy Towards Russia Post-Soviet Union

A significant shift in American policy towards [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] occurred after 1995-1996, during the Clinton administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. A political and bureaucratic movement emerged in Washington, advocating for [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] as an enemy and shaping NATO and American foreign policy accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This group, described as driven by "prejudice and arrogance" and "sick of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, largely dominated American foreign policy from 2000 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

The purpose of NATO, established in 1949, was to combat the [[gorbachev_and_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] and limit its potential hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Logically, NATO should have had no reason to exist after the dissolution of the [[gorbachev_and_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. However, NATO, being a large bureaucratic organization feeding a tremendous staff and industries (arms, propaganda, research), decided to maintain its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Its enemy definition was slowly shifted, and from 1997, NATO began to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## NATO Expansion and the Road to Conflict

The first expansion involved the unification of Germany, which brought East Germany into NATO due to West Germany's existing membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] consented to this, having "no other solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

Subsequent expansions included:
*   **Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary** joining NATO (1995 or 1997) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Promises were made that these countries would join the European Union but not NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Three Baltic Republics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia)** joining NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. These republics, formed in 1918 by Germany as a "spear directly directed at the heart of [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, were strategically positioned to plug [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia's]] access to the Baltic Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Bulgaria and Romania** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Division of [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]]** and the addition of its parts to NATO one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

Since 2008, the inclusion of [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] in NATO became a central issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. When the [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukrainian administration]] resisted this, a coup in 2014, supported by Western forces, led to a change in administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This resulted in a "bloody conflict" in 2014, with tens of thousands killed in regions like Donetsk and Lugansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The Western world continually pushed for [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] to join NATO, sending fleets to the Black Sea and declaring an anti-[[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### Russia's Stance on Ukraine

[[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia's]] position since the early 2000s, and especially since 2008, has been clear: [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] cannot be included in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] is considered a "part of our historical homeland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, with a significant Russian population and integrated economic, communication, and cultural ties to [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] declared it would not hand [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] over to a military power that considers [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Warnings Ignored

Prominent figures, including George Kennan, known as the theorist of the first Cold War, warned against this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. In 1997, Kennan stated that NATO expansion towards [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] was "suicide," "madness," and "stupidity" that would inevitably lead to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Many other "sane people" in military, diplomatic, and academic fields also warned that this policy was "madness and will lead to war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

[!ATTENTION|Responsibility for the War]
From a historical perspective, the side that "planned this war," "knowingly and willingly" caused it, is seen as primarily responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The argument is that constant threats and aggressive posturing can corner a nation, forcing it to defend itself, often with "ugly methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Current Conflict Context

The ongoing conflict in [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] is not viewed as a conflict *between* [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] and [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]], but rather "between [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] and the Western alliance, namely NATO led by the United States and its satellites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Western public opinion, particularly in Turkey, is seen as repeating "propaganda headlines of one side with a fierce determination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This propaganda asserts that Putin must have gone crazy, that he invaded an independent country, and that the bombing is inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, the speaker questions the premise that the borders of independent states are "inviolable," suggesting a lack of critical thought in accepting the discourse of a military alliance seen as a "pioneer and leader and the main actor of all kinds of meanness and dishonesty in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

> "If [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] becomes a weapon against [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] and [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] is crushed, will be their interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
> "NATO you call a gangster army... come here, settle on the edge of [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] they say they will understand the consequences of this education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

The speaker highlights historical instances where the Western world has bombed independent countries:
*   **Serbia (1998)**: Bombed for weeks and months to make Kosovo an independent country run by "drug trafficking gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Iraq (2002)**: Destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan**: Invaded and destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Syria, Yemen, Libya**: Destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

The perspective is that fighting to prevent a "gang of bandits" from taking over [[cultural_analysis_of_ukraine_and_the_impact_of_russian_influence | Ukraine]] is an "honorable act" that should be applauded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### Potential Outcomes

The [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukraine War]] might be a "pyrrhic victory" for [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]], meaning a victory with such heavy damages that it might feel undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The West's objective appears to be to bring down the current [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian administration]], even at the cost of destroying [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This approach is based on underestimating the enemy, a common mistake at the start of wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

Historical examples of underestimating [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] leading to "great disappointment" include:
*   Napoleon in 1812 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   The Ottoman Empire in 1877 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   Hitler in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the war is a "gamble" and a "loss shot" with an unpredictable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

### The Role of Propaganda and Information

In the current conflict, the military powers of the sides are a "separate issue" compared to their propaganda capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. The West is unrivaled in its "scope of lies" and uses "highest quality scriptwriters who write Hollywood scripts" for propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. An example cited is the widely circulated story of Ukrainian soldiers telling a [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian]] warship to "go [__]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>, which was entirely fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>.

The speaker notes that the war has not been as bloody as depicted and suggests significant coordination and material problems on the [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russian]] side, indicating they were "not very prepared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

## Underlying Contradiction

The fundamental contradiction between the West and [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] is that [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] (along with China) represents one of the few remaining geographies where Western capitalism and companies "cannot freely play their horses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. Western capitalism desires to "freely commodify" these countries' industrial resources, human capital, and existing values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. The resistance from [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] and China, with their strong military forces, is that they also have capitalists who demand a share in their own states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. If India were to join this alliance, the West's task would become even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>.

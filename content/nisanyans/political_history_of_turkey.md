This article explores aspects of the [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | political dynamics]] and [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | social issues in Türkiye]], drawing on an analysis of its past leaders and the evolution of its state ideology. The discussion covers the foundational principles of the Turkish Republic, the challenges of modernization, and the ongoing debates surrounding national identity and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Re-establishing State Power and Protecting Leadership

A fundamental assumption for leaders like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Abdülhamid II was the need to re-establish the power of a collapsed state and protect their own power and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This principle guides subsequent actions in a logical sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

To achieve modernization, a strong move was necessary after the Ottoman Empire's century-long struggle and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This included creating national excitement, even if "fake," in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While elites in Istanbul and Izmir were perceived as lukewarm, ordinary citizens were inspired by stories of homeland, nation, and victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

A tradition of intrigue remained from the Union and Progress era, with political terror not to be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Measures were taken to stop the state's disintegration, including deterrent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In a world where global powers like England and Germany were vying for dominance, a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism was sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The opportunity presented by France's struggles led to the acquisition of a piece of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The speaker notes that protecting oneself from the corrupting effect of absolute power is difficult, and those who claim otherwise are "lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The conditions facing Sultan Abdülhamid II involved a "completely exhausted state" that needed to maintain its power and protect his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Criticizing such leaders from a distance is easy, but following the chain of events reveals how difficult, perhaps impossible, it is to escape the "frame fate has drawn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Critique of Kemalism and its Disciples

The speaker suggests that Mustafa Kemal's share in making arrogance and insult the main axis of [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkish political language]] is undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The "Kemalist sect" is described as rejecting Islam and attempting to water itself down as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This sect's "Hakime arrogance" (arrogance of governance/ruling) is seen as the basis of a social theory that asserts "we are right" and "the other is sharpened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

This "Hakime arrogance" prevents them from understanding the rights of the Turks and establishing emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It also leads to ignorance regarding crucial issues like the Kurdish Parliament, and makes it impossible for them to understand [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | Türkiye's modern history]] or speak sensibly on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

The speaker states that it is necessary to challenge the sacred atmosphere around Mustafa Kemal, showing him as an "ordinary political leader" whose actions can be discussed based on reason and benefit, rather than an "epic hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The book *Wrong Republic* is mentioned as an example of questioning assumptions rather than disparaging actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

A "new and democratic Kemalism" is considered a "complete dream" by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. This is because young secular academics, who might espouse such an idea, are seen as marginalized, out of touch with the country, and deeply hateful of the majority population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The idea of a "totalitarian dictator of the 1930s becoming a more democratic symbol is an absurd idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### The Savarona Yacht Incident

The purchase of the Savarona yacht for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is described as one of the "most despicable and most pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. The speaker describes it as a chain of fraud, driven by a "boss's megalomania" where individuals "robbed the mind in a chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. Atatürk used the ship for about a week before his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. İsmet İnönü never used it, and the yacht remained in disrepair for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. Attempts to repurpose it as a training ship or a tourist attraction failed, and it was even allegedly used as a "brothel for upper-class customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

## Mustafa Kemal's Achievements and Limitations

Mustafa Kemal had two clear goals: to save and rebuild a collapsed state and to protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. He was successful in re-establishing the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. His power was seized through a "coup and civil war" after being appointed by the Union and Progress cadres, making loss of power equate to loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This situation is compared to Abdülhamid II and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

However, the radical transformation needed to make the system he established permanent in the long term "could not be provided" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. The project of raising the country to the level of "contemporary, that is, the leading countries of the world was a complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The secular decline experienced by the Ottoman Empire since the 1600s continued into the Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## The Izmir Assassination and Political Purges

The speaker questions whether the Izmir assassination attempt was real or an excuse to intimidate the opposition, stating "We will never know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. It is suggested that "if you search enough, there is definitely an assassination college at every stage of any dictator's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. The incident was evaluated as a "blessing from God" and used to purge "old Iddaa Terakki cadres" (Committee of Union and Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Key figures eliminated or tried included Finance Minister Mr. Cavit, who channeled funds for the National Struggle, and those who organized the Istanbul leg of the struggle like Vasıf Bey and Kara Kemal Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. All seven people who signed the Amasya declaration with Mustafa Kemal, including Kazım Karabekir, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and Rauf Orbay, were tried with the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This purge is likened to similar movements under Stalin in the Soviet Union and Hitler in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The cadres who made the revolution and those who would govern often had different characteristics and engaged in "bloody fights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## The Role of Ideology and the Future of Türkiye

The speaker believes that the process of "adopting Islam as the official state ideology in Türkiye is not a process that can be easily reversed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This is partly due to changing global balances and polarizations, making it increasingly difficult for [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Türkiye]] to remain in the Western camp, rendering it a "meaningless foreign policy choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The modernizing ruling class that has governed for a century has failed to benefit the country or realize its claims, leading to a search for a new route and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The speaker expresses shame at "pumping his policy so recklessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, possibly referring to a policy of unquestioning support for Kemalism. The idea that "governing a state is more of a science than an art" is emphasized, implying objective laws that even radical dreams must obey to avoid being "wiped out with the first punch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The speaker asserts that [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] would not have ceased to exist without Mustafa Kemal, questioning the notion that 13 million people would have been destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. If someone else had been in his place in 1919 or 1923, "the same things would have happened, more or less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, though perhaps not with a leader as "bright and brave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

The speaker believes that [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Ottoman administration]] in its traditional form effectively ended around 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Sultan Abdülhamid's reign "stopped the flow of a stream" for 33 years, leaving almost nothing left in terms of continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. By 1908, the prominent cadres were too young to remember the past and had no respect for institutions like the sultanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Sultan Reşat, who replaced Abdülhamid, was an old man confined to his palace, lacking power and forced to sign death warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire "shattered" after a military defeat suffered by the Union and Progress team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. It ceased to be an empire and became a nation-state, losing a large part of its population, with only a "large part of the Turkish population and a small part of the Kurdish population" remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Continuing with the old cadres or the sultanate was "very difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

In the early 20th century, several ancient dynasties collapsed (Russian Tsardom, Austria-Hungary, German, Iranian), indicating that [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | Türkiye]] was not isolated from global trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The speaker suggests that the experiences between 1907 and 1920 were very effective in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

A "new ideology" and a "more inclusive ideal" are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. The existing ideal has "exhausted" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. The first attempt to replace it was Turgut Özal's globalist-capitalist American model, which did not suit Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. The Westernization project, pursued under the guise of European Union integration until 2011, also faltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

In the absence of alternatives, the speaker concludes that "Islam" has been the "Idea that unites the country, defining the country and shows a target to the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This helplessness and lack of alternatives continue today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>. The entire world, especially the developed Western world, is heading towards an "explosion" due to inadequate existing thought systems, political parties, and institutional structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. People are unhappy with existing alternatives, seeking "hope, a way out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

Historically, [[history_and_nationalism_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] has not had a "popular Islamic fanaticism or a dominant political view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. It has been a state tradition since Byzantium, with a ruling class that chose Western Europe as a reference point starting from the 1820s-1830s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This ruling class adopted French culture, changing art, state, and army structures after Western models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. Türkiye has consistently been "the most open face of the Islamic world to the West at every stage of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>, being the first in the Islamic world to adopt Western innovations like the printing press, telescope, new military organization, and paper money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

Before Mustafa Kemal's period, twenty-five percent of Türkiye's population and over thirty percent of its economic structure were non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. The speaker cautions against underestimating Afghanistan, describing it as a "very unfortunate country" that has suffered heavy blows and been "taken back to the Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

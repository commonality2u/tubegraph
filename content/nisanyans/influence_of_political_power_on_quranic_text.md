The textual integrity and [[history_of_quran_codification | codification of the Quran]] are subjects often obscured by fallacies and half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From a non-traditional perspective, the [[analysis_of_the_quranic_text_from_a_nonislamic_perspective | compilation and standardization of the Quran]] appear significantly influenced by political considerations, particularly during the Umayyad period.

## Compilation and Early Transmission

Contrary to some beliefs, there is no serious data indicating extensive writing of the Quran before 50 to 60 years after the death of Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. At that time, Arabic script was not developed for literary works; it lacked dots and movements, making it suitable only for notes or short scribbles like graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The prevailing written language of the Middle East, used by both Jews and Christians, was Syriac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The idea of writing Arabic, then considered a tribal language, did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Before its [[compilation_of_the_quran_after_muhammad | compilation]], Quranic content was primarily transmitted orally, with people memorizing and reciting passages in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The authenticity of this oral transmission, however, cannot be definitively verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Political Influence on Codification

The narrative that a commission established during the time of Uthman wrote down the Quran is asserted to be a fabrication, created approximately 180 years after the event during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This later narrative emerged to address the discomfort with the fact that the Quran was compiled a significant time after Muhammad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

According to current scientific and objective information, the Quran was compiled around 680 CE during the Umayyad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, approximately 50 to 60 years after Muhammad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This period saw the first [[history_of_quran_codification | codification of the Arabic script]] under Caliph Abd al-Malik, specifically for the purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Standardization and Suppression of Variants

At the time of the Quran's writing, different textual traditions existed across various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. People from different regions would dispute verses, claiming to know them differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These variant traditions were ultimately silenced by order of Hajjaj, and a standardized text was created that aligned with the political interests of the unified Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> A text was created that was in line with the political interests of the common Umayyad State.

This process highlights the significant [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | role of political authority]] in shaping the final, standardized version of the Quranic text. The [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | evolution and interpretation of religious texts]] can thus be seen as intertwined with the political needs and actions of the ruling powers.

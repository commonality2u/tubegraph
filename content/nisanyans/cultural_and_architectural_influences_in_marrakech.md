Marrakech is described as a very colorful, lively, and sympathetic country, with very friendly people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The city's bazaar is considered "the most colorful and beautiful of the oriental bazaars" the speaker has seen, an "incredible endless labyrinth" full of "colorful excitement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. It is both impressive and tiring to navigate due to the incredible crowds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Islamic Civilizational Influence

A key question posed regarding Marrakech's city architecture and culture, and its similarities to places like Samarkand and Bukhara, revolves around how Islamic civilization established its cultural hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The speaker identifies three similar, echoing elements prevalent across a large portion of the old world within the Islamic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>:

1.  **The Market (Bazaar)**: Considered the "indispensable basic institution of Islamic cities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These consist of narrow, labyrinthine streets with numerous small shops, primarily selling handicrafts and industrial products, often organized by professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This structure is observed not only in Marrakech but also in Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Urfa, Mardin, Baghdad, and Iranian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
2.  **Non-Figurative Arts**: A highly developed art style that avoids the depiction of nature and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It is based on the "continuous repetition of abstract figures," forming a sophisticated, decorative, and colorful style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This art is described as "very clearly Islamic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> and is evident in Marrakech's old palaces, madrasahs, and elite houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
3.  **The Mosque**: Serving as the "basic regulator of natural life" and central to the event of prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

These three factors are seen as typical and indispensable elements across a significant portion of the old world under Islamic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Berber and Arab Cultural Dynamics

In the history of Morocco, the native Berbers initially resisted Islamic rule for centuries when the Arabs conquered the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. However, subsequent dynasties and rulers of Morocco, though often of native Berber origin, consistently adopted Arab culture, identity, and the Islamic religion as their "flag" when attempting to establish a state or broader sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This was because Islam and the Arab civilization became the symbol of civilization and a tool for wider acceptance and submission beyond tribal boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. Berber feudal dynasties that rose to power boasted of Arab origin and claimed to be more Muslim than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. This parallel is drawn with Turkey, where Turkishness and Muslimness were similarly used for political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. In Morocco, being Arab was used as a complementary cultural element to being Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

## Ottoman Influence on Morocco

While the [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] had periods of influence in North Africa, its formal administrative structure did not attain the same permanence or sophistication in Morocco as it did in its core territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. Moroccan dynasties were often temporary, and their legitimacy frequently questioned, leading to frequent rebellions and political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

Despite this, there is "great admiration for the Ottoman Empire and Türkiye" across the Arab world, including Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. Turks are seen as "rich relatives" and the "whitest Muslim country," a perception that plays a role despite claims of no racism in the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:21">[01:32:21]</a>.

Specific instances of [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman]] influence in Morocco include:
*   In the 17th century, the Alioğulları dynasty, upon coming to power, imitated the Ottomans, establishing a Janissary-like professional army with Turkish commanders and officers directly connected to the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>.
*   The Turkish title "Pasha" was adopted and used from the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. Even in the 1890s, a Black African prime minister and dictator was known as Ba Ahmet Pasha, and his palace in Marrakech is still called Pasha's Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.
*   The [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottomans]] made significant efforts to establish a foothold in Morocco during the 16th century (1560s-1570s), capturing the city of Fez twice and most of Morocco once, holding it for about six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>. This strategic effort was driven by the Ottoman Empire's desperate search for an Atlantic port after the shift in world trade routes from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. These attempts ultimately ended in failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>.

Overall, while there's a strong admiration for Türkiye and some borrowed cultural elements, the direct [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman]] influence on Moroccan state structure and everyday life was not as profound or lasting compared to other regions.

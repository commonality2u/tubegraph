The use of anonymous accounts on social media platforms is a subject of ongoing debate, particularly concerning proposals for mandatory identity verification. The speaker addresses the question of whether such accounts should be stopped, even if verified with official documents like passport photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## The Debate on Identity Verification

The speaker strongly asserts that enforcing identification requirements (e.g., ID copies, passport photos, fingerprints) for internet access is an unacceptable restriction on freedoms and a form of tyranny, especially in a "bureaucratic nightmare" age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Such strict measures contribute to [[Impact of technology on privacy and state surveillance | impact_of_technology_on_privacy_and_state_surveillance]] concerns and could lead to [[Data privacy and security issues | data_privacy_and_security_issues]] if personal data is widely collected.

However, the current situation where anyone can open an account and misuse it, making it difficult to distinguish between humans and bots, also restricts freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. This highlights the need for a balanced approach.

## Proposed Solutions

A crucial distinction is made between truly anonymous accounts (without real identity) and "bot" accounts. The most significant reform in social media, according to the speaker, should be the elimination of bot accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. These accounts are described as:
*   Randomly and mechanically opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>
*   Insulting without responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>
*   Lying and talking nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>
*   Involved in [[Social media advertisements and their relevance | social_media_advertisements_and_their_relevance]] or not appearing as they seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>

Such accounts should be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

In contrast, the speaker advocates for "anonymous but real accounts," which would involve users not revealing their official name or address but maintaining a consistent personality structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. This approach would allow for freedom of expression without requiring full identity disclosure.

## The Value of Anonymous Accounts

Many of the highest-quality accounts followed by the speaker on [[Social media and political controversies in Trkiye | Twitter]] are from individuals whose identities are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. These accounts often demonstrate consistent and logical discourse over long periods, indicating a "certain human development line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. The speaker suggests that there should be many more such "masked warriors" contributing to online discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

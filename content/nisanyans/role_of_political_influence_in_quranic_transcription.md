The notion that a 1400-year-old Quran is 99.5% similar to modern copies is described as a subject "obscured with so many fallacies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. There is no serious data regarding how much of the Quran was written down, where, or in what script, during the Prophet Muhammad's lifetime or immediately after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Instead, there are "only a series of fallacies, a series of half-truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> regarding its early compilation.

## The State of Early Arabic Script and Other Influences

At the time of Muhammad and for 60 years thereafter, the [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] was not suitable for literary works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It existed primarily as graffiti, comprising only three to five-word scribbles of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This early form lacked dots or movements (vowels), making it a "distorted version" useful only for notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The idea that Arabic, a tribal language, could be a written language did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

During this period, the dominant written language in the Middle East, used by both Jews and Christians, was the [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts | Syriac script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Codification of Arabic Script and Quranic Compilation

The [[creation_and_codification_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] was first codified (invented) around 680 AD during the time of Caliph Abdul Malik, specifically for the purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The Quran itself was written down approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The claim that a commission was established during Muhammad's time and later during the time of Hz. Osman to write down the Quran is a fabrication. This narrative was created roughly 180 years after the events, during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This fabrication emerged because the fact that the Quran was written "a long time after Muhammad" made people uneasy, leading to the narrative that it was written in Osman's time to reduce this discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Scientifically and objectively, the Quran is understood to have been compiled around 680 AD during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Regional Variations and Political Standardization

Before its compilation, the Quran existed as a series of messages that were memorized and recited in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, there is no reliable information about the authenticity of this oral transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

When the stage of writing the Quran began, there were "different traditions" in various cities and regions, such as Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. People in different regions would dispute verses, saying, "We don't know that verse like that, we know it like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

These differing regional traditions were ultimately "silenced by the order of Hajjaj" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A single text was then created, which was "in line with the political interests of the common Umayyad State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This standardization occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

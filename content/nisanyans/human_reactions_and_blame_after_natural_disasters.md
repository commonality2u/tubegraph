After a natural disaster, a common human reaction is to search for a culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This search stems from humanity's difficulty in processing a completely meaningless event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, leading to a need to believe that someone committed a crime for the tragedy to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Historical Precedent
Historically, this blame-seeking reflex has been observed in various eras and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For instance, in the Middle Ages, after earthquakes and plague epidemics, people often blamed Jewish communities, which resulted in massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This desire to hold a group responsible, or to attribute events to sin, is described as a very typical human reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Contemporary Blame in Türkiye
Following the recent earthquake in Türkiye and Syria, this basic human instinct manifested in two main ways, influenced by people's social preferences and educational backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>:

*   **Blaming Syrians** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>: Some accuse Syrians of being "naughty looters" who do not share the feelings of those affected by the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This perspective leads to calls for their destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Blaming Contractors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>: Others attribute the widespread destruction to contractors and the insufficient implementation of zoning laws by public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This is seen as the cause of the earthquake's consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The speaker notes that both reactions stem from the same mentality and mental state, and he sees no significant difference between the two in terms of their reasoning styles or implications for mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The choice of whom to blame often aligns with one's political tendencies, social status, and educational background; for example, those who consider themselves more elite or left-leaning tend to blame contractors, while others blame Syrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Critique of the Blame Game
The speaker argues that pinpointing a single source of blame for the disaster is far more complex than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Blaming builders who operate within limited budgets is not a fair approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Construction inherently involves three main actors: the property owner, the contractor, and the zoning bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. If the vast majority of buildings of a certain type collapse, the responsibility should fall on those who set the rules, not just those who ignore them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The pervasive use of reinforced concrete construction in Türkiye, a country not able to allocate large funds for housing, is cited as a systemic issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The reality is that construction is often undertaken by the middle class aiming to climb the social ladder, not solely by the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Government's Role in Directing Anger
The speaker suggests that the government might be deliberately channeling public anger towards certain targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Recognizing that a disaster inevitably sparks moral rebellion against authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, a government's first priority might be to maintain state authority and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

From a pragmatic, managerial viewpoint, it might be considered "smart policy" to direct the natural instinct for hatred towards a vulnerable group like refugees rather than the construction sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. A wave of hatred towards the construction sector could lead to unpredictable results, potentially destroying a vital part of the national economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. While targeting refugees is a "disaster for humanity," it might be deemed preferable to the economic and political fallout of blaming contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## The Psychological Need for a Culprit
Ultimately, when people face a terrible tragedy, they seek someone to hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. The state's role is not necessarily to create a "decent and healthy living space" but rather to provide a focal point for this anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. The social and legal structures, heavily influenced by the drive for profit, hinder individual or group efforts to create safer or more humane environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. In this system, the only guiding idea for building is investment and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. The speaker argues that this logic leads to a deadlock where the alternatives are either profit-driven capitalists or controlling civil servants, both deemed disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

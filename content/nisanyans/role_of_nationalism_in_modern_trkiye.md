Nationalism in modern Türkiye is described as a complex and often problematic force, frequently serving as a tool for political agendas and having deep roots in the country's history.

## Historical Context and Development

The establishment of modern Türkiye involved efforts to create "national excitement," even if "fake," in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This involved captivating ordinary citizens with stories of homeland, nation, Sakarya, and "infidels who poured into the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. State-sponsored narratives like the theories of language and history emerged as part of this nationalistic drive after 1929-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The process of "nationalization" involved molding the Turkish nation into a new identity synthesis, a difficult task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. This was not unique to Türkiye; major dynasties and states around the world also collapsed or transformed around the same period, suggesting a global trend rather than an isolated Turkish phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Characteristics and Manifestations

Nationalism in Türkiye is portrayed as the "flag of the Feast of [[racism_and_nationalism_in_turkey | contemporary Turkish racism]] and state gatekeeping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It promotes a "moral blindness that a priori justifies all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, encapsulated by the phrase: "If the issue is homeland, the rest is details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Individuals exhibiting this type of nationalism are described as "Türkiye's half-educated" who "spew hatred and complexes against the outside world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Despite this, they struggle to establish "emotional communication with their own common strata inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> and often resort to embracing the state's power for political relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Nationalism as a Tool
Nationalism is seen as a "tool of populism all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, glorifying a people and often associated with demagoguery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It is characterized as a "pathology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> and a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Impact on Governance and Society
The influence of nationalism contributes to an "arrogant and insulted" tone in Turkish political language, a characteristic that is undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This ideology is rooted in a "Hakime arrogance," a "basis of a theory of society" that posits "we are right" and "the other is sharpened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This mindset prevents understanding the rights of Turks or establishing emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, leading to "ignorance that reaches the level of stupidity" on crucial issues like the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It also makes it "completely impossible" for adherents to understand modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

The state bureaucracy in Türkiye, from the smallest office to the highest levels, is described as being "decorated with the symbols of a religious ceremony" where a "holy icon must definitely be at the bedside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This symbolic use of an "icon with a back" allows civil servants to disregard normal human logic and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>, leading to an attitude of "do not talk about beauty in Van, I will crush you like an insect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Relationship with Kemalism and Islamism

Kemalism, often seen as a nationalistic ideology, is described as a "sect" that rejects Islam and tries to position itself as an alternative to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, it is argued that the "deepest and most hadith dimension of historical Islam is the nation of Hakime arrogance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, implying a shared underlying arrogance.

A return to Kemalist culture is considered a "very, very distant possibility" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, partly because the modernizing class, associated with Kemalism, has not ultimately benefited the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The idea of a "new and democratic Kemalism" is dismissed as "completely a dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, with the observation that secular academics who propose it have become marginalized and hate the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

With the exhaustion of previous ideologies like Turgut Özal's globalist economy model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a> and the Westernization project under the guise of the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>, Islam has emerged as an alternative "Idea that unites the country, defining the country and shows a target to the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This helplessness and lack of alternatives continue today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, contributing to a global need for new administrative models as existing thought systems and political parties are "inadequate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. The entire Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, believes the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

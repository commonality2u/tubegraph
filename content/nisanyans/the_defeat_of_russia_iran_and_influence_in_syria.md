A significant event has recently unfolded, marked as a milestone in 21st-century history, signaling a major victory for one side and a substantial defeat for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. This outcome is believed to be the result of a compromise agreement involving Russia, the United States, Türkiye, Iran, and Israel in [[current_political_events_in_syria_and_international_interventions | Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>.

## Russia's Significant Defeat
The recent events constitute a major defeat for [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:27">[02:14:27]</a>. Russia appears to have abandoned its claim as a global player, losing its last military presence in the [[middle_east_geopolitical_shifts | Middle East]] and the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>. Even with potential victories in [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] and Georgia, Russia has accepted its status as a regional power, capable of influence only in areas directly related to its immediate surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:01">[03:46:01]</a>. The only place outside the borders of the former Soviet Union where Russia maintains a military presence is now the Sahel region in Africa, including Mali and Upper Volta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This marks a phase where Russia has lost its ability to be an effective player on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>.

The reliability of Russia as a partner for the Kurds or any other actor has suffered a heavy blow, leading to serious questions regarding its dependability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:17">[03:39:17]</a>. Russia has demonstrated that it lacks the capability to project strong military force far beyond its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:33">[03:39:33]</a>.

## Iran's Great Defeat
[[cultural_transformation_in_the_middle_east_turkey_and_iran | Iran]] has also suffered a great defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:53">[05:20:53]</a>. The Iranian regime's long-standing policy of establishing an influence area in the Middle East, pursued since 2001, has faced a significant setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>. [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]] is considered a key "door" for Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. Iran has substantial influence and power in Iraq, especially Southern Iraq, and has supported armed groups in Lebanon that pose a military threat to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:23">[06:00:23]</a>. However, Iran cannot reach the Mediterranean coast without passing through Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:04">[06:34:04]</a>. By losing this crucial access, Iran's ability to project power beyond its geographical confines has become very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:46">[06:39:46]</a>. This strategic loss may paradoxically lead Iran to seek a *modus vivendi* with the United States and even Israel, potentially opening a path to peace, as the underlying strategic threat that fueled its hostility with the Western alliance has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:08">[06:52:08]</a>. Losing Syria has pushed Iran closer to becoming a small or medium-sized state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:07">[07:31:07]</a>.

## China's Setback
China's ambitious "Belt and Road Initiative," aimed at connecting China to Europe and the Mediterranean basin by road, faces a serious blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>. Two key countries in this chain are Türkiye and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:58">[08:13:58]</a>. With both potentially under NATO or American alliance control, China's grand project could suffer significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:30">[08:20:30]</a>.

## US Strategy and the Winners
The United States is believed to have successfully implemented a strategic project that had been years in the making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:25">[11:34:25]</a>. This strategy achieved its goals without firing a single bullet or losing a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. The plan, starting around October 2022/2023, involved several steps:
*   Turning a blind eye to or even encouraging Hamas's attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:37">[12:37:37]</a>.
*   Eliminating Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:43">[12:54:43]</a>.
*   Neutralizing Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatened Northern Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:09">[13:03:09]</a>.
*   Overthrowing Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:14">[13:06:14]</a>.

The primary winners of this geopolitical shift are the United States and Israel, who have successfully executed a long-prepared regional plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:33">[13:47:33]</a>.

### Türkiye's Role and Gains
[[the_role_of_turkey_in_the_syrian_conflict | Türkiye]] appears to have gained a certain, albeit small, advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:08">[14:12:08]</a>. Although the overall share given to Türkiye in the Syrian incident is small, its controlled militia forces, like the Free Syrian Army, are effective in Azaz and Afrin, and have expanded their boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:20">[15:15:20]</a>. Türkiye's long-term tactical goal of capturing Manbij remains active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:16">[15:59:16]</a>. This positions Türkiye to have a share in the reconstruction of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:12">[16:09:12]</a>.

It is suggested that Türkiye was compelled to adapt to this operation rather than actively initiating it, choosing to participate on the victorious side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:23">[16:38:23]</a>. This was seen as a wise choice, as Türkiye had no other viable option in the face of the American-Israeli alliance's clear victory over the Russia-Iran alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:23">[17:18:23]</a>.

### The Kurds as Beneficiaries
A major beneficiary of these events are the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:01">[18:05:01]</a>. It is now understood that [[current_political_events_in_syria_and_international_interventions | Syria]] will likely form a structure with at least two regions:
1.  A Syrian state centered in Damascus and Aleppo, dominated by HTS and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:19">[18:17:19]</a>.
2.  A largely independent Kurdish region east of the Euphrates, akin to Northern Iraq, which could be a "second Kurdistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:04">[18:33:04]</a>.

The speaker expresses happiness and congratulates their Kurdish friends on this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:35">[19:08:35]</a>. The Kurds are expected to play an important role as one of the two main players in the new Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:12">[19:18:12]</a>. Türkiye will likely have to compromise with and accept this new Kurdish formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:55">[19:37:55]</a>. Symbolic gestures, such as an alleged invitation from Donald Trump to the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces to a coronation ceremony, signify strong American backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:05">[20:06:05]</a>.

## The Syrian People: Potential Losers
Despite the shifts, the Syrian people are seen as the potential losers in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:08">[21:02:08]</a>. While peace could make them winners, this possibility is viewed as weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:06">[21:11:06]</a>. Concerns exist regarding the Alawite population in Western Syria, who may not resist an HTŞ regime, and the rebel forces' lack of activity in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:21">[21:20:21]</a>.

### Historical Parallels and Challenges of State Re-establishment
Past American interventions aimed at overthrowing dictators and bringing democracy have often led to chaos and division, citing examples like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:02">[22:14:02]</a>. The speaker expresses skepticism that Syria will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:04">[23:42:04]</a>.

Re-establishing state authority after a revolution and the collapse of institutions is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. It requires a strong leader who can enforce orders and intimidate, a process historically associated with bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Without such a forceful leader, Syria risks fragmenting into many pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.

## Critiquing Clichés and Propaganda
The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding clichés and propaganda in analyzing geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. Common phrases like "Assad killed his people" are highlighted as propagandistic and linguistically inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:21">[02:52:21]</a>. All states, throughout history, have suppressed rebellions against their authority, regardless of their political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.

The categorization of rebellious forces as "Islamic terrorists" is also critically examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>. The speaker argues that the ideological cover (e.g., Marxist or Islamist) is merely a "decoration" for a fundamental power struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>. The choice of ideology often depends on what is currently an "attractive gathering point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. The core dynamics of political power struggles remain similar across different historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:53">[03:29:53]</a>. Therefore, judging groups based solely on their ideological labels is dismissed as simplistic and "children's thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:21">[03:51:21]</a>. The power struggle in [[the_syrian_conflict_and_its_global_implications | Syria]] must be understood within the larger framework of great power clashes in the [[middle_east_geopolitical_shifts | Middle East]] and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>.

## The Future of Syrian Refugees
In the short term, there might be increased migration from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:43">[03:24:43]</a>. However, there is an intention from Türkiye and Western powers to facilitate the return of some Syrian refugees, particularly those without professional skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:01">[03:35:01]</a>.

The effectiveness of social media advertising is called into question, with one observer noting a complete lack of personal engagement with online ads despite their supposed sophisticated targeting methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Ad Effectiveness
The speaker states that, through personal experience and conversations with others, they have never encountered an advertisement on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube that piqued their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. This phenomenon is described as a "100% 0 guess rate" for ad relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. The general sentiment is that advertising is "always stupid," including traditional television and newspaper ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:48">[02:39:48]</a>.

## The Paradox of Data Collection
Despite claims that platforms like Facebook know users better than they know themselves due to "incredible amounts of data" collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>, and can "predict your next step, your next behavior with algorithmic precision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, this data appears to be useless for effective advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. It is suggested that a chimpanzee randomly sending advertisements would have a higher probability of presenting something interesting than the current artificial intelligence (AI) systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The speaker concludes that the intelligence level of AI in this context is "lower than the average chimpanzee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:38">[03:47:38]</a>.

Advertisers continue to spend billions of dollars to collect this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:33">[03:57:33]</a>, and despite the lack of results, they persist, operating under the impression that "Since everyone is doing it, we should do it too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:39">[04:51:39]</a>.

## The Real Purpose of Data?
A significant theory proposed is that advertising is merely the "front side" of a larger operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:47">[04:09:47]</a>. The actual collectors of information are believed to be the "police and intelligence forces of the states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:10">[04:16:10]</a>. This perspective aligns with broader discussions on the [[role_of_media_and_social_commentary | role of media and social commentary]] in modern society.

The motivation for state entities differs from advertisers: their incomes are tax-funded, meaning the usefulness of the collected information "does not concern them" as long as they appear to be active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>. This highlights a potential area of [[conspiracy_theories_and_public_trust_in_information | public trust in information]] and state motives.

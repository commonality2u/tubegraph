The 1930s in [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkey]] are identified as the roots of a significant "social disease" affecting the country, which persists for many years and is not solely attributed to the contemporary regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## A Regime of Terror and Fear (1923-1938)

From 1923 to 1938, [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkey]] experienced a "regime of terror" for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. During this period, people lived in a "tunnel of fear," constantly terrified at various levels and platforms, unsure of what might happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. There was a prevailing assumption that freedom would come only after the death of the leader, allowing people to finally speak their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### The Aftermath of 1938

When "the man" (referring to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk) died on November 10, 1938, a peculiar phenomenon occurred: people lost their honor and buried their personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. They were too scared to overcome this deep-seated fear and shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Instead, there was a "competition of praise" from "The Great Ones" to silence dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This inability to speak freely in 1938 led to significant psychological damage, which is considered the fundamental starting point of the social disease known as Kemalism or Ataturkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It resulted in a "suppression of consciousness" and a pushing of fear into the subconscious, which continues to self-perpetuate to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The speaker draws parallels with similar fears in the Soviet Union during Stalin's era and in Germany during Hitler's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In these systems, a dictator's wisdom was unquestionable and above all law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Post-Dictatorship Responses

*   **Germany**: Hitler's defeat and suicide helped German society to overcome their trauma, albeit imperfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union**: Stalin was surprisingly buried three years after his death, and his mistakes were revealed, though this self-criticism was done "in a low voice and hypocritically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Türkiye**: During the İnönü period, there were efforts to erase Atatürk from the stage of history and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. His images were removed from money, and the construction of a monumental grave was not started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Atatürk monuments were renovated and made less visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

However, with the change of government in 1950, a highly rational policy was adopted: instead of discussing the past, which both parties deemed dangerous, they tried to "put the past in a museum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. An Atatürk protection law was passed, his tomb was built, and he was transformed into a national symbol or "pantheon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. His image was returned to money, with the hope that he would gradually be forgotten as a symbol with emptied content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The Unconfronted Past

The speaker argues that the main reason for the Republic of [[Development and changes in modern Turkey | Turkey]]'s "great fiasco" within 100 years is the society's failure to confront the reality of Atatürk and his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Instead, a mythology about Atatürk has become "a halo of holiness," serving as a loyalty test for career advancement in state institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This was evident in the 1960s and again in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's "A Bitter Story"

The speaker refers to Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's 1945 book, "A Bitter Story," as an "astonishing" text that reflects the deep psychological suppression of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The book, seemingly a father's cry of pain, can also be interpreted as a testament to "infinite trust in Atatürk and Modern [[Development and changes in modern Turkey | Turkey]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. However, the speaker reads it as a "terrifying psychological suppression text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

The book discusses the suicide of Uşaklıgil's son, Vedat, a relative by marriage to Atatürk's wife, Latife Uşaklıgil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Vedat's life reportedly darkened due to injustices, culminating in his suicide while serving at the Albanian embassy in Tirana in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

The speaker highlights the book's strangeness: while it details Vedat's injustices, it provides "not the slightest information" about their nature or reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Rumors about Vedat, widely known in [[Social and cultural dynamics in Trkiye | Turkey]] at the time, are entirely unmentioned, making the book a peculiar work of "psychological suppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. The book avoids naming those who thwarted Vedat, even attributing blame to figures like Foreign Affairs Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras who claimed "the order comes from above" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

Halit Ziya, a symbol of Ottoman aristocracy and a renowned man of letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, was forced to beg for his son's career in Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. His efforts to meet Atatürk were denied, and he was told to write a petition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Even with Atatürk's intervention, Vedat was still mistreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. The book thus portrays the tragedy of a man crushed by the helplessness of protecting his son's honor against an unnameable power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. To fully understand the book, knowledge of this historical background is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

The transcript discusses the profound societal changes and potential conflicts arising from large-scale immigration, particularly focusing on Western Europe and Türkiye.

## Societal Decay and Conflict in Europe

England is described as a country that has been "terribly mismanaged for years" with "every institution and every class" showing signs of decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It functions as a "second-class state" trying to cling to the memories of a past empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Despite certain advantages, like speaking the language of the most powerful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, it possesses a "legendary bureaucracy with a corrupt and immoral political class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This mismanagement is likened to a "late Soviet bureaucracy that can't accomplish any job and messes up everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Under a 14-year Conservative party period, conditions consistently worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Inevitable Social Explosion

The accumulation of these negativities is highly likely to lead to a social explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. If millions of foreigners are allowed into a society "without establishing an ideological infrastructure" or "convincing the rest of the society," and if there is a "huge cultural gap" between them, a social explosion is deemed "inevitable" at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

In [[migration_issues_in_europe | Western Europe]] today, especially in France, England, and possibly Italy and Spain, a conflict based on race or between natives and immigrants is considered "inevitable" and likely to involve bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This is attributed to a lack of a common societal vision, where people no longer feel united or willing to work for the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Instead, they see each other as enemies due to differing cultures, languages, and races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The situation is predicted to reach a point of conflict, where it remains to be seen who will prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Shifting Power Dynamics

Natives, particularly "whites," often believe the state and army are on their side, enabling them to reclaim their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. However, the state structure appears to have lost its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Financial and monetary powers are not on the side of the natives; rather, they believe "the new proletarian class coming from outside is better for the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Furthermore, the natives' ability to fight without state support has atrophied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. In contrast, the "vast majority of immigrants" have grown up in violent environments, are accustomed to violence, and are prone to using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Given this trajectory, the emergence of an "Islamic Republic of England" within 20 to 30 years would not be surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

This course of events is compared to the final decades of the "Vara Empire in the 390s and 40s," with a similar atmosphere observed in [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | Western Europe and the United States of America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Migration in Türkiye

The sudden influx of millions of foreign elements into a society naturally causes locals to react with anger, leading to conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. While this reaction is understandable, it is an "obvious fact that there has never been an event in history where a large mass migration has been turned back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Once "toothpaste comes out of the tube," it does not go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

It is considered "really stupid" and "very ignorant" to believe that the millions of Syrians and Afghans who have lived in Türkiye for 5 to 10 years will or can be sent back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. These individuals will inevitably become a part of Turkish society, whether willingly or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Integration Policy

A serious state policy and public administration attitude must adopt a realistic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Calming the angry natives with "sweet words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   Focusing on educating newcomers to live in harmony with societal norms to integrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   Prioritizing the education of the "millions of children" being born to these foreign families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

It is believed that this crisis can be gradually eliminated over 10, 20, or 30 years through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Neoliberal World Order and Demographic Movements

The speaker discusses how the [[impact_of_social_and_economic_transformations_on_humanity | neoliberal world order]] of the 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by the disappearance of borders, led to free movements of both capital and human demographics between countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>. This internationalization, where goods are manufactured and packaged across different countries, was initially perceived as positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. The idea of a "supra-state libertarian civilization" as an inevitable and righteous future wave became widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>. However, this idea has since undergone a "terrible collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:00">[33:46:00]</a>.

## Japanese Economic Bubble and Its Collapse

In the early 1980s, Japan experienced a period of significant economic growth, emerging as a global economic giant. This dominance was particularly evident in the car and electronic goods sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. Japanese companies like Toyota, Datsun, Mitsubishi, and Sony strongly penetrated the American and European markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>. At one point, Japan's per capita national income became the highest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

### The Plaza Accords (1985)

In 1985, the United States convened its allied major economic states in New York for the Plaza Accords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. The U.S. expressed its inability to tolerate the situation, citing the invasion of its market by Japanese and German goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. As a result, the dollar's exchange rate against the yen was reduced by almost half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Additionally, customs duties of up to 1200% were imposed on Japanese electronic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

### Economic Aftermath in Japan

These measures led to a sudden end for the "Japanese dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. Japan's export-based economy struggled to cope with the recession, as it could no longer export goods to major markets like America and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. To combat the recession, the Japanese Central Bank injected money into the market, hoping to stimulate investment, industrial growth, and maintain its industrial dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

However, these calculations did not align with market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. Instead of increasing industrial production or competitiveness, the injected money primarily flowed into real estate investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. This caused real estate prices to explode and grow wildly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. In a panic, the Japanese government applied brakes to the money supply, leading to an instantaneous collapse of the entire real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Half of Japan's economy went bankrupt, and the country has not recovered control since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## United States Economic and Political Landscape

The recent [[donald_trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | Donald Trump's economic policies and their impact]] and his re-election are seen as a reaction to underlying societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. There was a belief that Trump would not be allowed to win the election, possibly through court actions or a conspiracy, given the perceived decay of democratic processes in the United States over the past 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. However, it appears that an influential group within America's ruling cadres wanted Trump to win, concluding that the departure of the current regime would not be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

Several factors contributed to this shift in public opinion:
*   **Economic Helplessness**: A significant portion of American society feels helpless due to an out-of-control economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. People struggle to afford houses, losing hope for basic rights like owning a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Public Influence**: The public feels they have no influence over the country's administration, with real political, economic, and ideological decisions made by a Washington elite that has "lost its course" and bypassed the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.
*   **Major Crises**:
    *   **COVID Scandal**: This was seen as a major crisis that seriously shook the country's trust in the ruling cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.
    *   **Ukraine War**: An unpopular war that the American state embraced with massive budgets, ultimately failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>. This led to a widespread feeling that the administration lacked strategic intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:54">[01:44:54]</a>.
    *   **Gaza Massacre**: The ongoing massacre in Gaza and Lebanon created an "extraordinary immorality, a moral crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. The government's perceived disregard for societal views and enforcement of certain perspectives, especially in schools, caused great outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>.

These factors culminated in a public perception of the regime as "morally rotten, incompetent, tyrannical and insensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:24">[01:46:24]</a>, finding a perceived opposition in Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:45">[01:46:45]</a>.

## Central Bank and Money Authority

Money is a symbolic asset with no intrinsic value, its value determined by social consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>. The growing concern is not merely that Central Banks can produce artificial currency, but that they possess the authority to distribute this money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. This power, exercised with the banking and finance system, allows Central Banks to direct money, which is seen as the most important source of power and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:50">[02:24:50]</a>. In democratic societies, elected governments supposedly hold power, but in reality, they have no authority over money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>. Central Banks and other related banks determine how much money is produced and who uses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>. Similarly, elected governments lack real authority over military and police forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:56">[02:26:56]</a>. Thus, the two most critical dimensions of social governance—money and weapons—are managed by mechanisms outside democratic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:22">[02:27:22]</a>.

## Turkish Economic and Political History

### The 1961 Constitution

The 1961 Constitution of Turkey has two main aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>:
1.  **Anti-democratic**: It was designed to prevent a government based on public vote from gaining absolute power, which could threaten the Kemalist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>. The previous 1924 constitution granted almost unlimited powers to elected governments, leading to what was perceived as tyranny under the Democrat Party government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:09">[01:55:09]</a>. The 1961 Constitution aimed to restrict democratic power through measures such as proportional representation (making absolute majorities difficult) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:35">[01:56:35]</a> and the creation of a "supra-government" called the National Defense Institution, which effectively governed Turkey from 1960 to 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:29">[01:57:29]</a>. High courts (Constitutional Court, Court of Cassation, Council of State, Court of Accounts) were also established to tie the hands of elected governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>.
2.  **Symbolic Freedoms**: It included many "nonsense rights" and freedoms translated from Western constitutions and UN conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:44">[01:58:44]</a>. These were seen as "soap bubbles" or "tricks" without real political power behind them, and many of these libertarian articles were cut down starting from the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>.

### Atatürk's Will and İsmet İnönü

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's will, written a week before his death in September 1938, included a provision for İsmet İnönü's children to receive a certain salary for their education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:35">[02:56:35]</a>. This is considered a strange and suspicious act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:45">[02:56:45]</a> because [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | İnönü]] had been purged approximately a year prior, dismissed from his prime minister position after a serious disagreement with Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:23">[02:58:23]</a>.

On October 29, 1937, during Republic Day celebrations, a crowd in Ankara's stadium cheered loudly for [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | İnönü]], who had been dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:47">[02:58:47]</a>. This was a dangerous event in a dictatorship, and [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | İnönü]] reportedly fled the stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:15">[02:59:15]</a>. For a year after that date, his name was not mentioned in the Turkish press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>.

As Atatürk's death became clear in 1938, speculation arose about his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:31">[03:00:31]</a>. Given Atatürk's suspicious and paranoid nature, it is unlikely he would have simply accepted [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | İnönü]] replacing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:50">[03:01:50]</a>. The will's provision for [[smet_nns_political_and_links | İnönü's]] children remains a question mark: did Atatürk believe [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | İnönü]] would die or be purged from politics, thus needing support for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:56">[03:02:56]</a>?

## Cultural and Societal Influences in History

### Timur, Atilla, and Genghis Khan in Turkish History

A significant ideological transformation in the Turkish Republic has been the elevation of historical figures like Timur, Atilla, and Genghis Khan to the ranks of Turkish greats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:46">[03:59:46]</a>. Historically, Timur was depicted in Ottoman historiography as the "epitome of evil," a cruel, ruthless, and irreligious figure who destroyed Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Atilla and Genghis Khan were also generally viewed as cruel, brutal, and enemies of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:05">[04:05:05]</a>.

The fact that these "barbarian leaders" have become national heroes is symptomatic of the Republic's ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:47">[04:07:47]</a>. Before the 20th century in Turkey, names like Atilla, Genghis, or Timur were not commonly given to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:01">[04:10:01]</a>. The adoption of these names as personal names since the 1920s is striking, marking a shift where figures historically seen as villains became ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:04">[04:20:04]</a>.

### German Romanticism and French Enlightenment

The speaker discusses the intellectual contributions of German Romantics, contrasting them with the French Enlightenment. German culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries often followed French intellectual movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:32">[04:46:32]</a>. When new ideas, such as the modern state theory by Jean Bodin in 16th-century France or the radical perspectives of Voltaire and Rousseau in the 18th century, emerged in France, Germans would adopt them but often mix them with religious, mystical, or local traditional elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:40">[04:47:40]</a>. This process transformed original, clear, and radical French ideas into something less original, emotional, or "slurry" in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:15">[04:49:15]</a>. Germany only began to produce genuinely original thought in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:47">[04:50:47]</a>.

### Origin of Baklava

There are thousands of stories about the origin of Baklava, none based on solid evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>. One story suggests it was invented in the Ottoman palace in Istanbul in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:54">[02:47:54]</a>. However, the best Baklava has historically come from Syria (including Antep), suggesting it was invented or at least widely accepted there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>. The speaker doubts Greeks invented any food until modern times, as Greece was a "deep provincial country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:36">[02:48:36]</a>. The origin point, whether Istanbul, Arab, or Syrian cuisine, remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>.

### Seljuk and Ottoman Architectural Heritage in Anatolia

Most provincial and district centers in modern Turkey were founded during the Seljuk and Beylik (principality) periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>. The current urban texture of these cities reflects the Seljuk and Beylik periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:05">[03:00:05]</a>. All impressive architectural works still standing in Anatolia, including mosques, madrasahs, bridges, caravanserais, and hospitals, date from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:20">[03:02:20]</a>.

In contrast, the Ottoman architectural heritage in the Anatolian countryside is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:35">[03:03:35]</a>. After the Ottoman conquest, mosques were built in every town and city, but they were generally standard, template-based structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:40">[03:03:40]</a>. Beyond the three Ottoman capitals (Edirne, Bursa, Istanbul) and a few significant complexes like Sokullu in Payas, little remains from the Ottoman period in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:05">[03:10:05]</a>.

The Seljuk period (roughly 1190s to mid-15th century) was a time of great urbanization in Anatolia, with cities and towns established at key points and trade centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:55">[03:19:55]</a>. The great mosques from the Seljuk and Beylik periods are notable for their unique and original architecture, unlike the template-based Ottoman mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:45">[03:26:45]</a>.

### Divriği Mosque and Armenian Architecture

The question of whether the Sivas Divriği Mosque was built by Armenian architects and workers is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:26">[03:28:26]</a>. From the 12th century onwards, architecture in Anatolia, both east and west, clearly drew from existing civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:40">[03:33:40]</a>. Islamic architecture east of the Euphrates is seen as a continuation of Armenian architecture, while west of the Euphrates, it is a continuation of Byzantine architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:53">[03:34:53]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the question of Armenian architects is "meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:41">[03:35:41]</a>. What is significant is that from places like Ahlat, a new Islamic synthesis was created upon the foundations of old Armenian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. This involved taking the technical mastery, forms, and traditions of Armenian architecture and reinterpreting them with a new Islamic spirit, style, and ideological meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:01">[03:43:01]</a>. Examples include Ahlat tombs, Tercan Mamahatun tombs, Erzurum tombs, and Divriği Mosque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:44">[03:44:44]</a>.

This perspective reveals that the "conquest" of Anatolia was not merely one group leaving and another arriving, but the emergence of a new civilization vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:02">[03:47:02]</a>. The original ethnic background of the creators of this new vision—whether Central Asian, native Armenian, or enslaved Armenians—becomes irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:12">[03:51:12]</a>. What matters is the collapse of an old ideological structure and the emergence of a new state, architecture, symbolism, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:40">[03:53:40]</a>.

### Avshar Community Origins

In Turkey, there are several distinct communities named Avshar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:21">[04:10:21]</a>. Predominantly, they are found in Kayseri and northern Adana provinces (Sarız, Yahyalı, Feke, Tufanbeyli) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:42">[04:10:42]</a>. There are also Avshars in Kars, Ardahan, and other areas, some of whom speak Kurdish and are Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:02">[04:11:02]</a>.

The name "Avshar" is associated with one of the 24 Oghuz tribes, mentioned in history since the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>. However, the exact nature of the Oghuz tribal order in the Ottoman Empire (whether ethnic, family, or military) is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:16">[04:12:16]</a>.

Another Avshar community in Turkey traces its origins to followers of Nadir Khan, an Avshar leader who seized power in Iran in the 1720s and 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:53">[04:12:53]</a>. After his death, some of his mixed group of followers, many of whom were Turkish speakers, migrated to Anatolia, particularly settling in the Kayseri region, and became known as Avshars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:36">[04:13:36]</a>.

There are also many villages named Avshar across Turkey, the Caucasus, and Western Iran (and possibly Syria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:35">[04:14:35]</a>. Interestingly, there's no established connection between these villages and the Avshar tribes, and the villages themselves are homogeneous and randomly scattered, some even being historically Greek or Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:02">[04:15:02]</a>. Conversely, places primarily settled by Avshars often do not bear the Avshar name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:20">[04:15:20]</a>.

The concept of a singular "Armenian Cuisine" in Istanbul is challenged, with the argument that "Istanbul Cuisine" is a distinct entity that transcends ethnic labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>. Similarly, a distinct "Turkish cuisine" or "Greek cuisine" in Istanbul is also deemed non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>.

## Istanbul Cuisine: An Imperial Blend

Istanbul, as an imperial capital, naturally developed a unique culinary tradition that is often referred to as "Istanbul Cuisine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. This cuisine is not defined by strict ethnic boundaries, much like how "New York Cuisine" or "Paris Cuisine" are recognized regardless of the chef's origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>. The capital's role as a center of power and sophistication encouraged the development of refined tastes and subtle cultures across various aspects, including food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.

In the traditional context of Istanbul, particularly in the 19th century, different ethnic groups played specific roles in the culinary landscape:
*   **Tavernkeepers** were often Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>.
*   **Cooks** were typically Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.
*   **Employers**, who appreciated and influenced the cuisine, were generally Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>.

While there might be minor distinctions, such as "topic" (a specific dish) being made only by Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>, the overall culinary style in places like Pasha's mansions tended to merge into a single "Istanbul Cuisine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. The employer's preferences (often Turkish) heavily influenced the dishes, leading to dishes like okra with olive oil being considered part of this broader "Turkish cuisine" due to the consumer's taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:53">[01:38:53]</a>. The quality and variety of this cuisine are noted to decrease proportionally with distance from Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>.

## Armenian Cuisine (in Armenia)

In Armenia itself, distinct culinary traditions exist, separate from Istanbul Cuisine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. These can be broadly categorized into two main styles, with a third notable, though unsuccessful, attempt at introduction:
1.  **Soviet Tradition**: This style, found in Armenia, is not significantly different from cuisines in other Caucasian countries and many Russian cities. It has gradually diversified and modernized over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.
2.  **Middle Eastern Cuisine**: A significant influence came from Armenians who migrated from Syria and Lebanon. This tradition has challenged and transformed the established Soviet-era restaurant culture in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
3.  **Istanbul Cuisine (Attempted Introduction)**: There was an attempt by a friend, a well-known Istanbul restaurant owner, to introduce Istanbul Cuisine to Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>. However, this effort was unsuccessful, as the cuisine was not well-received in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>.

Had the Greeks captured Ankara and overthrown the national movement's organization in 1921 or 1922, the course of [[turkish_historical_events | Turkish history]] would have been significantly altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This hypothetical scenario posits a different outcome to the Greco-Turkish War, specifically the campaigns that aimed to neutralize the Ankara government.

## Initial Greek Presence and Aspirations

The initial international agreement for Greece was limited to securing the province of Izmir and the district of Ayval覺k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The landing of Greek troops in these areas on May 16, following the Paris Peace Conference, was intended as a police operation to maintain public order in [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It also aimed to provide a safe haven for Greek refugees who had been deported from the Aegean Region by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. At this stage, raising their own flags or outright annexation of these cities was not on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

However, the Greeks harbored significant hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] in 1920, described as a "very strange text" and a "bargaining document," envisaged a five-year occupation of Izmir and Ayval覺k, followed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This implicitly meant that Izmir and Ayval覺k would be given to the Greeks after a five-year transition period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Expansion of Greek Operations and Objectives

Beyond these initial territories, the "Greek Operation" in 1920 and 1921 saw two major waves of expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The Greek Army left the borders of Izmir province, invading Nazilli, Bursa, and Ayd覺n, and in a second wave, reached the Sakarya River, aiming to capture Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This occupation of Western Anatolia was not intended as annexation to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Instead, its primary objective was to force the national movement in Ankara to surrender or bargain, or to eliminate the Ankara government entirely and deal directly with Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. It was fundamentally an intimidation and punitive operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Hypothetical Consequences of a Greek Victory

If the Greek operation had been successful, leading to the fall of Ankara, the scattering of the Ankara army, and its surrender, Mustafa Kemal and his associates would have been forced to withdraw as political players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

A new London Conference would have been convened to reformulate the [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] according to the new situation, given that the original treaty was "stillborn" and unsigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It is assumed that Izmir province, or at least its Aegean coast, would have been awarded to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A consortium or collective management, possibly involving Greeks, would have been established in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Geopolitical Ramifications

A Greek victory would have had profound geopolitical [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:
*   **British Dominance:** It would have meant that the British would become the sole diplomatic player in [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]], exacerbating an already serious widening of relations between France and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This would have led to an "endless and bottomless conflict" between the two, with Italy siding with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Turkish Resistance:** Despite military defeat, the Turks, forming the overwhelming majority of the country's population, possess a highly developed administrative class, including officers, civil servants, and intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. They would not have remained passive but would have engaged in a gradual struggle through economic, social, political means, propaganda, and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **British Strategy:** The British management style would have involved playing Greece against [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]], offering concessions to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Long-Term Outcomes and World War II Implications

If this scenario had persisted for 20 years, a British-ruled "new [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]]" would have emerged, similar to post-World War I Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, and Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | Turkey]] would likely have joined the "avengers camp," seeking revenge for perceived mistreatment in the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. There is "not the slightest doubt" that such a [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] would have joined the German alliance in World War II when the opportunity arose around 1938-1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This could have entirely rewritten the history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Unlikely Greek Victory

Despite the hypothetical scenario, a Greek victory in a prolonged war against [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] was considered highly unlikely by contemporary observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While the Greek and re-established Turkish (TBMM) armies were roughly equal in terms of soldier numbers (around 190,000-200,000 mutually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>:
*   **Demographic Advantage:** [[comparison_of_greek_and_turkish_military_and_economic_strength | Turkey's population]] was four or five times that of Greece at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Economic Strength:** [[comparison_of_greek_and_turkish_military_and_economic_strength | Turkey's economy]] was at least three times larger than Greece's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **War of Attrition:** In a long-term conflict (longer than one or two years), [[comparison_of_greek_and_turkish_military_and_economic_strength | Greece had no chance of winning against Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Military Tradition:** The Turkish army possessed a centuries-old war and weapon tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Political Homogeneity:** The political population of the Turks in the Aegean Region was overwhelmingly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

The only real chance for the Greek army was a swift, decisive victory, aided by strong British weapons, equipment, and financial support, before the Ankara government could organize its defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Once the conflict became a stagnant, frontal war after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece had no chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This assessment was known by the British, French, and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Personal Experience and Health Impact

The speaker has abstained from alcohol for two years, consuming only tea on their program, and states a complete inability to drink alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This condition is believed to be a result of diabetes, as even a drop of alcohol has a severe adverse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Historically, the speaker has never been a heavy drinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, though they previously enjoyed "a glass of whiskey during such a conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

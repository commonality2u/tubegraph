## Formation and Geopolitical Challenges
Armenia's current geopolitical situation is often discussed in terms of its historical development and challenges. A significant factor in its relative weakness is its lack of a sea border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the region where modern Armenia is situated was a small province established as a project of the Russian Empire, previously part of the old Iranian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Armenians from the Ottoman Empire and Iran were settled in Anatolia, leading to the creation of a region with diverse ethnicities and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

After the collapse of the "great Armenian project" in 1918, Armenia gained a limited independence as a form of consolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. This new entity was intended to be neutral, existing under the protection of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. As a consequence, it developed poor relations with all its neighbors, including Turks on both sides and Georgians to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. The lack of sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a> and its exclusion from major trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a> contributed to economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. While under Russia's influence, it couldn't establish a significant military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> and its hostility towards neighbors prevented rational cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This created a country where its existence was consistently at risk due to its isolation and internal dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

## [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian Success within the Ottoman Empire]]
In contrast to its later independent struggles, Armenians achieved disproportionate success in modern [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | history]] when they were subjects of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. This period, particularly in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, saw Armenians as a vital link in the modern world for the vast, culturally rich, but increasingly dysfunctional Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

By the end of the 19th century, despite being one of the world's largest states with immense economic potential and military resources, the Ottoman Empire faced economic regression and cultural isolation due to its inability to adapt to the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. The dominant Muslim element in the country had become suspicious of innovations due to historical fears and experiences, and there was a lack of an educated or entrepreneurial class capable of driving progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

Into this vacuum, with the encouragement of the Ottoman state, Armenians took on a crucial role in connecting the Empire to the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. They were pioneers in many fields, including:
*   Establishing photography workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   Founding theater groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   Setting up insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   Starting newspapers and printing houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.
*   Innovating in goods trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a> and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

They were numerous entrepreneurs, well-educated and capable of conducting business globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. For example, Armenians from Elazığ migrated to Brazil around 1895 and achieved great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. This success was deeply intertwined with the Ottoman Empire's needs and its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

The Armenian community, numbering about 3.5 million at the turn of the 20th century, produced an astonishing number of people who made significant contributions to humanity and achieved great things, with roughly one in ten reaching notable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

When conflicts broke out with the Ottoman Empire, many Armenians, especially those of Ottoman origin, migrated to Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, as well as Western countries like France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. For a generation or two, they continued to achieve remarkable things, often preserving their family traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

## The Soviet Period
The Soviet period (1920s, 30s, 40s) brought a different experience for Armenia, characterized by the emergence of new pioneers in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. Armenians demonstrated great success as leaders in technology, politics, urbanism, music, and chess within the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

However, the impact of the Soviet experience on Armenia is debated among Armenians themselves, with ambivalent and contradictory views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
Geographically, early 20th-century Armenia was not vastly different from neighboring regions like Kars, Ağrı, and Bingöl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Historically, people lived in simple mud houses, caves, and medieval villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. The Soviet era saw the creation of very modern, memorable towns and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>, with the construction of earthquake-resistant houses, uniform living standards, and amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

These projects, driven by the ideals of socialism in the 1930s, aimed for ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. However, by the 1960s, this progress halted, and Armenia became confined to a "miserable police state with narrow horizons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Since then, the country is seen as having made no significant steps forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>, and outside the capital, the landscape reflects the stagnation of the Brezhnev era, described as "pathetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Cultural and Religious Aspects
A question was raised regarding why Armenians do not have a pilgrimage tradition similar to Muslims going to Mecca/Medina or Christians to Jerusalem, who would often tattoo their faces as a sign of pilgrimage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. The speaker did not know the specific answer to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

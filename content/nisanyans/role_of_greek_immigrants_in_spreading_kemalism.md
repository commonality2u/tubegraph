[[kemalism_in_trkiyes_coastal_areas | Kemalism]] is widespread in coastal areas of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One of the primary social bases for its spread, particularly in the western parts of the country, is the presence of Greek immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Greek Immigrants as a Social Base

More than a million immigrants who arrived in Anatolia between 1878 and 1913 from regions such as Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Greece, were settled in the western parts of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These areas include the Marmara and Aegean Regions, especially the coastal parts of the Aegean, and the Western and Central Black Sea regions, forming an arc of settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Among these communities, the Republican People's Party and [[mustafa_kemals_political_strategies_and_legacy | Kemalism]] maintain a strong influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The claim that a 1400-year-old [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] is 99.5% similar to modern copies is regarded as a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The subject of the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]]'s compilation is described as "obscured with so many fallacies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, with "a series of fallacies, a series of half-truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> circulating.

## Late Transcription and Early Arabic Script

Contrary to popular belief, the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] was written down approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Hz. Muhammad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. There is no reliable data on what was written down before this period, where, or in what script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran|Arabic script]] was first codified and invented for the purpose of writing the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] around the 680s CE, during the time of Caliph Abdul Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In the earlier period, during [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Muhammad]]'s time and the 60 years following him, [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran|Arabic script]] consisted only of "graffiti" or "scribbles" of three to five words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran|Arabic script]] of that era lacked dots and movements, making it a "distorted version" useful only for taking notes, not for literary works or letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:02:15]</a>.

At that time, the written language of the Middle East was [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts|Syriac script]], used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The idea that [[historical_transcription_of_the_quran|Arabic]], a tribal language, could be written down did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Fabricated Compilation Narratives

The claim that a commission was established during the time of [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Muhammad]] and [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Hz. Osman]] to write down the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] is considered a fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This narrative was reportedly created approximately 180 years after the events, during the [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription|Abbasid period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This fabrication addressed the unease people felt about the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] being written long after [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Muhammad]]'s time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Scientific View of Compilation and Oral Tradition

Scientific and objective information suggests that the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] was compiled around 680 CE, during the [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription|Umayyad]] period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Until then, the transmission was primarily oral, with people memorizing and reciting these messages in mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, akin to [[aramaic_and_syriac_influences_on_quranic_texts|Syriac tradition]] and [[comparison_of_religious_narratives_and_their_evolution|Jewish tradition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Regional Variations and Political Standardization

When the [[religious_texts_and_interpretations|Quran]] reached the stage of writing, there were "different traditions" of the text in "every city, in every region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, including Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. These variations, where people claimed "We don't know that verse like that, we know it like this," were suppressed by the order of [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription|Hajjaj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. A single text was then created to align with the [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription|political interests]] of the common [[role_of_political_influence_in_quranic_transcription|Umayyad]] State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This standardized text emerged approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of [[controversial_historical_and_religious_figures|Hz. Muhammad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

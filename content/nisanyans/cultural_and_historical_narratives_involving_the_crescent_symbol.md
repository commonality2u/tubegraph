The crescent and star symbol holds a significant place in **[[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | cultural and historical narratives]]**, particularly within the Islamic world and beyond. It is fundamentally a Middle Eastern symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

## Origins and Early Use
The strongest theory suggests that the crescent and star was originally the sacred symbol of ancient Arab or Assyrian principalities located around Harran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Its widespread adoption in the Islamic world began in the 9th century when the Abbasid dynasty chose it as a state symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. They subsequently placed it on their money, flags, and other state emblems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. It is believed the Abbasids likely adopted this symbol from the Harran region during the final collapse of the Umayyad state, as one of the last caliphs reigned from Harran for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

### Roman and Byzantine Adoption
The crescent and star symbol also saw use within the Roman Empire for a period, similarly originating from Syria and Harran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. In the 3rd century, during the reign of Septimius Severus and his sons (Caracalla and Heliogabalus), a Middle Eastern dynasty from Syria (specifically Hama) ruled Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. Heliogabalus, in particular, attempted to establish an Eastern religion as dominant over Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Coins from some Roman emperors during this period feature the crescent and star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. This demonstrates how the symbol spread from the Middle East to both the Roman-Byzantine and Abbasid states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

## Islamic World Significance
The crescent and star symbol is deeply rooted in **[[islamic_architecture_and_cultural_hegemony | Islamic tradition]]**, specifically adopted from the Abbasid tradition by later empires like the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. It is not tied to any specific Turkish tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

For 1400 years, there has been a persistent aspiration within the Islamic world for a unified Islamic Ummah (community) and a single Islamic Empire governed by one legitimate authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. The crescent and star symbol represents this vision of an undivided empire, particularly the Abbasid Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

Today, the symbol can be seen on the flags of various nations, including Pakistan, Tunisia, and numerous Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

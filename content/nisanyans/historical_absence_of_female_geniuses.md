From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The historical record suggests a notable absence of female geniuses across various fields, a phenomenon described as consistent across different cultures and eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Observed Trends in Genius

There is an observed absence of female geniuses in fields such as arts, visual arts, and music, with this trend noted across ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, among Aegean and American natives, and in Islamic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While there are some good female writers, their numbers are few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Similarly, few women have emerged as prominent figures in [[role_of_women_in_politics_and_society | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Even when opportunities are provided, a "class of geniuses" from women in certain fields does not typically emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Biological Explanations

The assertion that this absence is due to oppression or male domination is dismissed as "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Instead, the explanation lies in human psychology and the understanding that [[gender_differences_in_intelligence_and_creativity | women and men have different biological functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Their genetic structures differ, leading to distinct psychological advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The primary [[cultural_and_societal_roles_of_women | biological function for women]] is related to giving birth and ensuring the safety, care, feeding, and survival of the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This biological imperative means that a woman's life has a specific function tied to being a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Men, conversely, are seen as having compensated for their biological "dysfunctions" or weaknesses in other areas, such as through skills and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Human Nature and Societal Roles

Human beings are fundamentally animals, not significantly different from monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Observing mammals, the distinct functions of males and females are very obvious and logical, driven by biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The human being's core function is related to sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, and what women and men can do in these functions differs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Society has added "decorations" such as science, art, and politics, which are compared to a peacock's decorated tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. These social organizations are seen as superficial layers over the fundamental biological reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Modern Interpretations

In modern society, where "tactile functions have acquired such complex, unnatural qualities," discussions about [[equality_and_rights_of_women_in_modern_society | women's rights]] and the degree of equality are considered necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, the underlying truth is that humans are animals, and certain biological realities must be acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The current age is characterized as one that prioritizes "ideological lies" over objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, making it difficult to openly discuss these observations. However, these points are presented as undeniable facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

A rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and [[Irans geopolitical situation and potential conflicts | Iran]], initiated by China, is considered a historical event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>. This development was one of three wishes expressed for the new year by the speaker, with the others being the overthrow of the Zelensky regime and prosecution for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. The fact that the Saudi Arabia-Iran rapprochement came to fruition is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

## Significance and Impact
This rapprochement is expected to fundamentally alter the balance of power in the [[Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. It signifies the end of a long-standing isolation policy against [[Irans geopolitical situation and potential conflicts | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>, representing a coming together of the Middle East's largest financial power (Saudi Arabia) and its largest military and population power ([[Irans geopolitical situation and potential conflicts | Iran]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. The speaker anticipates serious consequences from this shift, marking the end of a 30-40 year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.

### Western Strategy
For 30 years, the fundamental strategy of the West was to maintain a state of constant conflict and war between Saudi Arabia and [[Irans geopolitical situation and potential conflicts | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. The meeting between these two powers is therefore considered a historical turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

## Saudi Arabia's Transformation
Saudi Arabia has embarked on a radical transformation over the past five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>. They aim to surpass the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in becoming a global hub for modern architecture, ambitious engineering, production, culture, and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. They are prepared to invest substantial funds to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>.

The speaker notes that Saudi Arabia possesses financial resources that Western countries no longer have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. Prince Salman is understood to have concluded that America no longer represents a sound investment for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>, prompting the search for new investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. The speaker advises close observation of these developments, as something significant is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

## Public Awareness in Turkey
The speaker perceives that people in Turkey do not closely follow or adequately comprehend international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. This lack of understanding extends to the significant changes occurring in Islamic countries, where many people hold preconceived, negative stereotypes, such as believing that Islamic countries are dirty or judgmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. However, visitors to places like Qatar or the United Arab Emirates often experience a significant shock upon witnessing their prosperity, modernity, and progressive services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. While these are often city-states and exceptions to generalizability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>, Saudi Arabia's proximity and awareness of these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>, coupled with its immense wealth (ten times that of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates combined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a> and capable leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>, indicate a deliberate shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

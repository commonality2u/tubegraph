From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

This article presents analyses of certain phrases, expressions, and narratives found in the Quran, moving beyond a strictly Islamic perspective to explore their broader origins and meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This approach aims to provide a clearer, more powerful, and convincing understanding of the Quranic text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Dhul-Qarnayn

The text briefly mentions the story of Dhul-Qarnayn as a topic for [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The speaker intends to demonstrate that this narrative could not have originated from revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## The Story of the Seven Sleepers (Ashab al-Kahf and al-Rakim)

The Quran's Surah Kahf (Chapter 10) narrates the story of seven young believers who, to escape oppression, took refuge in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. After sleeping for hundreds of years, they awoke, unaware of the elapsed time, only realizing it when one was sent to the market with an old coin, astonishing the locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:49]</a>. This story is considered an allegory of the Apocalypse in Islamic belief, symbolizing future awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The Quranic narrative of the Seven Sleepers exhibits uncertainty regarding details, stating, "Some say 3 people. Some say 5 people, some say 7 people. None of them know anything. Don't ask them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Similarly, regarding the duration of their sleep, it says, "They stayed in the cave for 300 years but there are also those who say 309 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This narrative style creates the impression that the author of the Quran or Allah lacks complete knowledge on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

A key phrase in the relevant verse is "owners of the cave and the rakim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While "Kahf" clearly means "cave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, "Rakim" is described as a completely unknown or mysterious word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Interpretations of "Rakim"

*   **Classical Dictionaries and Commentaries:** Firuz Abadin's large dictionary offers various interpretations, suggesting its relation to "digit" (number or sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Early commentators like Ibn Abbas provided diverse meanings:
    *   The name of a valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   The name of a city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   The name of the mountain where the cave is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Mujahit: The name of their building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Dahak: Another name for the Cave itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Said Bin Jubayr: The name of tablets on which the men's story was written, placed at the cave's entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:12]</a>. These diverse interpretations highlight the word's ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **Turkish Translations:**
    *   Elmalılı Tafsir: Interpreted Rakim as "People of the Book" or "the stone inscription on which the names of the Companions of the Cave and the Rakim were written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   Directorate of Religious Affairs (Old): Translated Rakim as "the Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:43]</a>, linking it to the meaning "to make a sign, to symbolize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Directorate of Religious Affairs (New): Rendered it as "exemplary evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   Ahmet Tekin: Interpreted Rakim as "monuments erected on them" or "written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Yaşar Nuriye Öztürk: Translated it as "Inscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Syriac Origin Hypothesis for "Rakim"

The oldest known written version of the Seven Sleepers story dates back to the 5th century, narrated by Jacob of Sarugh (451-521 AD), a significant figure in the Monophysite Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:40]</a>. This story, widely circulated in Byzantium and among Syriacs, details the events in Ephesus during Emperor Decius's reign (around 250 AD) and their reappearance during Emperor Theodosius's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:11:23]</a>. The story was first written in Latin by Gregory of Tours in the 6th century, who explicitly stated he heard it from a Syrian source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:12:12]</a>. Most versions mention seven sleepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:27]</a>. The dog "Qitmir" associated with the sleepers is only found in Islamic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:21]</a>.

The hypothesis is that the word "Rakim" in the Quran originated from a misreading of the Syriac word "Deqim" or "Deyus" (referring to Emperor Decius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:15:22]</a>. The letters 'D' (Daleth) and 'R' (Resh) are very similar in Estrangelo, the ancient Syriac script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:27]</a>. This potential transcription error suggests that the Quranic account may be based on a written Syriac source that was orally transmitted and misread into Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:49]</a>. This implies a need for a non-Islamic, philological [[analysis_of_the_quranic_text_from_a_nonislamic_perspective | analysis of the Quranic text from a non-Islamic perspective]] to understand such terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:58]</a>.

## Houris (Hurin)

The term "Hurin" (Houris) appears five times in the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:33]</a>. For example, Surah Dukhan 54 states, "We married them to Hurin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:43]</a>, and Surah Tur 22-23 mentions "We married them to Hurin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Interpretations of "Hurin"

*   **Arabic Lexicography:** The word "Hurin" (or "Hur") is accepted as feminine and plural in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:35]</a>. Its singular form would logically be "Ayir" or "Ahwal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:42]</a>. From the root H-W-R, it can mean "white in color," suggesting "white houris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Eye-related interpretations:** Many interpretations link "Hur" to eyes, leading to meanings like "white-eyed" or "big-eyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:55]</a>. The *Kamus* dictionary (15th century) describes "Hur" as having "eyes with very white and very black white, like in gazelles and cows," emphasizing high contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   **Modern Turkish Translations:** Translations vary widely: "gazelle-eyed houris," "big-eyed houris," "black-eyed houris," "beautiful wives," "clear-sighted spouses," "snow-white," "hawk-eyed houris," "spotless concubines," or "beautiful-eyed, pure and clean spouses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:35:19]</a>. This variety reflects the term's inherent ambiguity in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:12]</a>.

### Hadith Descriptions of Houris

Hadith literature, particularly from Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, offers detailed physical descriptions of houris:
*   Their leg bone marrow can be seen through their skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:36:05]</a>.
*   They do not urinate, defecate, or spit, and their noses do not run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:25]</a>.
*   They have combs made of gold, and their sweat smells like musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   They are all identical, lacking genetic diversity, like monozygotic beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:44]</a>.
*   Their height is 60 cubits (approximately 40 meters), similar to Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   Their faces are white and bright like the full moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   Their bodies are transparent white, allowing bone marrow to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   Their bones shine like pearls and rubies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   They do not menstruate or bear children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:18]</a>.

### Zoroastrian Origin Hypothesis for "Hurin"

The word "Hurin" is proposed to derive from the Old Persian term "Hur" (or "Huru"), meaning "beautiful-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:44:31]</a>. This concept appears in the Zoroastrian text *Arda Viraz Namag* (Story of the Virtuous Viraz), written in Pahlavi (pre-Islamic Persian) in the 5th century under Sassanid rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:50]</a>.

In this text, the virtuous Viraz undertakes a spiritual journey. In the afterlife, his own piety and virtues manifest as a "beautiful woman" with "magnificent breasts" and a "beautiful face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:43:08]</a>. This woman replies, "I am the beauty of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:43:01]</a>. The Persian prefix "Hu" (good/beautiful) is akin to the Greek "Eu" (e.g., euthanasia for "beautiful death"), and "Ru" means "face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:44:26]</a>. Thus, "Huru" means "beautiful-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:31]</a>.

This concept of one's own soul appearing as a beautiful-faced woman in the afterlife is a well-established allegory in Zoroastrianism, predating Islam by centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:45:00]</a>. The older Avestan language, the language of original Zoroastrian texts, uses the term "hura" (beautiful-faced) extensively to describe virtuous and religious individuals, and even God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:46:01]</a>. This suggests that "Hurin" in the Quran could be a concretization of this Zoroastrian allegorical concept, which became literalized in Islamic tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:44]</a>. The difficulty in interpreting "Hurin" from an Arabic root alone supports this external origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Gehinnom (Gehenna) / Hinnom Valley

The Quran's concept of Hell (Jahannam) is linked to the historical and symbolic evolution of the "Hinnom Valley" (Gehinnom in Hebrew) near Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:50:06]</a>. "Gey" in Hebrew means "valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:15]</a>.

### Historical Context in the Torah and Jeremiah

*   **Torah:** The Hinnom Valley is mentioned 11 times in the Torah, sometimes as "Hinnom" and sometimes as "Hinnom Valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:36]</a>. Four mentions are purely geographical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Child Sacrifice:** Seven mentions refer to the practice of building altars and passing children through fire as a dedication to idols (e.g., King's 23:10, 1 Chronicles 28:3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:51:25]</a>. This was interpreted in later Jewish and Christian literature as child sacrifice, portraying idolaters in a negative light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:52]</a>. However, it's suggested it was originally a purification ceremony involving passing through fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **King Josiah:** King Josiah (Yos) destroyed this idolatrous altar in the Hinnom Valley (King's 23:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:53:01]</a>. This act led to the valley becoming associated with disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:23]</a>.
*   **Jeremiah:** After Jerusalem's destruction by Babylonians, the prophet Jeremiah's book (Jeremiah 7:31) describes the Hinnom Valley as a place where the bodies of sinful Jews would be thrown and consumed by animals, leading to its being called the "Valley of Tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:55:08]</a>. Jeremiah's rhetoric intensified the polemic against the "passing through fire" ritual, interpreting it as "burning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:47]</a>.

### Evolution of Symbolism

The meaning of the Hinnom Valley shifted from a geographical location to a symbolic place of cosmic crime, sin, and punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:58]</a>. The path to salvation (Mount Zion) was understood to pass through this "Valley of Tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:30]</a>.

In Talmudic texts and Aramaic translations (Targums), Zion becomes a symbol of heaven, guidance, and true faith, while Gehinnom symbolizes evil, torment, punishment, and darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:02:13]</a>. The idea of fire in the Hinnom Valley, though not explicitly in the Torah as hell, becomes common from the 2nd century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:25]</a>. This could be influenced by Roman practices of cremating the dead in a necropolis in the valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:03:30]</a>.

### Talmudic Interpretations and the Concept of Hell

*   **Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai (d. ~90 AD):** In the Babylonian Talmud, Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai describes two palm trees in the Hinnom Valley with smoke rising between them, identifying it as the "gate of hell where sinners will go after death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Talmudic Dialectic:** The Talmud, a vast collection of commentaries from the time of Christ to 600 AD, is characterized by continuous dialectic rather than final teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Evolution of Hell:** The concept of an afterlife punishment (hell) gradually took shape in the 2nd-3rd centuries CE, possibly influenced by external traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:48]</a>.
*   **Rabbi Yua Ben Levi (3rd century):** Argued that sinners pass through the pains of hell to reach guidance (Zion), implying that Hell cannot be an eternal torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish:** Countered that for some stubborn sinners, Hell is an eternal torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:34]</a>.

This [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | evolution and interpretation of religious texts]] shows how the concept of punishment for sin, initially tied to earthly retribution, shifted to an afterlife concept as a logical necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:15:06]</a>. The abstract nature of spiritual punishment led to increasingly vivid and exaggerated descriptions of torment, eventually leading to the logical dilemma of finite sin versus infinite punishment, often concluding with infinite punishment for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:16:11]</a>. This entire process, from concrete to abstract to unfalsifiable dogma, occurred over approximately 500 years in Eastern culture (600 BC to 600 AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:45]</a>.

## Other Linguistic Notes

*   **Isa (Jesus):** The Arabic name "Isa" for Jesus is believed to have been transferred from a Greek source (Iesous), as Greek lacks the "sh" sound in the original Hebrew/Aramaic "Yeshu" or "Yesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Yunus (Jonah):** Similarly, the name of Prophet Yunus (Jonah) in the Quran is thought to be from a Greek form rather than directly from the Hebrew Torah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Jahannam (Hell):** The Arabic word "Jahannam" is a direct phonetic descendant of "Gehinnom" (Hinnom Valley) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:52]</a>. In some Egyptian dialects, the letter 'Jim' is still pronounced as 'G', maintaining the original sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:12]</a>.

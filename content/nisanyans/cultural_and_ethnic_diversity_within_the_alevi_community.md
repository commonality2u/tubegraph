The Alevi community, as understood today, largely crystallized as a distinct religious and social movement in the 1400s, concluding in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This movement originated as a protest against classical Islam, specifically a religious reform movement against Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The Ottoman state viewed this as a deadly danger and suppressed the Alevi movement ruthlessly for centuries, exiling them and declaring them illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Consequently, a core characteristic of Alevism is a resistance against Islamic bigotry and the Sunni Islamic model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Alevism is an eclectic movement, drawing elements from various cultural and religious backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. It is not limited to a single ethnic group, and its adherents have diverse origins.

## Ethnic Composition

The Alevi community is a patchwork of various groups with different ethnic backgrounds and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>:

*   **Turkish/Turkmen Alevis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>: Approximately half of the Alevi population in Türkiye identifies as Turkish or of Turkmen origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. Many of these tribes in Anatolia did not fully convert to Sunni Islam, remaining in a "slippery position" between Islam and other options before joining the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. They often identify strongly with Turkmenism and Central Asian heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Alevis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>: A significant portion, about 40 percent, of the Alevi population in Türkiye is of Kurdish origin, speaking Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. They have adopted [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] despite having no direct connection to Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Kurdish Alevis are found both east of the Euphrates in Kurdistan, and west of the Euphrates in areas like Malatya, Sivas, Tunceli, and Erzincan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. They often define themselves primarily as Alevis, viewing it as an ethnic identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Arab Alevis (Nusayris)**: An Arab Alevi population exists in Antakya and Hatay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. While sometimes referred to as Nusayris, this community has a completely different tradition, including unique temples, forms of worship, and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. They are also prevalent in parts of Syria on the Mediterranean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The Nusayris have no connection to Turkishness and are culturally and traditionally similar to Arab Christians in Hatay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Albanian and Bulgarian Alevis (Bektashis)**: Alevis are also found in Albania and Bulgaria, particularly in e-Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. In southern Albania, almost the entire Muslim population is affiliated with Bektashism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. In the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria, where the Ottomans faced difficulty in direct rule and taxation, a significant population also holds a tradition of radical state hostility, aligning with these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Distinct Sub-Groups within Alevism

Beyond ethnic lines, the Alevi community includes culturally distinct sub-groups:

*   **Tahtacı** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>: These are forest villagers primarily found in the mountains of the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, from Antalya to Mersin and Çanakkale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Though sometimes called Yoruks, their appearance and culture differ from other Yoruks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Historically, they have lived more nomadically and had limited harmony with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. They are largely involved in timber cutting and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. Tahtacıs possess a different and more "primitive" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>, and are not typically associated with leftism, with many even voting for the MHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Abdals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>: Found particularly in the south of Central Anatolia, around Gaziantep, Abdals are also considered Alevis but have a distinct culture and tradition from other Alevi groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. They are often involved in music and entertainment as a professional social group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. While sometimes associated with Romani people by Anatolian populations, Abdals define themselves as a distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Famous figures like the folk singer Neset Ertaş were Abdals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. They generally hold a strong anti-state stance and do not take mainstream Islam seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

Overall, the common theme unifying these diverse groups is their historical position outside the state's dominant Sunni ideology and their resistance to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

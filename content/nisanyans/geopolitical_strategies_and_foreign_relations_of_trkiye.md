Türkiye's current [[geopolitical_issues_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | geopolitical issues]] and [[international_relations_and_geopolitical_shifts_involving_turkey | international relations]] are deeply intertwined with its internal [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | political developments]] and social dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The prevailing political climate significantly influences the nation's foreign policy approach and its standing on the global stage.

## Domestic Political Context and External Perception

The domestic political situation in Türkiye is characterized by a significant erosion of the rule of law and democratic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. What was once seen as a problematic but principled belief in justice has "completely shattered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The legal system is perceived as being manipulated by a tyrant, with incidents like the Ekrem İmamoğlu case being "just a drop in the bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. High-profile figures like Osman Kavala, Ahmet Altan, and Salahattin Demirtaş have been imprisoned unlawfully for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The concept of popular will and democratic legitimacy, though often imaginary, has been "destroyed visibly and systematically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The government's sole objective appears to be maintaining its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This has led to widespread social discontent, especially among the youth, whose hopes and future have been "stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Don't forget that on one side there are young people, and on the other side there is a monster in human clothing, a raving, foaming dictator." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

Rebelling against tyranny is presented as a right and even something that adds meaning to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While street demonstrations can serve as a "justification or excuse for another coup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, they are unlikely to directly change the government, as significant armed force is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The speaker dismisses the idea of regime change through elections, stating that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will not leave power "unless he dies or a serious amount of blood is shed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

The democratic parliamentary regime in Türkiye is considered to have effectively ended in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The Republican People's Party (CHP) is seen as having a primary function of providing a "veneer of legitimacy for the regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> and preserving the "appearance of democracy" to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## [[Turkish Foreign Policy and Relations During the nns Era | Turkish Foreign Policy and Relations During the Current Era]]

### Shifting Global Democratic Norms
The perception that Türkiye can "openly cancel democracy" without significant trouble stems from observed democratic backsliding in its allied and patron states, including Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Examples cited include controversies surrounding elections in Romania, Georgia, and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This global trend suggests that the multi-party parliamentary regime, a standard since 1945, is losing its function, legitimacy, and credibility worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Key institutions of public administration, such as security, intelligence, and money management, have largely moved "beyond the control of the parliament" and political cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Furthermore, foreign states and institutions have "infiltrated every level of the administration," as evidenced by the dissolution of US AID, which revealed extensive foreign financing of NGOs and civil society in 190 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Regional Engagements and [[Challenges faced by Trkiye in establishing a regional influence | Challenges]]

#### Syria and the Kurdish Question
Türkiye's involvement in Syria is viewed as a "huge mistake" that has led the country into a "quagmire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. The goal of controlling Damascus is seen as unrealistic and bound to end in disappointment, as regional powers like Israel, the Arab world, and Iran would not permit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

A more "logically correct" and "rational move" for Türkiye would have been to:
1.  Draw Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan) to its side, separating it from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. This could lead to an agreement similar to Northern Iraq, where Rojava is indirectly governed by Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
2.  Become the "protector and guarantor of the Syrian Alawites," especially given the Damascus regime's inability to control them and the presence of a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

Instead, Türkiye pursued control over Damascus, a project deemed impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.

A broader strategy for Türkiye's influence in the Middle East should involve assuming a "patronage, an alliance, a protective role over the former Ottoman Kurds," specifically those in Iraq, Syria, and Türkiye, excluding Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

#### Relations with Iran
The idea of Türkiye being "dragged into war against Iran for the interests of Israel" is dismissed as "great stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. Türkiye is not perceived to have a serious conflict of interest with Iran, as their centuries-old border is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. While there are frictions over the Kurdish issue, it is not expected to escalate into direct conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

During Qasem Soleimani's time, there was a possibility of conflict due to Iran's perceived control over Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, raising concerns about Iranian expansion to the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. However, this threat is no longer apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Current conflicts with Iran over Azerbaijan and Armenia are not expected to lead to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

#### Approach to the Balkans
Türkiye should take actions to "alleviate the concerns and fears of the countries in the Balkans that have historically close ties with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. This cannot be achieved through "Islamic fanaticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, as it hinders Türkiye's ability to be a "serious and reliable friend and ally" in countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia, or Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. The "classical policy of the Ottoman Empire" and Byzantium was a "butterfly policy" centered on Istanbul, with influence in Rumelia and parts of the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

## [[Historical Evaluation and Critique of Turkish Foreign Policy | Historical Parallels]]

The current Turkish regime, described as a "fascist regime that has lost its popular support and has no friends abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>, is compared to the "last years of Abdulhamid" (1895-1908) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. Like the current regime, Abdulhamid's rule started with reformist energy but eventually became a "gloomy, angry, hateful, and isolated regime" that relied on "fear and hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. This regime, which lasted 13 years in its later, isolated phase, ultimately fell due to a military conspiracy, not street demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

Kemalism is not being eliminated; instead, it appears to have been assimilated and made part of the dominant state ideology, which is now "a strange mixture of Kemalist, nationalist, Islamist and Ottomanist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Türkiye is heading towards a "big explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. This current uprising, similar to the Gezi Park protests, will likely be suppressed in the short term, as it lacks an "organized and armed structure" necessary for regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. The political situation in Türkiye is expected to "explode" and "disintegrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

The speaker believes that a "solution process" with the Kurdish movement is unlikely, as the Turkish regime is not perceived to have good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. The ongoing division between the Kurdish movement in the East and the "Izmir movement" (Western opposition) is considered the "most important guarantee of the regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. Reconciliation between these two factions is deemed crucial for any significant political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

Ultimately, the real dynamic that will determine Türkiye's future, as part of Western civilization, is not the bureaucratic oligarchy or populist leaders, but the "furious youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. The scope and limits of their potential violence remain to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The international community's muted reactions to events in Türkiye are attributed to their understanding that the opposition movement has "no chance in the short term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

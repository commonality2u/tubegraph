Canada's immigration policies are discussed as a notable case study, particularly when compared to European approaches to [[migration_issues_in_the_united_states_and_europe | migration issues]]. The speaker, who has personal ties to Canada, highlights Toronto and Montreal as contrasting examples of policy outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

## Toronto: A Model of Successful Integration

Toronto is presented as one of the cities globally where [[global_immigration_trends_and_their_impact | immigration]] has yielded the most successful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. The city is characterized by its significant diversity, with "old Canadian white Canadians" forming a very small minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Toronto hosts people from "200-odd countries," including Haitians, Turks, Kurds, Greeks, and Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. These diverse groups are noted for living "very peaceful[ly] and in harmony," contributing to a lively city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

However, a perceived "superficiality and inadequacy" stemming from a large first-generation immigrant population means that institutions and structures necessary for a truly interesting and attractive cultural and social life may not yet be fully formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Building these takes time, "a couple of generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. Despite this, Toronto is considered "one of the rare experiments in the world where such a hybrid thing can live together in peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

## Montreal: Stagnation Due to Restrictive Policy

In contrast to Toronto, Montreal, once considered "the most enjoyable, the most urban, the most developed, the most cultured city in North America" in the 1970s and early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>, has "stagnated and regressed" over the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This decline is attributed to a specific immigration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

Montreal, located in the province of Quebec, has a bilingual population speaking both English and French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. However, the provincial government, which is French-speaking, implemented a policy in the 1970s and 80s to "only accept immigrants who speak French" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This policy severely limited [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]] to mostly French-speaking African countries and Haiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. As a result, Montreal fell "far behind" Toronto in terms of population diversity, qualified personnel, restaurants, and quality labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

## Lessons for Europe

The successes of Canada's [[mass_migration_and_its_societal_impact | immigration]] policy offer "many lessons to be learned" for European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. France is cited as a country that "could not do this job" well, and Italy is seen as "heading towards a bad place under the shadow of a big failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. In contrast, Canada, described as an "empty and huge country," has found "a serious development opportunity thanks to immigrants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

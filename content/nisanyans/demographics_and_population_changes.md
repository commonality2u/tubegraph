Demographic trends worldwide, with the notable exception of Africa, indicate a significant decline in birth rates and a resulting population regression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:54">[01:18:54]</a>. This phenomenon is observed across Western countries, including [[immigration_and_societal_challenges_in_western_countries | Western Europe]] and the United States, as well as in countries like South Korea and [[migration_and_demographic_changes_in_trkiye_postearthquake | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

## Current Trends and Statistics
*   **Global Decline:** A radical decline in birth rates is widespread, with Africa being the primary exception where the fertility rate, while falling slightly, remains at a replacement level, allowing for continued population increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58">[01:20:58]</a>. South America and India also show increasing populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.
*   **South Korea:** The fertility rate has plummeted to 0.68 births per woman. For human populations to remain constant, a fertility rate of at least 2.1 is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>. This rate in South Korea implies that two-thirds of its current population could be eliminated within one generation (approximately 30 years), potentially reducing a 60 million population to 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   **Western Europe:** Fertility rates are around 1.1-1.2 births per woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>.
*   **United States:** The fertility rate is slightly higher than Western Europe but still well below 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
*   **Türkiye:** Fertility rates among Turks have also significantly fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Demographic Decline
Three primary factors are identified as contributing to the global demographic collapse:

### 1. Women in the Workforce
Encouraging women to pursue careers outside the home, family, and village is seen as an event that radically suppresses the fertility rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

### 2. Delayed Marriage and Extramarital Affairs
*   **Delayed Marriage:** The trend of pushing marriage age to older ages seriously impacts the fertility rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>.
*   **Normalization of Extramarital Affairs:** This trend inevitably leads to the disappearance of the meaning of marriage, as individuals may have numerous long-term relationships before considering marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. This instability discourages people from having children, as the foundation of marriage becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

### 3. Housing Affordability
The astronomical rise in house prices and the near-zero opportunity for young people to own a home are significant deterrents to starting families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. This is contrasted with observations in Africa where houses can be built rapidly and affordably by communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>. The speaker highlights that in a well-functioning society, a young person should be able to afford a home with a few months' income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>. Russia and other former Soviet/Socialist countries have high rates of private home ownership, often without rent, mortgage, or property tax, contrasting sharply with many prosperous Western countries where home ownership for the young generation is often unimaginable without great wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. This situation is deemed a "great administrative disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## Historical Context of Population Changes in Anatolia
Population changes are not new. For example, Anatolia experienced a significant decline in its population, wealth, and culture from the 15th century (Shahshahi period) to the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

### The "Greengrocers" (Manav) of Anatolia
A specific case study of [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | historical migrations]] and [[demographic_and_cultural_changes_in_the_ardahan_and_kars_region | cultural changes]] is the group known as "greengrocers" (Manav) in [[migration_and_demographic_changes_in_trkiye_postearthquake | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

*   **Geographic Concentration:** Their historical and current settlements are primarily concentrated in the Ottoman province of Hüdavendigar, which includes Bursa, Balıkesir, southern Çanakkale, Bilecik, İzmit, and Adapazarı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. This term is specific to this administrative unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   **Administrative Term:** "Greengrocer" was an administrative and legal term applied to Muslim agricultural populations in this region, excluding non-Muslims and nomadic Yoruks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.
*   **Origins and Conversion:** A significant portion, possibly the majority, of these people were original Byzantine inhabitants who converted to Islam and adapted to the Ottoman state's political and administrative conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
    *   Conversion was not primarily due to forced conversion or philosophical enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.
    *   A key factor was the Ottoman state's confiscation of church properties upon conquest, which debilitated Byzantine monasteries and their ability to educate and sustain the clergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. This led to generations of "blind and ignorant" people without institutional religious support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. In this environment, Muslim religious teachers and institutions filled the void, teaching children the narratives, ceremonies, and prayers of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Migration Influx:** The Ottoman conquest also created a "gold rush" effect, attracting diverse populations (Turks, Armenians, Persians, Kurds, Arabs, Romani) from various regions, who settled in Western Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. These new arrivals, at least on paper, were Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. Over generations, intermarriage and adaptation led to a mixed population where original differences blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.
*   **Cultural Continuity:** Local traditions and cultural elements, regardless of their religious or ethnic origin, continued through new generations learning from old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. The speaker dismisses race-based historical narratives as "crazy nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

## Urartian King Menua and Malazgirt
The name of Malazgirt (modern Manaz Gert) comes from the Urartian King Menua (Manav) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. The city was likely founded by him or an ancestor with the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:08">[04:50:08]</a>. The discovery of Urartian kings and their kingdom in the early 20th century confirmed this historical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## Hemşinlis and Migration
A significant portion of the population in the Tortum and İspir districts (north of Erzurum) are known as Hemşinlis, speaking a variant of the Hemşin dialect of Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. Their migration to this region is largely attributed to the period after 1828-1829. When the Russian army invaded Erzurum province and then withdrew, a large part of the Armenian population (over half) also withdrew with them to Russian territory (modern Armenia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. This emptied many villages in Erzurum, leading to a significant migration of Hemşinlis from the north to settle these areas around 1829-1830 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

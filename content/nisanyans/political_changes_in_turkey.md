## 2023 Evaluation and Global Context

The year 2023 marked significant global and internal shifts for Türkiye. Worldwide, the most impactful event was arguably the immense success of Chinese cars in the global market, with sales nearly doubling for two consecutive years, reaching around 6 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This has particularly affected Europe, including Russia, whose markets have been "invaded" by cheaper, more reliable, and solid Chinese cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This trend poses a serious challenge to the European, especially German, automobile industry, which relies heavily on automotive companies for its economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The speaker anticipates this will be an important turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Another major global development is a demographic transformation, particularly in the United States, where for the first time in history, the number of immigrants (mostly illegal) has exceeded the number of births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. A similar situation is occurring in Europe, leading to political consequences, notably the rise of "extreme right" or anti-immigrant parties that advocate for indigenous culture and are against the European Union project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. While the European Union may not disappear, its expansion projects are seen as unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Social tensions in the U.S. have reached unbearable points, potentially leading to an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

The third significant event is the "Ukraine fiasco" or defeat of the Western alliance, which will be recorded as an important turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Despite initial expectations of Russia's collapse due to sanctions and internal unrest, the Western alliance's war efforts could not be sustained, leading to an "absurd counter-offensive" by Ukrainians that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Western industrial capacity proved unprepared for large-scale armament, unable to produce sufficient tanks, missiles, or effective planes compared to Russian alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Following this, a "second and equally large fiasco" appears to be unfolding in Gaza, where Israel, despite its military and economic superiority, seems stuck and unable to achieve its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This ongoing conflict raises serious doubts about its continuation and resolution, particularly within Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. These events collectively signify a "change of era" globally, characterized by economic, demographic, and military turning points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

### Domestic [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | Political Changes]] in Türkiye

The most important event in Türkiye in 2023 was the definitive bursting of the Republican People's Party (CHP) "balloon," which had been inflated for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. Türkiye is an important cornerstone of the Western alliance, especially militarily, and its strategic alignment in potential future conflicts is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Since 1946 (or even 1933-34), the assumption has been that Türkiye would remain part of the Western alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

However, since the Erdoğan government came to power, serious doubts have emerged in the Western world about Türkiye's continued alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. From around 2007 to 2016, Western powers reportedly planned to remove [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Tayyip Erdoğan]] via a military or mixed military-civilian coup to install cadres loyal to Washington and Brussels, but they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. From 2016 or 2017 onwards, they shifted to projects aimed at changing the government through elections, hoping to achieve a +1% result by uniting the CHP and other parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. This strategy culminated in the 2023 elections, which "ended in a fiasco," forcing them to "bow to the truth of Tayyip Erdoğan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. Following this, they began efforts to marginalize Erdoğan and limit his influence within the government through different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.

### Türkiye's Role in the Middle East and Regional Dynamics

The potential for a war in the Middle East is extremely strong, and the roles of Türkiye and Saudi Arabia are considered vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia has undergone radical changes in the last year, moving away from being a "servant of the Western military alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. It made peace with Iran, signed a military cooperation and friendship agreement with Russia, and agreed to sell oil and natural gas in non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia is also set to officially join BRICS, a club of countries seeking to avoid American financial hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. During the Gaza War, Saudi Arabia maintained a "frightening silence" and adopted a "wait and see" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.

In contrast, Türkiye continues to support Israel economically, building on a long-standing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. However, through the words of its head of state, Türkiye has adopted a "propaganda and attitude that is extremely provocative and extremely worrying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. If a war erupts between Arab countries and Israel, Türkiye's role will be "vital" and a "matter of life and death" for Israel and Western countries if Türkiye does not participate alongside Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>.

Recent football events, including a "racist" incident, are seen as deliberate provocations aimed at fueling Arab hostility in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>. The use of Atatürk-themed t-shirts and slogans that insult the host country suggests a prepared rage-inducing strategy, driven by interests beyond simple patriotism or nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. The speaker finds it absurd that Atatürk, long used as an icon of hostility by the ruling party, is suddenly presented as a "national value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

### Constitutional Crisis and Historical Context

Türkiye is experiencing a constitutional crisis, where the government systematically disregards decisions of the Constitutional Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. A constitution is meaningful only if political and social actors agree on it and if there is an independent arbitration institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>. This crisis is not unique to Türkiye, with similar issues in Israel and other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.

The idea of countries being governed by written constitutions originated in the 18th century from social contract theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. It was first systematically attempted in the United States and then in post-revolutionary France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>. While England never had a written constitution, relying instead on an "elite consensus," this consensus no longer exists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. Türkiye's first constitutional attempt was in 1876, which failed, and it came to the agenda again in 1908 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>.

### The Ottoman Empire's Decline and the Republic's Cadres

The question of what would have happened if Sultan Abdulhamid had remained on the throne until 1918 is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>. After 1890, the Abdulhamid regime entered a period of "stagnation and decay," with widespread hatred among educated people and a desire to emigrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:00">[54:21:00]</a>. Blood circulation in managerial cadres stopped, leading to an aged, corrupt, and ineffective administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:33:00">[55:33:00]</a>. The empire became a "Miskinler Tekke" (dervish lodge of the poor), as depicted in Tevfik Fikret's poem "Fis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>. By 1908, nearly all qualified cadres were imprisoned, exiled, or assigned to remote posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>.

The Abdulhamid regime collapsed with "a single telegram" in 1908, when reformist officers in Thessaloniki demanded the declaration of the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>. Despite Abdulhamid's initial efforts in 1876 to modernize the country through education (establishing middle schools, high schools, law schools, and a university) and medical advancements (like a rabies and microbiology hospital), his attempt to fix the country through bureaucratic means and suppressing politics ultimately led to stagnation and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. The optimism that followed his overthrow in 1908, with widespread celebrations, lasted only six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

Regarding the transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey, the overwhelming majority of state cadres, except for the top executive level, continued their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. There was a significant continuity in the state order, with 90% of cadres remaining the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Political cadres, largely organized around the Union and Progress since 1913, were systematically "cleaned up" or killed, with some forced into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Former Ottoman high bureaucrats, including Grand Viziers like Ahmet İzzet Pasha, Ali Rıza Pasha, and Salih Hulusi Pasha, generally retired and lived quiet lives in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Shaping the Republic: Key Social Groups

Four main groups played significant roles in the structuring of Türkiye during the Republican period:
1.  **Circassians and other Caucasian immigrants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31:00">[01:15:31:00]</a>: Expelled from their homelands in the 1860s and 70s, they held a strong sense of gratitude towards the Turkish state. Their experiences instilled a determination to fight non-Muslims within the country and foreign entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03:00">[01:16:03:00]</a>. They were armed and eager to fight, proving their loyalty to the Turkish state despite some wavering between the sultan and Ankara during the independence war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00:00">[01:17:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Balkan Turks and Cretan/Rumelian Turks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04:00">[01:18:04:00]</a>: Having experienced expulsion from their homelands, they were determined to prevent a similar fate. They understood how small problems could escalate into overwhelming waves of rebellion if the state failed to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34:00">[01:18:34:00]</a>. While their fighting tradition was weaker than the Circassians due to a more peaceful peasant and urban background, they still contributed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53:00">[01:19:53:00]</a>.
3.  **Black Sea people** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44:00">[01:20:44:00]</a>: Known for their tradition of conflict and self-protection, they migrated to Istanbul and Western cities due to economic difficulties, forming a "Black Sea mafia" (in the classical sense of solidarity) that became influential in politics and state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02:00">[01:21:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Kurds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42:00">[01:21:42:00]</a>: Especially since the 1990s and 2000s, Kurds gained significant influence and power in Türkiye's large and small cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51:00">[01:21:51:00]</a>. Despite discrimination in state bureaucracy, they are increasingly reaching key political positions, disproportionate to their population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16:00">[01:22:16:00]</a>.

### Assimilation Policies and Cultural Identity

During the early Republic, there were assimilation policies aimed at forcing Turkish-speaking groups, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to speak Turkish. Those who did not comply faced harassment, punishment, and expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48:00">[01:25:48:00]</a>. This continued until the 1960s, and the forgetting of these facts while remembering Mustafa Kemal Pasha as a symbol of progress is seen as "pathetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28:00">[01:26:28:00]</a>. Similar assimilation policies were implemented throughout the 20th century in other countries in the region, including Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03:00">[01:48:03:00]</a>.

The speaker also addressed the claim that "greengrocers" (a local Muslim group from the South Marmara region) are not Turkish. He clarifies that while their origins may differ, a very large part of them were Rums (Byzantine subjects) who converted to Islam and adopted a new culture under Turkish rule in the 14th-15th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05:00">[01:51:05:00]</a>. This is evidenced by the ruins of old churches in almost all "greengrocer" villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:46:00">[01:52:46:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that "Turkified" groups are indeed Turkish, as being Turkish, French, or Japanese is a cultural adoption, not solely an ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31:00">[01:53:31:00]</a>.

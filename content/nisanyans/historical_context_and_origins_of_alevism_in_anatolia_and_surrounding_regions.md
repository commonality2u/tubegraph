The question of whether [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is an [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | Islamic interpretation of old Turkish beliefs]] is often raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, there is no clear information on the exact number of [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevis]] in [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | Türkiye]], with estimates ranging from 8 to 10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Diversity Within Alevi Communities

The [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | Alevi community]] is diverse, comprising several distinct groups:
*   Approximately 4 to 4.5 million individuals are defined as Anatolian Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Another 4 million are Zazas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, with slight indications of being Turks in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   A significant community known as Hatay Arab [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevis]], or Nusayris, resides in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These Nusayris hold a more radical line in their beliefs compared to the other two groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   In Thrace, there are [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | Alevis]] of Albanian origin, potentially connected to Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   The Tahtacilar are an element in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions whose origins are "completely unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. While they speak Turkish, their emergence and formation are not documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. One French researcher concluded that the Tahtacılar existed before the arrival of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Rejection of Ancient Turkish Origins

The claim that [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is linked to [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | ancient Turks]] is dismissed as "shameful" and without basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It is asserted that [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] has nothing to do with [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | old Turkish beliefs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Emergence as a Rebellion Movement

[[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is identified as a [[rebellions_and_social_integration_of_alevism | rebellion movement]] that emerged across all of [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | Anatolia]], Iran, and Syria at the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This was described as a "tremendous uprising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The movement aimed to leave or oppose Islam, often sheltering itself "under the filth of Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Diverse Participants in the Uprising

Various groups joined this [[rebellions_and_social_integration_of_alevism | movement]]:
*   **Old Turkmen Elements**: These groups had been in constant [[rebellions_and_social_integration_of_alevism | rebellion]] since the 13th century, frequently rebelling when opportunities arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They refused to pay taxes to the state and would not "bow down" to state teachers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Kurds**: A significant portion of the [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Kurds]] joined the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Armenians and Christian Converts**: Armenians and those who had converted to Islam were also part of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Nusayris**: Nusayris, who historically had "nothing to do with Islam," joined because the new [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | Alevi model]] suited them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This included Christian converts and old Arab Christians from the coastal parts of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Formation of Alevi Identity Through Oppression

The state responded to this revolutionary movement with severe oppression, including massacres, bans, and raids on villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This oppression, however, served to unite the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. As a result, a distinct [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | Alevi culture]] formed, characterized by a defensive posture, the development of secret codes, and solidarity organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]], in this context, is defined by these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Modern Interpretations and Turkism

The attempt to connect [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] to [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | old Turks]] is described as a "mental pathology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This perspective suggests that since [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevis]] may not feel they belong to the Muslim ummah and harbor hostile feelings towards Sunnis, they seek an alternative identity in "Turkism" – the idea of coming from Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This narrative is seen as a "fairy tale" used as a shelter, forming an "ugly ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

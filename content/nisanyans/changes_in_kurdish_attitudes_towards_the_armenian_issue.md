The role and attitude of the Kurds concerning the Armenian issue, particularly the events of 1915, have undergone significant historical shifts, moving from active participation in violence to a more recent period of introspection and changed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Kurdish Involvement

The "Armenian incident" is not solely defined by the events of 1915 but rather by a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Before 1915, the Kurdish element was identified as a primary cause of hardship for Armenians, leading them to abandon their homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Individuals defining themselves as Kurds, especially those under the control of Kurdish tribal leaders and later sect sheikhs, were described as experts in acts such as killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing properties, burning churches, and beheading priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

During this period, Armenians frequently preferred to see the Ottoman State as their ally and protector against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It was typical for Armenians to seek refuge with Ottoman governors against attacks from Kurdish aghas, relying on them for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Kurdish Role in 1915

The year 1915 is characterized as an "annihilation project" carried out by the Union and Progress administration and Ottoman state bureaucracy with conscious, cold-blooded decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. To "completely cleanse" the Armenian issue that had been a problem for the Ottomans for a century, the state organized extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In this process, [[kurdish_collaboration_with_ottoman_state | Kurdish Bey aghas]] and the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish people]] were utilized as allies, helpers, and subcontractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an existing tradition of massacre and extortion among the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The Turkish state successfully exploited this in the Eastern provinces by implicitly or explicitly granting permission for violence, assuring perpetrators that the state would support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Shifting Perspectives and Recognition

Studies indicate that there was significant hostility towards the Armenian Church, in particular, rather than solely the Armenian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Around the 1880s, a realization began to set in among Kurds. After widespread looting and usurpation of Armenian property, as well as the taking of women, there was little left to gain in the Anatolian countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Following this, Kurds reportedly "came to their senses," realizing they were now directly confronting the [[kurdishturkish_relations_and_nationalism_in_turkey | Turkish state]] and risked destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

More recently, particularly over the last 20-30 years, the attitude and approach of the Kurds towards the Armenian issue have changed radically to an appreciable extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This change is viewed as a positive development, similar to the need for Turks to overcome their own prejudices and ignorance regarding the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

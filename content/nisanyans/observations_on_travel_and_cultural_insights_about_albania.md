The host recently spent several days in Albania, a neighboring country, for official business, extending the trip to explore the nation further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This marked their third visit in a year and a half, leading to a growing fondness for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Impressions of Tirana

Initially, the host harbored prejudices against Tirana, having heard it was a "bad city" permeated by the gloomy atmosphere of the communist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. However, this perception proved to be entirely incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Tirana is described as a large, complex, multi-dimensional, and crowded metropolis with modern and wealthy neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Its bazaar is very colorful, and there is an incredible abundance of cafes, creating a pleasant impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Religion and Identity in Albania

A significant [[religion_and_identity_in_albania_and_its_historical_transformation | cultural insight]] gained from these trips concerns Albania's unique religious landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Unlike neighboring countries like North Macedonia, Kosovo, and [[life_and_moving_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]], where Albanians are predominantly Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, Albania itself is distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The Albanian populace is characterized by a seemingly "insoluble" division into various religions and sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. While slightly more than half are Muslim, this includes both Sunni Muslims in the north and Bektashi Muslims in the south, which are considered distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Additionally, there is a significant Orthodox population (around 25%), particularly in Southern Albania, influenced by Greek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Religious Division

What sets Albania apart in the Balkan, Anatolian, and Middle Eastern regions is how religious distinction has largely ceased to be the primary element of identity, or perhaps never was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. In contrast, in many other regions, religion is the most fundamental factor determining identity, often leading to hatred and disdain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. However, Albanians have somehow managed to overcome this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Instances include cemeteries with Christian and Muslim graves side-by-side, and extremely common mixed marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

This achievement is largely attributed to the Enver Hoxha regime, which governed from 1944 to the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. From the 1960s onwards, the regime banned all religions, closed places of worship, and declared atheism as the state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. However, this secularization policy predates Hoxha, with strong efforts to create a single Albanian nation evident during the Kingdom period before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. For about a century, significant efforts were made to overcome religious differences and forge a common national identity, which appears to have been largely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: King Zog I and the Balkan Wars

Albania was a kingdom for a period, ruled by King Zog I (originally Ahmet Zogolli), from around 1928 to 1939-1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Zog was the son of a feudal lord from Northern Albania and studied at Galatasaray High School in Istanbul, speaking perfect Istanbul Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. He entered politics after Albania declared independence in 1912, becoming Prime Minister before declaring himself King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

Understanding Albanian history is crucial for comprehending certain 20th-century events in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. After 1878, it became clear the Ottoman Empire would lose Rumelia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. A key issue was the establishment of a "reserve Turkey" under the guise of an Albanian state in the Western Balkans, a region with a Muslim majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. The idea was to create a powerful Muslim Albanian state in a large area, expected to be dynamic and warlike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. This "Great Albania" would encompass parts of current Albania, all of Kosovo, half of North Macedonia, and northern Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

The possibility of a strong, independent Albania spurred the Balkan Wars in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Albanian rebellions from 1910 onwards indicated a desire for separation from the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. In response, Serbia and Greece formed an alliance, attacking from multiple sides to prevent the emergence of a powerful Muslim Albanian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. As a result, Albania was carved up, and a much smaller Albanian state was established with European assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This reduction of both Albania and Bulgaria eliminated perceived dangers to the regional balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

## Visit to a Bektashi Lodge and the Melamet Philosophy

The most intriguing part of the trip was a visit to a Bektashi lodge, called Melani Tekkesi, located in the very south of Albania, near the Greek border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. This lodge is not mentioned in tourist guides and is difficult to reach via very bad roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

During the visit, the host inquired about "Melamilik" (Melamet) but could not get a clear answer from the dervishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. Melamet is described as a thought movement, not a sect, that emerged in the 12th or 13th centuries in Islamic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. It's considered the most radical moral theory, with similar ideas found in Western mystical traditions and in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

The core idea of Melamet is that virtue is often two-faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Trying to appear virtuous or showing off one's virtue is an act performed with the aim of humiliating others, asserting superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. The Melamet philosophy suggests that to reach true virtue, one must be condemned, blamed, and humiliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. The path to humility and breaking the ego is through being perceived as a sinner, a "terrible radicalism" that places dynamite at the base of all moral theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. This concept reminds the speaker of Jean Genet's works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

The host notes the difficulty of finding proper information about Melamet in Turkish texts, often encountering vague or nonsensical descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>. More coherent explanations are typically found in English sources, indicating a lack of logical and rational publications on Islam in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

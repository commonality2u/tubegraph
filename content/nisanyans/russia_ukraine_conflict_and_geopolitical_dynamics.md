This article explores the ongoing [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Russia-Ukraine conflict]], including its military progression, potential peace treaty terms, and the broader geopolitical implications, particularly concerning [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] expansion.

## Military Situation in Ukraine

As of the current assessment, the Ukrainian army is considered to have practically collapsed, suffering great losses and withdrawing from several cities one after another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. It appears that the entire state of Elegance has been taken under the control of Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. The rest of the Ukrainian Army is reportedly busy escaping in a disorderly manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. It is predicted that Crimea will also fall into the hands of Russian forces without much conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

The speaker's personal prediction is that after key regions are under Russian control, there will be a pause in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Russia is expected to wait for Ukraine to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a> and engage in a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Proposed Peace Treaty Terms

A potential peace treaty is outlined with the following key provisions:
*   Ukraine would give up its rights to the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   Ukraine would accept the establishment of an administration with wide features in Russian-controlled regions, which would be an independent state nominally dependent on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   Ukraine would accept to withdraw from all military relations with [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] and the United States of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   Ukraine would remove racist oppression laws enacted after 2014, which aimed to make Russians of Russian origin second-class citizens in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   Russia would likely not object to Ukraine becoming a candidate country for the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

However, it is deemed unlikely that the current Ukrainian administration, which is perceived as being under the control and occupation of the United States and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>, would accept such a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. They would be forced to continue the war even knowing they will be defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. The speaker argues that if Ukraine had considered the well-being of its people, it would have engaged in talks with Russia earlier to find reasonable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

### Future Predictions for the Conflict
Given the predicted rejection of a peace treaty, a second phase of the war is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Russia is expected to advance to Kharkov in the north and seize territories in the south, including Odessa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Despite the rhetoric from [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] and European countries, they are not expected to directly intervene in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. They will continue to provoke Ukraine and encourage it to fight, but will not do their part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

The speaker predicts that the first part of the war will end with a Russian victory, and the second part will also result in Russian success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Once Odessa falls under Russian control, Ukraine will become a landlocked Eastern European country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, inevitably leading to a neutral and unbiased position by cutting its military relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

The speaker criticizes the "empty propaganda" channels that portray [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] as powerful and Russia as a torturer losing hundreds of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>, suggesting they are slowly facing the facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Implications

### Risk of World War III
The speaker believes that a World War III will not break out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a> because Western powers cannot bear the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. While the Western world has significant military strength, including nuclear weapons, they are perceived to lack the military discipline, experience, political will, and political ground to sustain a serious war for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Russia and China are identified as two extremely powerful resources with a strong tradition of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. Russia is also noted as having the only army in the world with real war experience right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

It is also highlighted that great wars in history have always been accidents, not intentionally started, often caused by unexpected mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

### Sweden and Finland's [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] Membership
Sweden and Finland, which maintained a neutrality policy for seventy years and were elements of stability, have made a "mad move" by pursuing [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] membership, directly increasing the risk of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. It is suggested that inexperienced and foolish politicians in these countries were convinced by [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | NATO]] soldiers, generals, and intelligence officials to take this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

This decision is problematic because it places two hostile blocks directly in front of Russia's second most important city, St. Petersburg, and the entire hinterland of northern and western Russia, effectively squeezing Russia's access to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This act is likened to hostile tribes setting up camp on both sides of one's door, and it is believed that this will inevitably lead to conflict in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. The speaker is sure that the "so-called Western side" will be the one to take a step towards conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

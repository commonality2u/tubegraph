Türkiye faces significant challenges not primarily due to its population being "uncouth" or predominantly peasant, but rather from issues within its [[educational_system_and_values_in_Trkiye | education system]] and the state of its educated classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. While some newly urbanized populations have struggled to adapt from village to city culture, the root cause of many problems lies in the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_Turkey | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Failures of the Education System

The core issue in Türkiye is the poor education of its [[role_of_educated_classes_in_Turkey | educated classes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The [[failures_in_the_turkish_education_system | biggest fiasco and biggest defeat of the Republic of Turkey in the field of education]] has been its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Although there was success in extending basic education to large masses after 1950, by opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, a society requires more than just minimum-level education for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. It is crucial to raise an elite group that can lead society and shape its intellectual landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Historically, the only opportunities for elite education came from a few schools established during the Ottoman period, many by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The Republic of Turkey, however, did not allow these institutions to develop or increase in number; instead, they became smaller, their budgets narrower, and their scope more limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Consequently, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in Türkiye have gradually declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This level of education is now largely confined to a very small, lucky minority who had the opportunity to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

The current domestic [[educational_system_and_values_in_Trkiye | education system]] is criticized as little more than a "stupid brainwashing program" that teaches subservience and how to be a civil servant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. As a result, it has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Even elite religious education has been prevented, leading to a significant decline in the quality of Islamic religious experts compared to the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Public's Thirst for Knowledge

Despite these educational shortcomings, there is a profound hunger for knowledge among the people of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. The Anatolian people, for example, show endless love and respect for scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Even individuals with unconventional ideas are met with respect and attention, as people attach great importance to knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

There is a tremendous thirst for knowledge on basic issues, particularly religious ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. People listen intently, even to radical ideas, if explained seriously and lovingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. They display immense curiosity about topics like the universe, existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, Turkish history, [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_Turkey | social structure]], and [[political_and_social_issues_in_Trkiye | political and social issues]] such as the Armenian Genocide, the Kurdish issue, the Syrian issue, and Atatürk's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. They view such discussions as finding "an oasis in the desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

## The "Half-Educated" and Alienated Elites

A segment of Turkish society, estimated at one to two million people, is described as "half-educated Turks" or "white Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. These individuals are characterized by ignorance, moral degradation, a lack of social responsibility, and a self-serving mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. They are considered a "scourge" culturally and morally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. However, it is noted that this is not their fault, but a result of the flawed [[educational_system_and_values_in_Trkiye | education system]] that fails to instill a mission of guiding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

Above this group are the "real elites," estimated at around 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. These individuals are also terribly alienated from Turkish society and have no vision or hope beyond leaving Türkiye as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Unable to leave themselves, they strive to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. This situation represents a great tragedy for the country, where a population hungry for knowledge is deprived of proper guidance and leadership from its educated classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

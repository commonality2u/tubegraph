Should one have the opportunity to converse with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk within the current framework of status, personalities, and positions, it is suggested that one might be intimidated by his power, arrogance, and charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The speaker hypothesizes they would simply agree with him and leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, in a different, more intimate scenario, such as being confined together, various questions about his political appointments and activities would arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Unexplained Absence and Re-appointment During World War I

Questions would be posed regarding what happened after [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks wartime activities | Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]] returned from Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. During World War I, while serving on the Syrian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, his name was associated with "dark events" involving Cemal Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, a coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, and accusations of corruption, specifically selling army horses and keeping the proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Following these allegations, he was pardoned from his duties and was "missing for a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It is notable that during the "hottest days of the war," this "most talented and most successful" Ottoman commander (a colonel or brigadier general at the time) had no assigned duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. After approximately six months, he was then assigned to a "very sensitive task, a very serious political task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Appointment as Vahdettin's Political Caretaker

Another key area of inquiry would be the background behind his appointment as Vahdettin's "host" or "political caretaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In December 1917, Vahdettin became the new crown prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Anticipating Sultan Re≈üad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, Vahdettin was sent on an extended visit to Germany, an ally in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments | Mustafa Kemal]] was assigned as his political caretaker for this "very sensitive task, a very vital task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This appointment was particularly significant given that Vahdettin, over 60 years old, was described as a "shy, cowardly old gentleman" who had never been involved in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, yet was sent to meet a powerful figure like the Emperor of Germany during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Mysterious Leave in Austria

A third point of questioning would concern his activities in Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In May and June of 1918, during a critical period of the war, he was sent for a prolonged holiday and treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Before Karlsbad, he stayed in a hostel in Vienna for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The publication of a diary from this period, detailing mundane events such as "the dog of the hostel owner was barking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, is noted as unusual. It raises questions as to why a commander holding "the most important and politically sensitive posts" in a country would be sent on a two-month holiday to Austria during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## The "Double Game" After Samsun

Finally, a key question would be about his alleged "double game" after going to Samsun, extending to Amasya and even Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The speaker would inquire about the truth of this, noting that Vahdettin and Damat Ferit Pasha sent him to Anatolia with "incredible authority" and an "important mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, only for him to "suddenly turn against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Such conversations about these critical political appointments and decisions would likely be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. It is observed that powerful leaders often craft their own narratives and do not easily allow them to be shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

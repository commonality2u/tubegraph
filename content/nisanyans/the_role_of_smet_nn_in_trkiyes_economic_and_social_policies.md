İsmet İnönü, a central figure in the history of the Turkish Republic, is presented as a manager who, while sharing the goals of the revolutionary regime, often prioritized stability and demonstrated a cautious approach to governance, particularly in economic and social spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Economic Policies

İnönü's economic policies were characterized by a cautious and "arrested" approach, stemming from his deep understanding of the state's financial weakness and powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. During the 1930s and 1940s, his financial policies were conservative, leading to accusations of being strict or even cowardly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. However, after 1946, with the opening of credit lines by the United States, İnönü gave the green light for a rapid economic expansion policy in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

During the war years, measures such as the 1942 Wealth Tax and the conscription of the 20-22 age group were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[00:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[00:12:56]</a>. These policies, although seen as harsh, were influenced by the dire financial state of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. His cautious personality is cited as a reason these punitive measures were not pursued to their extreme end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Social Policies and Reforms

İnönü's social policies were marked by a complex interplay of ideological convictions, pragmatic considerations, and responses to internal and external pressures.

### Distance from Turkism and Pro-Nazi Sentiments
After 1930, İnönü consistently distanced himself from the Turkism movements that proliferated in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. He had a long-standing animosity with figures associated with the Turkish Hearths school, such as Reşit Galip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This animosity escalated into a "blood feud" with Turkists after he broke the pro-Nazi structure in Türkiye through arrests in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This stance contributed to [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkism]] becoming a major cleavage line in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkish politics]] after 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Approach to Rebellions and Reforms
İnönü played a leading role in the "bloody suppression" of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. However, he adopted a more moderate stance during the 1936 Dersim Rebellion, which led to his dismissal from office and political death due to his opposition to Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. His stance on Dersim was described as a speech in parliament completely opposite to Atatürk's preferred line, advocating for focusing on welfare and peace after the suppression of the rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

Unlike Atatürk, İnönü's interest in Western culture and law was sincere, not merely for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He actively tried to cultivate a love for classical music among the people, a passion he developed in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:23:00">[37:23:00]</a>.

Upon assuming leadership, İnönü took significant steps to rehabilitate figures previously deemed "traitors," such as Karabekir, Rauf Orbay, Halide Edip, and Mehmet Akif Ersoy, recognizing them as national heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. In 1938, perhaps as a step towards erasing the traces of a 15-year period of "power intoxication," Atatürk's picture was removed from money and other public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. This was part of a broader effort to gradually erase the Atatürk cult, which was seen as an "exaggerated eastern-style participation work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:49:00">[46:49:00]</a>.

İnönü prioritized practical, "real revolutions" over flashy, symbolic reforms like the Hat Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Examples include the planting of tea in Rize, bananas in Anamur, and the eradication of diseases like Menemen and malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. He aimed to replace "Kuvayi nationalist gang members" with young, educated cadres and supported initiatives like the Village Institutes, though he later succumbed to pressures that led to their closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Land reform projects also came to the agenda during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

### World War II and its Aftermath
İnönü is credited with keeping Turkey out of the disaster of both World Wars, a significant achievement that should be remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Despite the hardships faced by the people during these years, including ration cards, forced labor, and military pressure, the suffering was considered minimal compared to countries like Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union that entered the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Turkey's entry into the war on the side of the Allies was seen as a loss for the Allies, and İnönü skillfully navigated a "two-faced policy" to avoid joining the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. Preventing the sale of minerals like chrome to Germany was also a key diplomatic effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

### Treatment of Non-Muslims
During the war years, the government showed hostility towards non-Muslims. The speaker noted that the majority of the non-Muslim male population was taken to "concentration camps" twice within two years, though they were later released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Earlier, in 1934, a high-level decision was made to expel the Jewish population west of Istanbul, leading to attacks on Jewish shops and property confiscation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:23:00">[59:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:28:00">[59:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02:00">[01:00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06:00">[01:00:06:00]</a>. This policy aimed to concentrate the non-Muslim population in Istanbul, and during the same period, remaining Armenian communities in Anatolia were also "purified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52:00">[01:00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58:00">[01:00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02:00">[01:01:02:00]</a>.

### Post-1950 Career and [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Political and Economic Challenges in Turkey's History]]
İnönü's career after 1950 is described as a period of him adapting to the changing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. He was the first, and possibly only, National Chief to leave power willingly after an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. In the 1960s, he played a crucial role in "braking" the radical direction after the 1960 military coup, pushing for a softer, "half-baked" democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. He sided with the more institutional wing of the army that advocated for a return to party order after dismissing the out-of-control Democrat Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>.

However, his later years saw him engage in "town politician fights" with Demirel and support the military sentence in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. His resistance to losing his office to the younger Ecevit at age 87 damaged his reputation and contributed to the "fossilization" of major positions in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.

### Relationship with Atatürk's Legacy
İnönü expressed sincere admiration for Atatürk's intelligence and dominant personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. However, he was disturbed by Atatürk's alcoholism and the way the country was governed through "big decisions" made during late-night drinking sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. Their relationship was that of two close allies who managed the country for 17 of Atatürk's 19-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>.

Despite their close working relationship, İnönü never wielded the same absolute sovereignty as Atatürk, and there was always a significant faction within the party that kept its distance from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. After Atatürk's death, İnönü's sudden, unanimous election as president was highly surprising, given that he had been politically sidelined and his name was dangerous to mention in the last year of Atatürk's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:00">[53:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:39:00">[55:39:00]</a>. This decision, made in less than 24 hours, remains largely unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a>.

After 1950, particularly with the rise of the Democrat Party, the Atatürk cult was resurrected through an "organized, systematic, conscious policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>. This included enacting an Atatürk protection law, prohibiting insult to his memory, reviving the Anıtkabir project, and distributing Atatürk busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>. This phenomenon is seen as a political decision to maintain national unity during a risky transition from a single-party regime to a democratic, competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:00">[44:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49:00">[44:49:00]</a>. However, this "mortar" weakened towards the end of the 1950s, only to be re-imposed by the military after the 1960 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>.

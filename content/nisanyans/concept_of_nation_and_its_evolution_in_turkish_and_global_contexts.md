## Understanding the Concept of Nation

The term "nation" has undergone a significant evolution, particularly in the Turkish and global contexts. Originally, the word "nation" (millet) in Arabic means religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. This meaning is consistent in early Turkish usage; for instance, Ottoman dictionaries for 900,000 years prior to the Republic equated "nation" with "religion" and "sharia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The classical Arabic reference dictionary, Kamusa, also defines "nation" as religion and sharia, meaning "the path followed in terms of belief, worship, and deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

In the Quran, the word "nation" is mentioned 15 or 18 times, and in standard Turkish translations, it is consistently rendered as "religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. For example, phrases like "unless they follow the nation of Jews and Christians" or "We did not turn away from the nation of Abraham" illustrate this religious connotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. The speaker suggests that the exact Turkish equivalent of this word should be "Torah," encompassing "the whole of the traditions, rules, beliefs, and narratives that define a nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. This aligns with the Greek concepts of *ethos* (from which "ethics" is derived) or *nomos*, referring to customs, traditions, and laws, both written and unwritten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

Historically, until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "tribe" or "nation" in cultures worldwide (Europe, Islamic world, China, India) was not defined by biological race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Instead, it was understood as a "cultural entity" – something learned and gained through education from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. Attempts to determine a tribe through DNA or genetic research are considered ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

### Evolution of the Concept in Turkish Context

The concept of nation in Turkey began its [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | strange evolution]] with the onset of modernism around 1876 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

*   **Ahmet Vefik Pasha (1876):** In his dictionary, he stated that "nation" originally meant "religion and sect," while "Ummet" meant "tribe and congregation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Şemseddin Sami (circa 1900):** Noted that "nation" was inadvertently used instead of "Ummet," and vice versa. He highlighted the "wrong expressions" like "Islamic nations" and "Turkish nation," indicating an early awareness of the conceptual shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Mehmet Baha Bey (1924):** His "new Turkish dictionary" provided a definition of "nation" that became standard in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. He defined a nation as:
    > "a community of people who live on the same land, of common origin and language, or have been living in the same country for a long time, who are under the administration of the same government." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>
    He also noted that the "real meaning in Arabic is sect and religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

However, the speaker argues that all of Baha Bey's listed factors for defining a nation are flawed:

*   **Territorial Unity:** Invalid, as nations like the Jewish, Armenian, or Turkish (Greeks, Iraqis) live across different lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Common Origin:** Physically impossible, as nations are historically mixed through various migrations and intermarriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.
*   **Common Language:** Invalid, as exemplified by multilingual nations like the Swiss or Ethiopians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. India, for instance, has 18 officially recognized religions and countless languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.
*   **Common Interests for a Long Time:** Many nations, such as Slovaks, Azeris, Ukrainians, or Kurds, have not historically shared common interests for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Under the Administration of the Same Government:** Not true for all nations, like Koreans or Kurds, who live under different governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

### The Modern Concept of Nation

The modern understanding of "nation" is a new concept, emerging after the French Revolution with the advent of compulsory general military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
> "The citizens of a state are called a nation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>

This definition implies that anyone carrying the state's identity card and owing military service and taxes to the state is part of that nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. However, this simple bureaucratic definition clashes with the ideological framework required for people to sacrifice for their nation. Ideologically, the narrative is "first the nation, and then the state," implying that people came together as a nation and established a state to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. In reality, it is the other way around: "First there is the state and then the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. The state, through its bureaucratic apparatus, defines who belongs to the nation based on rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

This ideological reversal leads to a lack of logical answers when questioned about the origin or definition of a nation beyond bureaucratic registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.

### The [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkish Nation]] and its Formation

The "nation" that founded the Turkish Republic was systematically created and packaged between 1915 and 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This process involved selective inclusion and exclusion:
*   Hundreds of thousands of Christians and Jews, despite having no mother tongue other than Turkish, were "excluded from the nation and deported" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   Conversely, many Albanians, Circassians, and Kurds who did not know Turkish were included in the [[cultural_and_historical_analysis_of_turkish_identity | Turkish nation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
This demonstrates that language was not a consistent criterion in the formation of the modern Turkish nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

Such complexities surrounding the concept of nation continue to be relevant in understanding [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkish politics]] and identity discourse, influencing [[role_of_nationalism_in_modern_trkiye | nationalism]] and [[racism_and_nationalism_in_turkey | racism in Turkey]].

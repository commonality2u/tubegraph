If hypothetically speaking with [[Mustafa Kemals early political and military career | Mustafa Kemal]] within the framework of current statuses and positions, it would likely be impossible to say anything critical, possibly only deferring with "Mr. President, you are right" before leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, under different circumstances, such as being confined in a prison cell for five years, there are questions about his World War I activities that would be asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Unexplained Absence and Allegations from Damascus

Questions would arise regarding what transpired upon his return from Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. During World War I, [[Mustafa Kemals early political and military career | Mustafa Kemal]] served on the Syrian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During this period, he was reportedly involved in "dark events" connected to Cemal Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

He faced multiple accusations, including:
*   Involvement in a coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Corruption, specifically selling army horses and pocketing the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Consequently, he was pardoned from his duties and went missing for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It is notable that during the "hottest days of the war," a commander considered one of the Ottoman State's most talented and successful, was left without a duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. After approximately six months, he was then assigned to a "very sensitive" and "serious political task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Appointment as Vahdettin's Host

A key inquiry concerns the "inside story" of his appointment as Vahdettin's host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In December 1917, Vahdettin became the new crown prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Anticipating Sultan Re≈üad's death, Vahdettin was sent on an extended visit to Germany, the Ottoman Empire's ally and protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemals association with Vahdettin | Mustafa Kemal]] was assigned as Vahdettin's political caretaker, a "very sensitive" and "vital" task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This assignment is particularly curious given Vahdettin's age (over 60) and his lifelong exclusion from politics, described as a "shy, cowardly old gentleman" sent to meet powerful figures like the Emperor of Germany during a "life-or-death war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Vienna and the Published Diary

Further questions would be posed about [[Mustafa Kemals early political and military career | Mustafa Kemal]]'s activities in Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In May and June 1918, during a critical period of the war, he was sent on a long holiday and for medical treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Before going to Karlsbad, he stayed in a Vienna hostel for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Intriguingly, a diary from this period was published, which details mundane activities like morning walks and a barking dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The need to publish such an ordinary diary raises questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It is notable that a commander holding "the most important and politically sensitive posts" in the country would be sent on a two-month holiday to Austria during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Post-Samsun "Double Game" Allegation

A significant question would concern the allegation of a "double game" played by [[Mustafa Kemals early political and military career | Mustafa Kemal]] from his arrival in Samsun through to Amasya and Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The inquiry would explore how Vahdettin and Damat Ferit Pasha, who sent him with "incredible authority" and a vital mission to Anatolia, were suddenly turned against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> "I mean, both [[Mustafa Kemals association with Vahdettin | Vahdettin]] sends you and sends you with a very important mission. Well, Damat Ferit Pasha signs the decree, they send you with incredible authority, they send you to Anatolia with an important mission, and then you suddenly turn against them. How did this happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

Such discussions with powerful leaders like [[Mustafa Kemals early political and military career | Mustafa Kemal]] would likely be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. It is often observed that such figures, possessing a strong will, tend to control their narrative and do not allow it to be easily challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemals ability to selfcraft his narrative | They build their own story and do not leave it to chance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

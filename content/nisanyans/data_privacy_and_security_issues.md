A significant data breach involving Turkish e-government data has recently come to light, raising concerns about privacy and the handling of personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## E-Government Data Breach
E-government data belonging to 85 million people was reportedly stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This data, initially stolen, was subsequently published and shared with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The database in question has been available on the market since February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Scope of the Breach
The database contains records of approximately 100 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Of these:
*   Around 97 million are citizens of the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This relates to [[demographics_and_population_changes | population data]].
*   Approximately 3 million are foreigners residing in Türkiye, including individuals without a Turkish ID number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This also touches upon [[migration_and_integration_challenges | migration and integration challenges]] and [[demographics_and_population_changes | population changes]].
*   The records include birth dates, with some dating back to the 1780s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Roughly 5 million names in the database belong to individuals who are deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The speaker highlights the alarming nature of this event, questioning why such extensive personal information collected by the state becomes its property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This incident is an example of the [[impact_of_technology_on_privacy_and_state_surveillance | impact of technology on privacy and state surveillance]].

## Academic Perspective on Data
Despite the terrifying implications of the data breach, the speaker suggests that this vast [[impact_of_technology_on_privacy_and_state_surveillance | source of information]] should be utilized by social science researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. It could provide insights to understand Türkiye's "first face" and expand horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. However, there's a perceived disinterest in information and truth within the academic world, where "bureaucratic wars" often take precedence over valuable data not serving those interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

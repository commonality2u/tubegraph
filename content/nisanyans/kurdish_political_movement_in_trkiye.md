The Kurdish political movement in T端rkiye is analyzed in the context of recent elections, highlighting its distinct social and political characteristics, challenges, and future prospects.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview
Electoral maps of T端rkiye often depict a significant "big block in the southeast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>, distinct from western regions like Izmir and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This southeastern area, including Tunceli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a> and referred to as "Kurdistan like a huge continent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>, is described as a "strictly oppositionist" geography with an "ethnic cultural alien texture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. The population in this region is homogenously over 80% Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>, proud of their Kurdish identity, speaking Kurdish, and considering themselves Kurdish, "in no way Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. This region possesses a separate history, culture, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

## Historical Context and Political Unity
Historically, the "Kurdish problem" has been a recognized agenda item for Turkish governments, with past suggestions for its resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. While T端rkiye and this region have coexisted for a long time, concerns are raised about the long-term maintenance of T端rkiye's [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | political unity]] in an era of intense polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. The current climate features "two magnetic ends that repel each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>, making continued political unity uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP)
The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is presented as representing Kurdish nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Following developments in Syria, the HDP is seen as having entered the orbit of the US and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. This alignment is considered a political mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, as reliance on external powers can lead to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

In recent elections, the HDP, or the party established in its place with a "ridiculous name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, performed poorly and was "completely defeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Even Kurdish youth did not vote for the HDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. This poor performance suggests the party will not have a future without radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. A specific strategic mistake mentioned was taking the Turkish Workers' Party as a backup within an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

## Future of the Kurdish Political Movement
Despite the HDP's defeat, the Kurdish political movement is not expected to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. Instead, it is anticipated to be re-established within a new formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. This new political entity should focus directly and solely on defending the national interests of the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a> and highlighting their struggle for democracy and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Many current HDP cadres are expected to join this new formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The speaker shared two film recommendations, noting they were watched in the past week and found "very beautiful" and "very striking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## As Bestas (The Beasts)

This film, also known as "Animals" by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, is described as a "very dark movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It is primarily in the language of mountain villages in northwestern Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The speaker loved it and was "very impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, though his wife did not like it, questioning why she was made to watch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A key characteristic of *As Bestas* is its lack of a clear moral lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The protagonist, despite being wrong and knowing it, is someone the audience is meant to applaud and identify with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This creates a "different level of tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Mandarins

This film was made in cooperation between Estonian and Georgian filmmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Unlike *As Bestas*, it is portrayed as another "very beautiful movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[00:02:48]</a> that is well-acted, humorous, deep, and serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It possesses "very high dramatic tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[00:02:57]</a> and, importantly, "has a moral lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The film tells how "bad war is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While the speaker's wife "liked it a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, the speaker personally did not feel it had the same "striking power" as *As Bestas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Access to Films

The speaker noted that *As Bestas* (referred to as "Bilo") can be watched from "illegal sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The embracing of the [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] flag by institutional structures has prompted questions regarding the underlying reasons for this insistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This includes inquiries into the logic behind such "absurd" and "stubborn" actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Display of the LGBT Flag

In certain countries, including the United States, Canada, and England, the [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] flag has been displayed alongside national flags for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
A notable example occurred at the White House, where three giant [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] flags were hung beneath the main flag, superior to two United States flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This action is considered a crime under United States law, which mandates that the American flag must always be positioned on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
Additionally, giant [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] flags have been displayed at all American representations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. These displays have often been accompanied by "extremely serious ceremonies," including salutes from military units and police forces, akin to "homeland and nation ceremonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Political and Societal Interpretation

The speaker views these actions as part of a movement perceived to be an "enemy of societies and humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. An analogy is drawn to past discussions in Turkey regarding authorities insisting on defending "clearly lies on absurd issues," such as historical claims about Hittites or denials of the Armenian Genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Loyalty Test

The insistence on promoting things that are "empirically easy to falsify lies" is explained as a "loyalty test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
> The individual who accepts and reiterates these obvious falsehoods demonstrates unconditional loyalty to authority, rather than to truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This mechanism ensures that subordinates will obey "absurd orders" without rational basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The display of the [[lgbt_and_societal_norms | LGBT]] flag on embassies is interpreted as such a "test of loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

This test serves to identify individuals within the state organization and among citizens who are "one hundred percent loyal to authority" and will submit without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The intention is to gauge who will comply with future, potentially more serious, decisions, such as initiating a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This aligns with a broader concern about the end of democratic rule in the United States and the rise of an "openly authoritarian and extremely dangerous ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

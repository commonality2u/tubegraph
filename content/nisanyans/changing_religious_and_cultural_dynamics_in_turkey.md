## Shifting Religious Observance and Belief
There is an observable trend where some of the most conservative and religious individuals are openly criticizing Islam and its inherent contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. This phenomenon has prompted questions about whether Islam might undergo a transformation akin to Protestantism in Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. Christian Protestantism is viewed as a Salafist movement, an attempt to revert to the original state of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. In this context, Salafism within Islam is suggested as its form of "Protestantism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.

A sociological perspective suggests that the imposition of religious values, particularly over the last two decades, where the beliefs of a segment of society were forced upon the entire populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a> and private habits were harassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, naturally leads to a weakening of the religion itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | sociological change]], characterized by shifts in lifestyles, inevitably loosens religious ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Faith is a byproduct of religious practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>; when society moves away from Islamic customs and practices, individuals may question their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

While societies have an intrinsic need for religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>, both Christianity and Islam seem to be struggling to adapt to contemporary realities and may risk losing influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

## Defining Turkish Identity: "Türkiyeli"
The term "Türkiyeli" (a native of Turkey) has been a subject of debate in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. The Turkish Language Association initially added it to its dictionary but removed it due to public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. A dictionary's role is to reflect language as it is used, not to dictate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

"Türkiyeli" carries political connotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. It refers to someone who is a citizen of Turkey, or was born there and belongs to one or all of the cultures established in the country, regardless of whether they identify as a Turk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. This category differs from "Turk," overlapping in many cases but also including individuals who do not define themselves as Turks, such as [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Armenians]], Greeks, or Jews born in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. It also extends to millions abroad who maintain strong ties to Turkey's culture despite not being citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. Language naturally creates words to fill conceptual needs, and "Türkiyeli" serves as a distinct concept from "Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

## Historical and Contemporary Anti-Arab Sentiment
Hostility towards Arabs in Turkey dates back to the mid-19th century, emerging with the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. At its core, this sentiment reflects a desire by Ottomans, and later Turks, to identify with the West and assert their respectability to Westerners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. A common method was to differentiate themselves from Arabs, portraying Arabs as "insects" or "filth," while presenting Turks as lighter-skinned, Western-dressing, and cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:23:36]</a>.

This idea took root in the 1830s-1840s when the Ottoman State established a centralized bureaucracy, sending Istanbul-educated officers to administer provinces like Yemen, Basra, and Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:24:34]</a>. These officers, for the first time in centuries, directly encountered local populations, and many developed an automatic hatred for Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. Memoirs from this period often symbolize this cultural divide. For instance, during the Yemen war in the 1910s, Turkish officers like Ahmet Izzet Pasha, despite fighting the British, culturally aligned more with them, listening to Western classical music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:27:07]</a>. This attitude conveyed: "we are with the British, not Arabs; we don't like their culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:29]</a>.

Today, the intense hostility towards Syrians, which has erupted like a "sewer explosion," is rooted in this same complex: "we are not them; they are inferior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:58]</a>. This deep-seated [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | racism]] informs current sentiments.

## Black Sea Regional Identities
In the western half of Rize, including Kalkandere, nearly all village names are Greek in origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:14]</a>. There's no evidence of mass migration of foreigners settling in the Black Sea region since at least the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:48]</a>. While there were migrations within the Eastern Black Sea, and Greek miner villages were established due to the profitability of mining in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:33:21]</a>, no other significant population movements are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

The overwhelming majority of people in the western Black Sea region were historically Greeks, or individuals of Greek identity who spoke Greek and practiced Orthodox Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:57]</a>. They gradually converted to Islam from the 16th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:34:02]</a>. Over generations, Greek was replaced by Turkish in schools, and children learned Turkish from peers, leading to a shift in language use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:26]</a>.

Since the early 20th century, due to ideological and psychological disapproval of a Greek past in Turkey, people often construct narratives about their family origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:57]</a>. A person's family origin is a sensitive subject, as it can affect their social standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:36:09]</a>. This sensitivity leads to people telling consistent "lies" about their ancestry, which they eventually come to believe themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:56]</a>. For example, denying a Greek past and inventing a story about ancestors coming from Maraş generations ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:17]</a>. This highlights the complex [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics of ethnic groups in Turkey]] and the construction of [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural identity]].

This article discusses the nature of controversy surrounding historical figures and events, often stemming from challenges to established narratives or the re-evaluation of historical claims.

## Past "Lynching Campaigns" Faced by the Speaker

The speaker recounts several instances of being subjected to national-scale "lynching campaigns" due to his statements on various topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. He suggests he holds an "ambitious position in the world leagues" for the frequency of such campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### The Black Sea Travel Guide Incident (2000)
In 2000, a campaign erupted following the publication of the speaker's Black Sea travel guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Specific sentences in the book caused widespread outrage across local and national media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The controversial points included:
*   **Bayburt likened to Afghanistan**: The speaker described Bayburt as a place where women and girls ran away upon seeing a car, resembling Afghanistan, which he considers an accurate simile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. He views Afghanistan as one of his biggest travel dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Reference to Topal Osman**: While discussing Giresun, the speaker mentioned the Topal Osman Monument and associated Topal Osman with [[allegations_against_mustafa_kemal_during_world_war_i | Abdullah Çatlı]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. He states he knows the love and admiration with which Çatlı's friends speak of him, despite not liking Çatlı's ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **"Natashas" in Trabzon and Rize**: The speaker noted the prevalence of "Natashas" (referring to women from former Soviet republics involved in sex work) in the region, stating that the main sector of the region had become "the work sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. He described a hotel lobby filled with such women who were "completely harmless," suggesting it's "a likeable hotel, Natasha is doing her job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
    *   The speaker clarifies that the outrage stemmed from an assumption that these statements were insults, whereas his intent contained irony and a "distant view," challenging stereotypical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

### Statements on Freedom of Speech and Religious Figures (2009 & 2012)
*   **Allah and the Prophet**: In 2009, the speaker faced a campaign for questioning the limits of freedom of speech regarding Allah and the prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He asserts he has "never insulted Allah or the prophet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. His stance was to express the opinion that restricting freedom of expression by claiming insult to Allah or the prophet is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Personality of Prophet Muhammad**: In 2012, he was "lynched" for making statements regarding the historical personality of Prophet Muhammad, implying that Prophet Muhammad could be viewed "in a negative light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

### Comment on a Psychologist and Client (unspecified date)
The speaker faced a "wild lynching campaign" for asking whether the consequences of a personal lynching, in a case of sexual intimacy between a psychologist and client, were morally defensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. He noted that the public overwhelmingly defended the psychologist, advocating for severe punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

### Elazığ Earthquake Incident (unspecified date)
After the Elazığ earthquake, the speaker asked whether one would approve of the death of a city's population, which he characterized as "190% fascist and bigoted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. His answer was that he didn't care about the men, but children are innocent and should be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. He views this as the morally correct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

## Controversial Claims About Mustafa Kemal Atatürk

The speaker's recent controversial statements center around Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's private life and historical actions. He views interest in Atatürk's private life as inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>, but states that the main issue is the event itself being "wrong" even without direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>.

### Atatürk's Daughters and Abdurrahim
*   **Spiritual/Adopted Daughters**: The speaker discussed the "rumor that he had a mistress relationship" with his adopted daughters, noting it as "gossip known by everyone throughout Atatürk's entire life" and mentioned in foreign memoirs and press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. He asked if it was morally and legally right for an adult, single man to adopt adolescent girls and keep them in his private apartment, stating that the very creation of such gossip was a "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.
*   **Abdurrahim**: The topic of Abdurrahim, an orphaned child adopted by Atatürk in Van in 1916, was brought up as a defense mechanism when the issue of Atatürk's daughters "got out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. Abdurrahim stayed with Atatürk through various fronts and in his residence until he was sent away to Izmir just before Atatürk married Latife Hanım in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. He later returned to Atatürk's mansion after the divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>. The speaker highlights this as a "strange story" and questions why Abdurrahim was sent away upon marriage, pointing out that Abdurrahim's existence as Atatürk's "adopted son" was a "big taboo" until 10-15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>.

### Nazım Hikmet's Characterization of Atatürk
The speaker refers to Nazım Hikmet's poem about "Tahsim Bey," which he believes to be the "most magnificent evaluation" of Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. The poem describes a "victorious and magnificent Gambler," "sarcastic, quarrelsome, cunning and dominating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>. The speaker states that Atatürk "betrayed everyone who was close to him, everyone without exception," including early friends, political allies (Fethi Okyar, Rauf Orbay, Kazım Karabekir, Cavit Bey, Enver, Nurettin Pasha, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, İsmet İnönü), and lovers (Fikriye Vedat, Latife Hanım), describing this as a "sociopathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>.

### Justification of Atatürk's Actions
The speaker argues that Atatürk's actions, such as rebuilding a ruined state and protecting his own power, led to a "logical sequence" of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>. These include:
*   Creating "national excitement" in a collapsed economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>.
*   "Painting the eyes of the ordinary citizen with stories of homeland, nation, Sakarya and infidels pouring into the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.
*   Hanging "a few" comrades-in-arms to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.
*   Taking "deterrent measures against the Kurds" to prevent state disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:00">[38:14:00]</a>.
*   Striking a middle ground between "British liberalism and German Nazism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.
*   Tearing a piece from Syria when France appeared weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:00">[38:53:00]</a>.
The speaker asserts that these actions were inevitable for anyone in Atatürk's position given the historical dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>, and that the real problem is not with Atatürk himself but with his "disciples" and the "Kemalism disease" which fosters a "moral blindness" that justifies state actions and leads to "contemporary Turkish racism and state worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:29:00">[43:29:00]</a>. This "pathology specific to Türkiye" is seen as a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:00">[41:34:00]</a>, and a representation of "the arrogance of the nation" which prevents understanding other peoples and modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>.

### Allegations of British Influence on Atatürk
The speaker discusses [[allegations_against_mustafa_kemal_during_world_war_i | Mustafa Kemal]]'s relationship with the British, particularly regarding similarities between Atatürk and Riza Shah Pahlavi in their modernization programs and rise to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. He suggests that the loss of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria in the last 40 days of World War I was a "staged fight" and the result of an agreement where the British accepted withdrawal to Turkish and Kurdish-inhabited borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. He highlights that Atatürk, who was in Vienna possibly meeting the British king's brother, immediately returned to Istanbul upon the Sultan's death, was accepted by Vahdettin, and appointed Commander of the Palestine front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. Atatürk's first act was to dismiss German Chiefs of Staff and commanders, leading to a quick British victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. After returning to Istanbul, he maintained close relations with the director of British intelligence in the Ottoman Empire until he left for Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>. The British policy aimed to eliminate Enver, keep France out of the game, and prevent Russian influence in Türkiye, supporting a "modern Turkish state that has good relations with the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a>.

## Other Historical Figures and Power Dynamics

The speaker discusses the nature of power and its effects on individuals, especially in the context of sexuality.
*   **Sexual behavior of powerful men**: He states that "the desire for social power and the desire for sexual power go hand in hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Men with "unlimited power" tend to push limits and pursue a "dream of a harem," desiring to interact with "as many women, women and men" as possible, including "underage women and men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. This behavior is attributed to the removal of social and legal "brakes" once a person gains absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.
*   **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan**: The speaker acknowledges Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a "counter-evidence" to this theory, noting that despite 21 years at the top of power, no "mischief" regarding his private life has been reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. He calls this an "interesting thing" and a "difficult thing" to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
*   **Historical examples of power and behavior**: He references figures like Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, Assad, Caesar, and Keyhusrev, noting that those who challenge the US often face severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

## Germany and Geopolitics
The speaker criticizes the German ruling classes for their stance in the Ukraine War and Gaza War, seeing it as "licking the appropriate places of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a>. He observes that German industry has collapsed, and the Nord Stream pipeline, crucial for Germany's energy and relationship with Russia, was destroyed by the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:00">[53:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47:00">[53:47:00]</a>.

He explains this seemingly "stupid" behavior by suggesting it's a calculated response to US pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. Since Germany's reunification in 1990, the US has seen a potential German-Russian alliance as a threat to its own existence, leading to policies aimed at disrupting this relationship, culminating in the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:53:00">[56:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:21:00">[1:00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:38:00">[1:00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:59:00">[1:00:59:00]</a>. The US "pointed a gun at their heads," forcing Germany to choose sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:29:00">[1:01:29:00]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | Impact of Historical Events on Current Geopolitics]].

## Ottoman Acceptance of Western Moral Superiority
The speaker states that the educated Ottoman classes, especially those aware of France, "unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West" during the Tanzimat period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:21:00">[1:04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:50:00">[1:04:50:00]</a>. This wasn't about abandoning Islamic morality but recognizing Western superiority in areas like honesty, education, respect for women, clean cities, and advancements in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:14:00">[1:05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:21:00">[1:05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:31:00">[1:05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:34:00">[1:05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:50:00">[1:05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Women's Rights**: Women's rights were a crucial aspect, with progressive Ottoman intellectuals advocating for women's education to modernize society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:20:00">[1:07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:28:00">[1:07:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:40:00">[1:08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:52:00">[1:08:52:00]</a>. This led to the establishment of the first state girls' high school in France and the Girls' Teachers' School (Darül muallimat) in the Ottoman Empire in 1880, along with the later acceptance of female students to universities and the proliferation of women's magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:15:00">[1:09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:41:00">[1:09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:56:00">[1:09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:19:00">[1:10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Class Relations**: The concept of class was weak in Ottoman culture until the 20th century, particularly after the Soviet Revolution, when discussions around the rights of the proletarian and peasant classes gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:51:00">[1:07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:31:00">[1:08:31:00]</a>.

## Racism and National Identity
The speaker notes that racism, including Turkish racism, often involves self-perception of virtue while being immoral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:32:31:00">[1:32:31:00]</a>. He compares it to Greek racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:10:00">[1:33:10:00]</a>. The policy of assimilating Kurds through Turkish citizenship and education has "failed" and resulted in a "terrible defeat" for the Turks, particularly since the 1980s when Kurds began attending university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:33:00">[1:33:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:50:00">[1:33:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:34:17:00">[1:34:17:00]</a>. He predicts that the Kurdish side will eventually achieve victory by integrating into and taking over the system from within, leading to a new balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:35:57:00">[1:35:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:36:07:00">[1:36:07:00]</a>.

## The Role of Religion and God
The speaker contemplates whether religion can exist without a god and if the threat of invisible beings is necessary for people to follow rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:11:00">[1:17:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:23:00">[1:17:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:05:00">[1:19:05:00]</a>. He believes religion is a serious "social need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:36:00">[1:17:36:00]</a>, but that the traditional idea of an omnipotent God is no longer defensible for the "wise part of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:48:00">[1:17:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:19:00">[1:18:19:00]</a>. He questions how to reconcile these facts, given his belief that societies cannot live without religion, yet existing religions are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:35:00">[1:18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:41:00">[1:18:41:00]</a>. He suggests the "myth of god" is kept alive more by the feeling of being seen, loved, and understood than by the threat of punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:20:00">[1:19:20:00]</a>.

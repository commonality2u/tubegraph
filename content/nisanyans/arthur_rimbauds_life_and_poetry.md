Arthur Rimbaud, a French poet, is highlighted as a personal hero by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He passed away on November 10, 1891, at the young age of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Poetic Contributions

Rimbaud's first poems were written when he was just 16 or 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. His poem, "Le Bateau ivre" (The Drunken Boat), is considered one of the most extraordinary poems of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It exhibits a striking, completely new, crazy, and surreal sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. What makes his work unique is how he placed this wild sensitivity onto an extremely solid classical poetry discipline, which is described as a dizzying event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The poem "Le Bateau ivre" can be interpreted as the point where the blind adventurism, a defining feature of [[cultural_and_historical_observations_on_france_and_europe | European culture]], rejects ties and desires to conquer the world, breaking like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This breaking point, like a "Rodin" breaking 20 or 30 years later, moved towards World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The poem contains a giant, incredible, and ultimately unsustainable vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It functions as both a victory cry of [[cultural_and_historical_observations_on_france_and_europe | European civilization]] and an elegy of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Later Life and Travels

Rimbaud spent much of his life as a vagabond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He was described as a homosexual drug addict vagabond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. At some point, he decided this life no longer satisfied him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, so he settled in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. After Yemen, he migrated to the city of Harar in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, where he became involved in the coffee and arms trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He began these ventures around the age of 25 or 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

During a past trip to Ethiopia, the speaker wished to visit Arthur Rimbaud's house in Harar but did not have the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Harar itself is a city of interest due to its distinct [[cultural_and_historical_observations_on_france_and_europe | culture]] and past compared to the rest of Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Historically, it is said that the old native ruling class of Harar was of Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This stems from a historical detail that during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (specifically around 1535), Turkish soldiers sent to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to fight the Portuguese were defeated, lost their ships, and eventually settled in Harar under the protection of its Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

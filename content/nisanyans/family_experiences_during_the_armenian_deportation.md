The family's experience with the [[Armenian Genocide | Deportation]] period was a subject rarely discussed within the family, though information was later learned from both the mother's and father's sides, both of whom were from Istanbul for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Deportation in Istanbul

Unlike other regions, the [[Armenian Genocide | Deportation]] was not generally implemented in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The most significant incident in Istanbul occurred on April 24, 1915, as the initial move of the [[Armenian Genocide | Deportation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Approximately 150-240 people were arrested and sent to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The vast majority of those sent, except for three to five individuals, were never heard from again and were presumed killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Grandfather's Experience

The grandfather on the father's side was a writer and [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house owner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Though not among the most prominent, he was a notable personality in Istanbul's cultural and intellectual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He was one of 24 people arrested during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. After being held for a period, he was released, though the reasons for his release remain unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Additionally, one of the individuals exiled at that time hid in the grandfather's house for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The family continued their existence in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## 1922 Migration to France

In 1922, after the fall of Izmir, panic spread in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This led to France allowing, for the first time, a mass [[armenian_migration_from_istanbul_to_france_post1922 | migration of Armenians from Istanbul to France]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This mass migration of Istanbul Armenians to France occurred in 1922, not in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. In the months immediately following Izmir's capture by the Turks in September 1922, many packed onto ships and departed in great panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The family, including the father's family, grandmother, and siblings, also traveled to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Return to Istanbul

After residing in Paris for two to three years, the grandfather chose to return to Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He returned to revive his old [[publishing_and_literary_contributions_of_armenian_families_in_istanbul | publishing house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Near Beyazıt Square, where the Faculty of Letters and Faculty of Chemistry of the current university are located, he opened bookstores and second-hand bookseller shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For years until the 1950s, these became some of the most well-known and beloved bookstores in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Impact on Education

The year 1915 saw the closure of all [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools in Istanbul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. As a result, the grandmother, who was around fifteen years old and in middle school at the time, had her schooling disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. She subsequently attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years, as her original Emir School was closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This allowed her to learn and pass French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. She also knew Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools]] were reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

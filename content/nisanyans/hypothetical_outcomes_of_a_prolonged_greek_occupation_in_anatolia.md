This article explores the hypothetical scenarios if the Greek military campaign in Anatolia (1919-1922) had achieved a more decisive victory, particularly if the [[potential_geopolitical_shifts_in_europe_with_a_greek_victory | Greek army had captured Ankara]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Greek Objectives vs. Deeper Penetration

The initial international understanding promised Greece only the province of Izmir and the district of Ayval覺k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Greece's landing in Izmir and Ayval覺k on May 16, 1919, was conceived as a "police operation" by the Paris Peace Conference to maintain public order in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> and provide a safe haven for Greek refugees deported from the Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. At this stage, the Greeks did not raise their own flags in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The major powers, including the British, French, Italians, and Americans, did not suggest a permanent annexation of Anatolia at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] (1920) envisioned Izmir and Ayval覺k as a security area for the Greeks until a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It stipulated a five-year occupation of these areas, followed by a referendum, which implied their eventual transfer to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, the [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] was described as a "stillborn" bargaining and threatening document, never fully signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

The expanded Greek military operations in 1920 and 1921, which saw the Greek Army push beyond Izmir to invade Nazilli, Bursa, and Ayd覺n, and even reach the Sakarya River with the aim of capturing Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, were not intended for the annexation of all Western Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Instead, their objective was to compel the Ankara government to surrender, negotiate, or accept the [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It was fundamentally a punitive and intimidating operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory

If the Greek campaign had succeeded in capturing Ankara and scattering its army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, leading to the withdrawal of Mustafa Kemal and his associates as political players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, several developments might have occurred:

### Reshaping International Agreements
*   A London Conference would likely have been convened to reformulate the [[consequences_of_treaty_of_sevres_on_greekturkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] based on the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   Given a victorious Greece, Izmir and its province, or at least the Aegean coast, would have been definitively ceded to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   A consortium or collective management, possibly involving Greeks, would have been established in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Geopolitical Shifts
*   The victory would have significantly amplified British diplomatic dominance in the region, especially concerning Turkey, as the relationship between France and England had already strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   This British dominance would have led to an "endless and bottomless conflict" between France and England, with Italy aligning with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Turkish Response to Occupation
Even with a military defeat, the Turkish population constituted the overwhelming majority of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Additionally, Turkey possessed a highly developed administrative class, including officers, military and civil academy graduates, governors, ministers, journalists, and professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This elite would not have remained passive but would have engaged in a struggle to regain control through economic, social, political, propaganda, and organizational means if a military victory was not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The British management style would likely involve balancing Greek and Turkish interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Long-Term Consequences: Shifting Alliances
A "new Turkey" established under British rule, similar to Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, or Austria at the time, would likely have joined the "avengers' camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, feeling unjustly treated after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When the opportunity arose around 1938-1939, such a Turkey would have likely allied with Germany, potentially altering the entire history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Analysis of Military and Economic Realities

At the time, the Greek army and the re-established Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) army in 1922 were roughly comparable in terms of soldier numbers (around 190,000-200,000 mutually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. However, key demographic and economic factors favored Turkey:
*   Turkey's population was 4 to 5 times that of Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   Turkey's economy was at least 3 times larger than Greece's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Turkey had a centuries-old war and weapon tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   The political population in the Aegean Region was overwhelmingly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

These factors meant that a prolonged war, lasting longer than one or two years, could not be won by Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The only chance for the Greek army was a swift, decisive victory, supported by strong British financial, weapons, and equipment aid, before the Ankara government could organize its defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. After the war became stagnant, particularly after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece had no chance of overall victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This reality was known by the British, French, and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Recent events have led to a significant shift in the [[political_situation_and_predictions_in_the_usa | political situation in the USA]], with President Biden withdrawing his candidacy for President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This decision was largely anticipated, with the speaker noting that it was "given spontaneously in the last half hour or an hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

## Reasons for Withdrawal
It became "obvious" that Biden would withdraw after his debate with [[political_analysis_of_trump_assassination_attempt_and_american_politics | Trump]], where the "big guns of the Democratic Party" seemingly realized he was a "fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. The speaker highlights that symptoms of Alzheimer's were "pretty obvious" even when he was elected in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

## Succession and Strategy
The delay in his withdrawal, despite clear signs, suggests that "they are somehow making their calculations through Kamala Harris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. While it is considered "very hard" for Kamala Harris to win the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>, she is seen as the "exact President they want" because she lacks "political basis, no power, no team, no gang, no personality, no principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. The expectation is that she will be brought into power "somehow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

## Future Political Landscape
The speaker predicts that Kamala Harris will be at the forefront as a "very important figure in world politics" for the next "8 10 10 12 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. This assessment underscores the potential for a new era in American politics following Biden's departure.

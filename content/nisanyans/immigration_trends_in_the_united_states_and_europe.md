Recent global trends indicate significant shifts in [[demographics_and_population_changes | population dynamics]] due to changing immigration patterns in Western countries, particularly the United States and Europe. These trends are having profound [[significance_of_immigration_in_western_countries | societal]] and [[immigration_and_societal_challenges_in_western_countries | political impacts]].

## United States
In 2023, for the first time in its history, the United States experienced a phenomenon where the number of individuals [[demographics_and_population_changes | immigrating]] to the country exceeded the number of people born there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This influx of new population includes a significant proportion of individuals entering almost entirely illegally by easily crossing the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This represents a [[migration_and_integration_challenges | transformation]] rarely observed in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

While the current political system of the United States does not currently permit a similar profound [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | transformation]] compared to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, [[migration_and_integration_challenges | social tensions]] and stress have reached unbearable levels, suggesting an inevitable eventual explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Europe
A similar situation of [[migration_and_integration_challenges | migration]] is unfolding across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These countries are experiencing a "flood" of people from poorer nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This demographic shift is anticipated to have significant and rapidly developing [[controversial_political_events_in_the_us_and_europe | political consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Political and Societal Impacts in Europe
The increasing [[demographics_and_population_changes | immigration]] is expected to lead to:
*   **Rise of the Far-Right**: It appears inevitable that so-called "extreme right" parties will gain power in various European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These parties are largely anti-immigrant, focusing their agenda on defending indigenous culture against newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Anti-European Union Sentiment**: These political parties and movements also oppose the European Union project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. While the European Union may not dissolve or face widespread withdrawals, its previous trajectory of progressively absorbing national sovereignty over the past two decades is deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The EU's expansion projects are also considered unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Assimilation Policies
Historically, policies aimed at [[cultural_assimilation_issues_in_europe | language assimilation]] were prevalent in countries across the geography, including Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Türkiye, and Armenia throughout the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>. Such policies, where non-native speakers faced harassment and expulsion for not speaking the national language, were fundamental aspects of early Republic-era Türkiye until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. The fate of Syrian immigrants in Turkey is pondered, with the suggestion that they might face similar assimilation pressures unless the Turkish state actively integrates them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

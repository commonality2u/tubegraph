This article summarizes observations and analyses regarding the [[electoral_outcomes_and_their_impact_on_Turkey | Turkish elections]], focusing on the reasons behind the results, critiques of political actors, and future outlooks.

## Election Outcome and Public Expectation

The nation watched the election results with great excitement, with many friends and acquaintances convinced that the government would change, even preparing champagne for May 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this expectation was not met, leading to widespread disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The speaker had consistently stated that the election could not be won by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, having shared a prediction two weeks prior that the probability of Kılıçdaroğlu winning and coming to power was only one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Reasons for the Election Result

The speaker bases their predictions on several logical reasons, not on special information about the hearts or minds of the 86 million people in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Concentration of Power
Since the 1930s, there has been a concentration of power in Türkiye, making it difficult for the government to give up easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The opposition lacks a comparable force to challenge this entrenched power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Lack of Strong Political Leadership
The speaker argues that there is no "great social excitement" or "social emotion explosion" that would create a powerful element for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. They state there is no political leadership or alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The chosen candidate, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, is described as "probably the most incompetent and most doomed to defeat person in the history of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He has reportedly entered and lost about ten elections, consistently failing to increase his vote share beyond 24-25 percent, even after including three other parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Disconnect of "White Turks"
The "educated classes of Türkiye," often called "White Turks," are criticized for their inability to understand societal dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. They are seen as incredibly bigoted, failing to comprehend why a large segment of society supports Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or finds their own discourse ridiculous and disgusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. They declare themselves democrats while labeling others as ignorant or stupid, believing people "sold their souls for a sack of coal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This group, according to the speaker, represents nothing, promises no dynamism, and lacks appeal, hoping for a retired civil servant with a "Western image" and watered-down Atatürkism to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Critique of the Current Government

The speaker believes that while the current government is inadequate and has made significant mistakes, such as abandoning promises regarding justice, the Kurdish issue, Cyprus, and Armenia, and engaging in the "terrible fiasco" of entering Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, it is difficult to imagine who could do better under current conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. They argue that many things are done with money, and the era of "floating money" from the West that benefited Türkiye until 2008-2009 is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Reasons for Erdoğan's Tenure to End

Despite the challenges of finding an alternative, the speaker believes Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's "expiration date has passed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> for three main reasons:

1.  **Arbitrary Administration and Injustice**: A system has emerged where justice is completely shaken, evidenced by the imprisonment of figures like Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtaş, thousands of lawsuits for insulting the president, and the non-implementation of court decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
2.  **Excessive Accumulation of Power**: Twenty years in power has led to an "excessive accumulation of power," resulting in an "unlimited and uncontrolled and unbalanced authority" given to one person, inevitably causing "a great poisoning of power," uncontrolled administration, and arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. State power is a dangerous weapon, and humanity tends to misuse great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
3.  **Hate Speech and Societal Polarization**: Erdoğan has adopted hate speech as the basis of his politics, constantly pumping hatred and anger into society for years, leading to all segments of society "going mad with hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This situation is considered a shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Future Scenarios for Leadership Change

The speaker does not believe Erdoğan's departure can happen through elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, wishing for a serious and hopeful opponent to emerge who could inspire masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. They argue the system is set up to prevent such a person from emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

Overthrowing Erdoğan by ideologically and politically hostile forces would have "terrible consequences," opening up a future of uncontrollable revenge due to "too many injustices" committed over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This includes constitutional violations, economic corruption, drug trafficking, money laundering, victimization by statutory decrees, and actions in Kurdish provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

The speaker proposes two main scenarios for a change in leadership:
1.  **Erdoğan leaves on his own**: This is seen as a less likely scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
2.  **Controlled Removal from Within**: The speaker believes the second strongest possibility is that Erdoğan is removed from power in a controlled and decent manner by someone within his own staff, within an "apparently legal environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This is given a 12.5% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
3.  **Continued Status Quo**: The speaker assigns a 75% probability to the regime continuing exactly as it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Critique of the Opposition's Strategy

The public expectation for a first-round victory by Kılıçdaroğlu, fueled by the "We are winning" campaign, was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. This campaign led to severe disappointment and demotivation among voters, making them hesitant to participate in a potential second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

The guest, Kaan Göktaş, expresses confusion about the election results, especially the 5% vote for Sinan Oğan, which he found "incredibly big" given his lack of proper campaigning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

On claims of election manipulation, the speaker argues that if results are manipulated, then elections are not the solution to the regime problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. They criticize the opposition for participating in what they imply is a "theater," rather than boycotting or protesting illegality from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. While the speaker doesn't fully agree that the opposition is just a "patchwork coalition" to give an image of opposition, he believes a significant group within CHP is sincerely trying to take power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The discussion also touches on the inability of the multi-party opposition coalition (including HDP, a fascist party, Ali Babacan, and Islamists) to realistically implement any coherent project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[01:00:00]</a>. Their plan, as understood by the speaker, was to weaken Erdoğan, create chaos in parliament, and force an early election where they could then share power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Analysis of Electoral Map and Societal Divisions

The election maps reveal a "three-color map" of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>:
1.  The middle part of the country is completely yellow (likely indicating the ruling party's strong support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
2.  A thin strip in the west, from Istanbul to Muğla, is another color (representing the more secular/Western-oriented opposition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
3.  A large block in the southeast (Kurdistan) is a third color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.

The speaker notes that there is "no consistency" or "connection" between the Western and Southeastern blocks, calling their political alliance "extremely superficial" with different social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. They believe that a geography that is "strictly oppositionist" at around 80% and has an "ethnic cultural alien texture" (referring to the Kurdish region) cannot maintain political unity with Türkiye in the long term, especially in a state of polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Performance of Specific Parties

*   **HDP (Kurdish Political Movement)**: The HDP, described as representing Kurdish nationalism, is criticized for entering the orbit of the US and EU, which is seen as a political mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. The party, or the new formation replacing it, must radically change and focus directly on Kurdish national interests and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Its alliance with the Turkish Workers' Party is considered a "terrible strategic mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **MHP**: The MHP had a "very successful performance" despite Devlet Bahçeli's "absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The speaker finds it surprising that the MHP, which was expected to melt to 5%, performed so strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This success is interpreted by some as nationalist voters giving MHP a role as a "watchman" of the regime and Turkishness within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.
*   **Good Party**: The Good Party is deemed a "fiasco" and the "loser of the election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Despite polls showing it above 13-14%, it received 9.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. Its decline is attributed to a historical lesson in [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | Turkish political history]]: right-wing parties that ally with the Republican People's Party (CHP) tend to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.
*   **Deva and Davutoğlu's Party**: Deva is seen as following a "proper line" but had support below 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Davutoğlu's party is dismissed as a "personal toy of a ridiculous man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

## Impact of Earthquake on Votes

The speaker states that the recent earthquake, contrary to social media predictions, "did not cause an earthquake in political preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. In affected provinces like Maraş, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan still won with high rates, such as 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The less educated classes did not blame Erdoğan for the disaster, understanding that earthquakes are natural phenomena and that human action in the face of such magnitude is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

## Internet Age and Democracy

The speaker believes that the internet age, far from increasing democracy, is causing a decrease in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Information bombardment decreases rational decision-making and fosters a herd mentality, where people blindly follow a chosen "pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. The internet, being under state control, also contributes to the "excessive strengthening of bureaucracies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

## The Role of Polls

The speaker argues that election polls have become "completely ridiculous" and "ineffective propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. They state that the polling industry, invented in the 1990s, has been learned and manipulated by political players, and the public has learned to lie in response to poll questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes the need for self-reflection after defeat, urging people to ask "What did I do wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. They characterize [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkish society]] as pragmatic and opportunistic rather than conservative, suggesting it will embrace an attractive alternative if offered one that makes them "feel good" about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. They conclude that the essential task is to keep an open mind, consider different perspectives and possibilities, and make more rational and skillful decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## The Disappearance of the Prussians and National Identity
The historical region of Prussia, located in the northeast of modern-day Poland, including Kaliningrad (Königsburg), was once home to a Baltic tribe known as the Prussians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. These people were characterized as primitive and tribal, speaking a language related to Lithuanian and Latvian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. They were the last European nation to convert to Christianity, resisting until the 1200s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

In the 1230s, the German organization known as the Teutonic Knights, dedicated to Christian jihad, took control of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. They carried out a severe 60-year massacre, forcing the local Prussian people to convert to Christianity or face death, burning their villages and destroying their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This campaign reduced the Prussians to an oppressed minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. To solidify control, Germans were invited to settle the area, leading to the [[The Role of Language in National Identity | Germanization]] of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

While the Prussian language was spoken among the people until the 17th and 18th centuries, even by priests for preaching, it eventually disappeared by the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The Prussian population largely assimilated, becoming servants, peasants, or intermarrying with Germans and Lithuanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This process led to the complete disappearance of the Prussian people as a distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. By the 19th century, Prussia was a German state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. After World War II, Germans from this region were deported to Germany, and the territory was divided among Poland, Russia (Kaliningrad), and Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Russia, as a result, has lost both its old Baltic Russian and German Russian pasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Turkish Politics: Westernization vs. Anti-Westernism
For 150 years, the central theme of [[History and Nationalism in Trkiye | Turkish politics]] has been [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Westernization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Turkish left]], traditionally stemming from the Westernist tradition, initially viewed itself as an extreme proponent of modernization and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. However, after joining NATO in the 1950s, the Turkish left wavered, struggling to reconcile its Western inclinations with the West's leadership by America and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This confusion, leading to unconvincing allegiances to the Soviet Union or Mao, contributed to their limited effectiveness in Turkish politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

In contrast, the Islamist movement in [[Nationalism and its impacts in Turkey | Turkey]], particularly in the 1950s and 60s, was vehemently anti-Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. This changed direction in the 1970s with Erbakan, as Turkish Islamism became a primary carrier of the anti-Western stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## Anti-Semitism and Religious-Political Structures
Anti-Semitism is not a universal instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Until the 20th century, anti-Semitism was notably absent in the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Historical records from the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Yemen do not indicate widespread serious anti-Jewish sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Jews in these regions found conditions "40 times better than Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

A sudden rise in anti-Semitism in the Islamic world emerged in the mid-20th century, particularly in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. This was largely due to the establishment of Israel and its policies against the local Arab population in Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. The conquest of an Islamic land by a people historically despised, supported by the West, was perceived as an intolerable humiliation, leading to violent anti-Semitism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

In Europe, by contrast, violent [[Historical roots and impacts of nationalism | anti-Semitism]] has existed since the Middle Ages, rising and falling but consistently present for over 10 centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. This difference is rooted in the distinct political structures of Islam and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>:
*   **Christianity and Homogeneity:** The Christian religion formed within the Roman Empire, a vast entity striving for cultural homogeneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. When Christianity became the state religion, the idea that a non-Christian could exist within this civilization was foreign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. Jews, by stubbornly refusing to join the common Christian platform, were always rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. By the 13th century, Europe was 99.8% Christian, and the remaining tiny non-Christian minority was seen as anomalous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Islam and Governance of Diversity:** Islam, starting as a minority movement, conquered a vast world where it was impossible to easily convert populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. In its brightest period, under the Abbasids, only a small percentage of ruled lands were Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. From the beginning, Islam developed rules and systems for living with and governing diverse, non-Muslim populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. While the Christian world aimed to erase non-Christians by integrating them, the Muslim world governed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. By the 13th century, 60% of the Islamic world's population was non-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This structural difference accounts for the varied historical experiences of Jews in Christian and Islamic societies.

## The Role of Language in National Survival: The Armenian Alphabet
The invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop in 405 AD, reportedly from the village of Güven (Hadsiz/Hadise) in Muş, was a pivotal moment in [[The Role of Language in National Identity | Armenian history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. Its primary purpose was to facilitate the translation of the Bible into Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.

This development was crucial because the Armenian Kingdom had suffered severe blows from Byzantium and Iran in the late 4th century, leading to its destruction and the end of its political existence by 428 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. Normally, nations facing such a fate are erased from history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

The creation of an Armenian script and religious literature allowed Armenians to continue as a distinct nation, resisting assimilation into either Zoroastrian Persian culture or Greek Christian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. It provided the means for the [[The Role of Language in National Identity | Armenian language]] to become the medium for their religious and cultural identity, enabling their survival as a political and cultural entity for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Assimilation in Muş
At the beginning of the 19th century, nearly all villages on the Muş plain were inhabited by Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>. There was also a significant Kurdish population, involved in animal husbandry and seasonal migration, with whom the Armenian villagers had various interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>. The city of Muş was predominantly Kurdish, ruled by the Muş Principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>. This principality, sometimes acting as an independent state, collected its own taxes and maintained a Kurdish Muslim and Yazidi army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. Armenian villages were obligated to quarter and feed these soldiers in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>.

In the 1830s, the Ottoman Empire centralized its administration, liquidating the Kurdish principalities, including Muş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. This upset the existing religious and tribal balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>. By the end of the 19th century, over half of the Muş plain's population was Muslim and Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>. A significant number of Armenians converted to Islam for social reasons, subsequently becoming Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. When they converted, their children could no longer attend Armenian schools, leading to them adopting Kurdish as the common language of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>. They also sought protection from various tribes, becoming attached to them and further assimilating into Kurdish identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. By the early 20th century, Armenians became a minority in Muş province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:59">[01:34:59]</a>, and by 1918, they had "disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>.

## Karaite Jews and Turkish Identity
The Karaites are a Jewish sect that formed a significant community in the Crimean Khanate until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>. Distinct from other Jews, they spoke Turkish, specifically a version of Crimean Tatar, because Turkish was the common language of Crimea in daily life and public affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>. Their home language was Turkish, infused with Jewish words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>.

Following Jewish pogroms in Russia at the end of the 19th century, the Karaite community dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>. Some assimilated into mainstream Jewish communities, while others migrated to Istanbul or America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>. In Istanbul, a section of the Hasköy Jewish cemetery is reserved for Karaite graves, often bearing inscriptions in Cyrillic, Russian, Hebrew, and Crimean Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>. The Karaite community in Istanbul rapidly declined, melting away and joining normal Jewish communities or migrating to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. Today, there is no longer a distinct Karaite community in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16">[01:39:16]</a>. A rumor exists that Istanbul's Karaköy neighborhood is named after the Karaites ("Kara Village"), but this is unconfirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

## Universal Human Instincts vs. Ideology
The speaker challenges the notion that mercy, humanism, or a sense of justice are exclusive products of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. He argues that compassion, helping the weak, social justice, and the idea that all people are equally human are universal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>. These sentiments exist across cultures and religions, from the Stone Age to ancient Greece, in Muslim and Buddhist societies, and are co-existent with humanity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>. The feeling of socialism, that society is obliged to protect its weak and vulnerable, is present wherever there are people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:53">[01:42:53]</a>.

Conversely, competition and a dynamic hierarchy where the strong oppress the weak are also inherent human characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. To define human nature by only one of these poles—either pure compassion or pure competition—is considered "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Both are fundamental human instincts: the social responsibility towards all individuals and the drive for self-preservation and family welfare, even if it means injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. These two opposing poles represent the unchangeable reality of human societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>. An imbalance in either direction leads to societal sickness, requiring correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:58">[01:45:58]</a>.

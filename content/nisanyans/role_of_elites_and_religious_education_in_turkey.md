Türkiye faces a significant challenge in its [[challenges_in_turkish_education_system | education system]], particularly regarding the formation and guidance of its elite classes and the impact on broader society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Decline of Elite Leadership

Contrary to a perception of the general populace as uncouth or peasants, the majority of the population in Türkiye is not composed of peasants, with this demographic falling below 12-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The Turkish people are generally well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. However, a significant problem exists with the "middle class," or the *nouveau riche*, who are described as extremely uncouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

The core issue lies not with those from village backgrounds struggling to adapt to urban culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, but with the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_turkish_elites | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This class, tasked with guiding the country and setting ideals, is poorly educated, representing the main problem for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Failures in Elite Education

The Republic of Turkey's greatest failure in education has been its inability to establish a proper system for educating elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. While the Republic successfully brought basic education to large masses, particularly after 1950 with primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, this minimum level of education is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. A society also requires an elite group to lead it and form its intellectual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Historically, the only opportunities for elite education in Türkiye were a few schools established during the [[cultural_and_educational_aspects_of_the_ottoman_ruling_class | Ottoman period]], many by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The Republic, however, hindered their development, leading to a decrease in their number and quality, and a narrowing of their budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Consequently, the number and quality of genuinely world-class educated people in Türkiye have steadily declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This level of education is now largely limited to a fortunate minority who study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Domestic education is criticized as merely a "stupid brainwashing program" that teaches how to be a civil servant and "bow down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. As a result, Türkiye has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## The Role of Religious Education

When the "westernized" and numerically limited elite fail to provide intellectual guidance, the populace turns to religious figures like "teachers" and "Hacıs" (pilgrims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. However, proper elite religious education has also been prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Comparing the quality of Islamic religious experts from the late 19th century to today reveals a significant decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This degradation is attributed to the flawed education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Public Thirst for Knowledge and Guidance

Despite the shortcomings of the elite, there is a profound [[public_thirst_for_knowledge_and_intellectual_guidance_in_turkey | public thirst for knowledge and intellectual guidance]] in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. The Anatolian people hold scholars in endless respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This hunger extends to fundamental issues, particularly religious ones, as well as topics concerning the universe, existence, Turkish history, and [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | social structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Even controversial subjects like the Armenian Genocide, the Kurdish issue, the Syrian issue, or whether Atatürk was a dictator are met with enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> "I mean, there is a great hunger for knowledge in Türkiye."

## The "Half-Educated" Segment

A specific segment of "half-educated Turks" who "think of themselves as white" are described as experiencing moral degradation and ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This group, estimated at 1 to 2 million people, is considered a "scourge of Türkiye morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. They lack social responsibility and the instinct to teach or contribute, focusing solely on personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This is attributed not to their inherent fault, but to the flawed education system that fails to instill a mission of guiding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

The actual elites, a smaller group of approximately 50,000 people, are profoundly alienated from Turkish society and envision no hope other than leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Their efforts to send their children abroad highlight a national tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

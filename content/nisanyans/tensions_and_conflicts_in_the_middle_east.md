The [[Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions | Middle East]] is currently perceived as "pregnant with very grave events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, with a "weak" possibility of keeping the recent incident under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

## Recent Escalations and Underlying Causes

The events of the past week and ten days are considered conscious and planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. The major triggering event underlying the recent conflict is the reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, which is seen as "an arrow directed at the heart of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

### Iran-Saudi Arabia Reconciliation
For years, the "meaningless hostility" between Saudi Arabia and Iran was fostered by the United States and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. This ongoing conflict ensured that no Muslim state neighbor could effectively challenge Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>. While Syria and Iraq were once considered threats to Israel, they were subsequently destroyed and crushed, with Iran gaining significant influence and even sovereignty in those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. Lebanon, particularly the southern provinces controlled by Hezbollah, also forms a "belt of hostility" extending to Syria and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, possessing significant financial and military power, were in strong conflict with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. As long as this conflict persisted, Israel "was in a position to sleep comfortably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. Therefore, the coming together of Iran and Saudi Arabia represents a "deadly danger" and a development that "threatens the existence of Israel as a state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.

### Gaza and Israeli Policy
Within 5-6 months of the Iran-Saudi reconciliation, it is understood that Benjamin Netanyahu and the right-wing coalition government in Israel "planned the destruction of Gaza as a solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. A peace treaty imposed by diplomacy would be a danger to Israel's existence, leading to the impression that destroying Gaza — by deporting its population to Egypt, dispersing them, and turning them into refugees to be sent to Europe or Türkiye — was a "rational policy" for the Israeli administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

There is no doubt that the recent "terrorist attack" against Israel was a planned incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. It is argued that the Israeli army and its electronic devices could not have failed to detect such an attempt from the border, suggesting they "knew about such an attempt and were waiting for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. The claims of 1,000 people killed, babies killed, and women raped are questioned, with the speaker suggesting these claims are exaggerated and lack evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. Specific claims, such as 260 killed at a concert or 40 children's heads cut off, are dismissed as lacking proof or being based on unreliable sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

An upcoming ground operation in Gaza is anticipated to be "very difficult" and involve "very serious blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. A military intervention by Hezbollah from the north would put the Israeli army in "serious trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. If Iran becomes involved in the war, it could lead to "a great apocalypse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. There is hope that common sense and intelligence within Israel will restrain or bring down Netanyahu's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>, with reports of "very serious resistance within the army regarding a ground operation in Gaza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.

## Israel's Existential Struggle
The State of Israel has been "struggling for existence since the very first day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>. It lacks the luxury of defeat, as its very existence as a state would be doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:43:00">[46:43:00]</a>. This fundamental calculation drives many of Israel's seemingly incomprehensible behaviors in both domestic and foreign policy, rooted in a feeling of "nothing to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.

Since 1948, Israel has never been "this close to the point of existence or nonexistence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>, with Benjamin Netanyahu being held responsible for this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:23:00">[47:23:00]</a>. The "incomprehensible rage of the right" and a "blinded aggression and war ideology" are seen as governing the country, defending "deep racism and an aggression policy that disregards world public opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>. This approach is considered a "very strange and incomprehensible event" given Israel's historical intelligence and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. It is suggested that Israel could have secured its existence with different policies and lived together with Arabs, despite Arab "stubbornness" and "cheap populism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:54:00">[48:54:00]</a>. However, since the 1980s and especially the 2000s, Israeli leadership has been "far from this tradition" of traditional Jewish wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:10:00">[50:10:00]</a>.

### The "Land Sale" Narrative and Historical Claims
The claim that Palestinians sold land is "terribly exaggerated and presented in a wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:45:00">[50:45:00]</a>. While some land was purchased by Jews, especially from large landowners (often in Lebanon or Syria) who saw an opportunity to profit, a "very large part of the land ownership" in what is now Israel was still in Arab hands in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01:00">[51:01:00]</a>. During the 1948 War, Israeli forces "systematically attacked the villages" to make Palestinians flee, and those who fled were not allowed to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07:00">[52:07:00]</a>. Thus, "a very large part of Israel's lands were seized through terror and pogroms and were not purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:29:00">[52:29:00]</a>. These lands were later nationalized and sold as "ownerless lands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:13:00">[53:13:00]</a>.

The claim of rights to the land based on being there 3,000 years ago is seen as illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>. However, it is noted that "logic is not sought in national causes" and societies "live by telling themselves fairy tales and believe in these fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>. The more significant issue is that Western states, claiming to represent reason, logic, and law, accept this "absurd claim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:48:00">[53:48:00]</a>. This acceptance is attributed to three factors:
1.  A sense of guilt in the Western world due to the massacre and persecution of Jews in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.
2.  The anti-Semitism of European countries, wishing for Jews to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>.
3.  Interdependence and obligation relations between Jews and Western states/large institutions due to large money movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>.

## Regional and Global Reactions
### Russia's Position
Russia is not thought to be ready to engage in another war given its current commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. There is also "a certain sympathy for Israel in Russia, both at the state and the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>, with Russia having been a sponsor of Israel since 1948 and many Russians living there with dual citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. Therefore, Russia is not expected to join the conflict or take an immediate stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. However, if Iran enters the conflict and appears unable to handle it alone, then "things will change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>, as Russia (and likely China) would not allow Iran to be defeated by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

### Arab World's Role
The Arab world currently lacks the inclination, power, or military preparations to enter such a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>. The possibility of Iran entering this war is "quite strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

The Arabian Peninsula, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar, is described as "one of the most dynamic, the bravest, the most future-oriented living regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>, undertaking ambitious architectural projects and rapidly moving away from its past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>. Riyadh, for instance, is noted as the city hosting the most international congresses and conferences globally in a given month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. However, the Arabian Peninsula lacks the population to be a "world-wide player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>, which results in superficial economies and a lack of serious military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:52">[01:47:52]</a>. For Saudi Arabia to truly become a power, it would need a large proletarian and peasant population, which Egypt could provide, but Egypt is considered a very backward country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>. This suggests that the "handicaps of the Arabs are as strong as their advantages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>.

## The Concept of "Terrorism"
The fight against "terrorism" has become a justification for states to permit all actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:37">[01:34:37]</a>. This is seen as a "strongest sign of the decay of civilization" and the "unbearable and unacceptable strengthening of states and their police forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>. The concept of "terrorism" itself was "invented in the 1970s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>, re-labeling rebellion or banditry. States and their security forces then launched a propaganda campaign that this was "the worst thing that existed and could exist on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

Historically, rebels and bandits have often been praised in folk literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:30">[01:36:30]</a>. However, since the 1970s, and especially since 2001, there has been a determined insistence that "under all circumstances the security forces are right, and the rebels... are the most vile representatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. This ideology argues that the tyrant is always right, and those who rebel without uniforms are wrong, even more so than ordinary criminals, because they oppose state authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:53">[01:38:53]</a>.

## Prospects for the Future
The possibility of a World War has "increased dangerously in the last week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. While the world may not react significantly if a "genocide in Gaza is completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>, it is also suggested that Israel "will not be able to accomplish the genocide in Gaza" because "the world balances do not allow it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>. Anti-war demonstrations are seen as largely ineffective in today's world because modern democracies do not allow election results to have real political consequences, and security forces are equipped to brutally suppress any attempts at regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. Such demonstrations are viewed as a "completely symbolic practice that has no consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

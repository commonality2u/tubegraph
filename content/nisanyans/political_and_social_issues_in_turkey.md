The speaker notes that he has been traveling for over a month, including a trip to Morocco and then Spain, where his passport was stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. His wife, a Greek citizen, went to Greece, while he, an Armenian citizen, went to Armenia to obtain new passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. After bureaucratic issues, he returned to his home, but his wife has not yet arrived and is joining them from Athens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## State of Law and Justice

The speaker highlights the sentencing of Selahattin Demirta≈ü and his friends to "terrible prison sentences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This is presented as an indication of the absurdity of having hope for [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]], suggesting that the country is beyond repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The rule of law in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] has been "destroyed" and "turned into rags" long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Beyond that, the sense of justice, conscience, and decency has been "radically destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Current Government and Future Outlook

The overall [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | situation of the country]] is deemed "not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The conditions for people to live in a safe, civilized, and humane environment have been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The current government, especially its head, and its "partner in power, the Freak Man," are held responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

There is little optimism for improvement through current political options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, with no promising option identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. The speaker believes that the current balance of power in [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | Trkiye]] can only be changed by "shedding blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Those who advocate against violence are seen as implicitly defending the existing order, as there is no indication that the current balance of power can be changed through politics, law, or street demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. The current distribution of power offers no hope to the people in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Armenia-Turkey Relations

The speaker spent a week in Armenia, engaging with its politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. He refutes "absurd news" in the [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | Turkish]] press claiming Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan denied the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Pashinyan's statements on April 24th and subsequent press speeches clearly indicate the opposite, and it would be absurd for an Armenian prime minister to deny the genocide, a fact known by Armenians from their families and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

Pashinyan's words are described as intelligent and carrying "real hope of reconciliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This includes suggestions that there is no need to dwell on the genocide case for over 100 years and the importance of Armenians reflecting on their own mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Such statements are interpreted as facilitating a healthier and more rational discussion of the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Pashinyan is understood to be taking significant steps towards reconciliation with [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] and Azerbaijan, even though Armenia was defeated in a recent war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. It is unclear to what extent he perceives goodwill or a willingness to compromise from the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

A condition for this reconciliation seems to be appeasing the United States, NATO, and European Union circles by making concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. The speaker argues that Western states, especially the U.S. since 1975, have consistently kept the genocide issue alive, fueled the flame, and reduced Armenian national identity to genocide commemoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Simultaneously, they encouraged "immoral denial" among Turks, particularly through Foreign Ministry staff, starting around 1974 or 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

### Western Media Portrayal of Turkey

Scanning old newspapers, the speaker notes a drastic shift in Western press coverage of [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. Until 1973 or 1974, Western (American and British) press almost exclusively published positive news about [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]], highlighting its civilization, modernity, beautiful beaches, and historical artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. After 1974, especially following Ecevit's rise to power, the narrative shifted, and [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkey]] began to be remembered as a "wild and evil barbaric country that has committed the greatest crimes in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This suggests that both the Armenian and Turkish narratives of the genocide are "fake and organized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Social Tensions

The speaker discusses the dilemma of balancing the rights of native people with those of later-settled citizens, using New Caledonia as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>. He then applies this to [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]]:

*   The population identifying as Turks, attached to Turkish traditions, is estimated to be around 60% in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:44:00">[32:44:00]</a>.
*   A crucial question arises: Do Turks have special rights in [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]], or does the country belong to all its citizens equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>?
*   The fertility rate of Turks has fallen below Switzerland, at 1.51, suggesting Turks could become a minority in 10-15 years, especially in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>.
*   The west of [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is losing population rapidly, while the inner east (Kurdish provinces) is increasing its population at a gallop, with abnormally many children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:03:00">[37:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.
*   This demographic shift means people are flowing from crowded places to abandoned ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. Towns and cities in the Aegean region are gradually falling into the hands of Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
*   Information on the impact of the Arab population in [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkey]] is also circulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>.
*   The numbers suggest that Turks will become a minority in [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] in a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.
*   This underlying fact is seen as the cause of the "madness-level irritability" of a certain segment of the population in [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | Turkey]], who are in a panic of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.
*   The speaker is pessimistic about resolving this issue without "bloodshed and large amounts of bloodshed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>.

## Critique of Kemalism

The speaker praises ƒ∞brahim Kaypakkaya, a revolutionary who took a "frontal stance against Kemalism" and defined it as "fascist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. Kaypakkaya is respected for being "very clear with a clear conscience" on the subject, unlike other Turkish leftists who still adhered to Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. The speaker argues that it is absurd to try to "decorate the sacred symbol" of a "cruel and unjust state" with revolutionary ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>.

The Republic regime, from 1923 until approximately 1960 (the single-party regime), aimed to create a middle class in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:00">[47:06:00]</a>. The Ottoman Empire was poor in terms of a middle class, and the Muslim Turkish middle class was weak and largely destroyed by compulsory military service from the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:00">[48:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>. Non-Muslims filled this gap in the 19th and early 20th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:39:00">[50:39:00]</a>. This situation, a Muslim-majority country with a non-Muslim middle class, was unsustainable and "exploded" in the early 20th century, leading Turks to destroy their middle classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>.

The Republican regime, therefore, "did what had to be done" by attempting to build a Turkish middle class, which was successful to a certain extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>. This new generation of technocrats and idealists, passionate about Western developments, started entering state cadres after 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43:00">[52:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>. This "Republican generation" of the Turkish middle class was a clearly defined group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:44:00">[53:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:01:00">[54:01:00]</a>.

### The Turning Point of 1960

The "breaking point" was 1960, which is also the "birth date of pathological Kemalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:49:00">[56:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>. The coup that overthrew the government in 1960 was a "very big trauma" for [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>. Before this date, [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]] had a more cosmopolitan culture and people who had seen the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:00">[57:11:00]</a>. After 1960, such individuals were excluded from state cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:27:00">[57:27:00]</a>. The coups of 1960, 1971, and 1980 (Kenan Evren dictatorship) "broke [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]]'s back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:00">[57:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:00]</a>.

May 27, 1960, marked the birth of Kemalism as a state religion, transforming it into a "tool of terror" used to intimidate and destroy independent thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:15:00">[58:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:19:00">[58:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:44:00">[58:44:00]</a>. Since 1960, Kemalism has been in a "spiral of collapse," and [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkey]] has not been able to recover, a situation that will not be fixed without a large-scale upheaval or bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>.

## Governance and Succession

The speaker touches upon whether monarchy can be a source of stability and prosperity in Islamic civilization, comparing Morocco and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34:00">[01:11:34:00]</a>. He notes that Morocco has a strong state tradition, while Algeria and Libya have little to no state history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48:00">[01:12:48:00]</a>. Egypt, despite being naturally richer and having a state tradition thousands of years older than Morocco's 1000 years, is not more advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07:00">[01:13:07:00]</a>. This is attributed to figures like Gamal Abdel Nasser, who "completely destroyed Egypt economically, socially, and institutionally" by governing with rhetoric and squandering wealth through bribes, leaving no money for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41:00">[01:13:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57:00">[01:13:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06:00">[01:14:06:00]</a>. Egypt, once the "food warehouse of the entire Mediterranean basin," is now a "hungry country" living on aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40:00">[01:14:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06:00">[01:15:06:00]</a>.

The speaker contrasts Morocco's monarch, whose legitimacy comes from ancestry and thus does not need to bribe the people, with Egyptian rulers (like Nasser, Sadat, Mubarak) who must offer alms to maintain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15:00">[01:15:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27:00">[01:15:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42:00">[01:15:42:00]</a>. He concludes that monarchies in Islamic countries (like Morocco, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait) appear to be more successful than those attempting democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40:00">[01:16:40:00]</a>. However, he cautions that a monarchy cannot simply be established; it takes three generations to yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29:00">[01:17:29:00]</a>.

## Ottoman Empire and Minority Rights

Fatih Sultan Mehmet's establishment of the Armenian Patriarchate is presented as a complex geopolitical move rather than purely modern behavior or respect for human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33:00">[01:27:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36:00">[01:27:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41:00">[01:27:41:00]</a>. Before 1071, in 1045, the Byzantines arrested and exiled the Armenian patriarch, leading to 400 years of chaos and division within the Armenian Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05:00">[01:28:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13:00">[01:28:13:00]</a>. Rival patriarchates emerged in different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04:00">[01:29:04:00]</a>.

In 1442 or 1444, a church council in Sis (Kozan, Adana) elected a single Catholicos, unifying Armenians under the protection of the Akkoyunlu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42:00">[01:29:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14:00">[01:30:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48:00">[01:30:48:00]</a>. This was a significant geopolitical event, as Armenians constituted the majority population and economic power east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17:00">[01:31:17:00]</a>. To counter this, two years later, the Mamluks encouraged a rival Catholicos in Kozan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37:00">[01:31:37:00]</a>.

Fatih Sultan Mehmet, anticipating conflict with the Akkoyunlu (e.g., the Otluk Beli War), established the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul around 1461, importing a man from Bursa to be its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18:00">[01:33:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:24:00">[01:33:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41:00">[01:33:41:00]</a>. The long-term function of this was "divide and rule" for the Ottomans, using the Armenian patriarch against the Greek patriarch and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10:00">[01:34:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18:00">[01:34:18:00]</a>. In 1453, Armenians were a very small minority in the Ottoman state, with Orthodox Greeks making up over half the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:34:00">[01:34:34:00]</a>. Their numbers only became significant after the conquest of the east (Otluk Beli and √áaldƒ±ran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05:00">[01:35:05:00]</a>.

## Current Political Dynamics

The speaker notes that the Erdoƒüan government "seems to have lost its initiative to a great extent," and its former agility is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52:00">[01:35:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00:00">[01:36:00:00]</a>.

## Ottoman/Kemalist Destruction of Cultural Heritage

Many tombs in villages across Anatolia and Rumelia, some dating back to ancient times, were destroyed during the Kemalist period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:19:00">[01:37:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33:00">[01:37:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:43:00">[01:37:43:00]</a>. Many of these pilgrimage sites were converted from pre-existing places, first Christian, then Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:58:00">[01:37:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11:00">[01:38:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00:00">[01:40:00:00]</a>. An example given is a site near Van where three Armenian young men were killed around 1870, initially visited by Armenians, then also by Muslims, becoming a tomb visited today under a new narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34:00">[01:40:34:00]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

A recent "big event" that will be remembered as a milestone in 21st-century history has taken place, leading to a significant victory for one side and a defeat for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This event is seen as a result of a compromise agreement involving Russia, the United States, Türkiye, Iran, and Israel, particularly concerning Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## The Losers in the Geopolitical Shift

### Russia
Russia suffered a "big defeat" in this recent event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It appears to have abandoned its claim to be a global player, losing its last military presence in the [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | Middle East]] in the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Even if it wins in Ukraine and Georgia, Russia has accepted its status as a regional power, able to influence only areas related to its immediate surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The only place Russia still has a military presence outside the former Soviet Union is the Sahel region in Africa, including Mali and Upper Volta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This phase indicates Russia has lost its ability to be an effective player on the world arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that a counterbalance against the one-way absolutist power of the United States and the Western military alliance is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. Russia's reliability as a partner has suffered a heavy blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, showing itself as a state without the possibility of projecting strong military force outside its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>.

### Iran
Iran has also suffered a great defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Its policy of establishing an influence area in the [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | Middle East]], pursued since 2001, has faced defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Syria is described as a "key door" for Iran to project power to the Mediterranean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Iran has significant influence in Iraq, especially Southern Iraq, and supports armed groups in Lebanon that pose a serious military threat to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. By losing Syria, Iran's ability to project power has become very limited by its geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. This strategic shift may paradoxically lead Iran to seek a modus vivendi with the United States and even Israel, creating a possibility of peace, as the strategic threat underlying its hostility with the Western alliance has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Losing Syria has pushed Iran towards becoming a small or medium-sized state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### China
China is also considered a loser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Its "Belt and Road Initiative," aimed at connecting China to Europe and the Mediterranean basin, relies on two key countries: Turkey and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. With both under NATO or American alliance control, China's major project has suffered a serious blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### The Speaker's Predictions
The speaker admits his own predictions "didn't come true again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. His assumptions that Russia and Iran could create a serious alternative to Western dominance, and that the United States was drifting like a rudderless ship, turned out to be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. He apologizes for basing his analysis on wrong premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

## The Winners in the Geopolitical Shift

### United States and Israel
The United States and Israel are identified as the primary winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. They have successfully implemented a long-prepared regional plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a> and "managed to get out of this game with 4 or 5 stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. The speaker notes the US has come to the end of a series of losing wars for the first time in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

This successful strategy, which began around October 9-10, 2023, involved several steps:
*   Turning a blind eye to Hamas's "extremely spectacular attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>, possibly even encouraging it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   Eliminating Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   Largely clearing or neutralizing Hezbollah, which had the potential to hit Northern Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   Overthrowing Syria, a key player, "with a single flick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

This strategy demonstrated that Americans are "not bad at chess either," achieving objectives without firing a single bullet or losing a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. The war drums from European states and American politicians were a "very skillful policy" aimed at intimidating Russia, rather than starting a third World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>.

### Türkiye
Türkiye appears to have gained a "certain advantage, albeit a small one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. While the Turkish press may overstate Türkiye's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>, the speaker acknowledges Tayyip Erdoğan's policy as successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Türkiye's role in the American-Israeli victory in Syria is considered quite small and marginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:52:00">[57:52:00]</a>. The Free Syrian Army, under Türkiye's control, is effective in Azaz and Afrin and has expanded its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Türkiye may gain a share in the reconstruction of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. It is suggested that Türkiye had no other choice but to participate on the victorious side, which was a "wise choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. Türkiye's foreign relations face restrictions, notably a lack of sufficient funds and indispensable strategic advantages like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.

### The Kurds
The Kurds are identified as those who will "benefit greatly from this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. It is understood that Syria will have a structure consisting of at least two regions: a Syrian state centered in Damascus and Aleppo, dominated by HTS and its allies, and a largely independent Kurdish region east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. This forms a "second Kurdistan, just like Northern Iraq" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. The speaker, who previously did not believe in a future for a Syrian Kurdistan, admits he was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>. The Kurds will have an important role in the new Syria, being one of the two main players at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Türkiye will have to compromise with and accept this new formation in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. Donald Trump inviting the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces regime (YPG/SDF) to a coronation ceremony is seen as an important symbolic event, signifying US support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

## The Future of Syria and Challenges of Re-establishing Order

The Syrian people are the "losers of this business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>, although if peace can be established, they could eventually be winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. The possibility of bending the will of the Alawite majority in Western Syria to a HTŞ regime is seen as weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

Historically, American intervention to overthrow dictators and bring democracy has led to prolonged conflict and division in countries like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. It is unclear if Syria will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.

Re-establishing state authority after its collapse in a society, especially when armed groups have seized power, is "one of the most difficult jobs in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. It cannot be done without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. Someone strong is needed to enforce orders and intimidate rebels, otherwise, Syria will fall apart into many pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.

## Debunking Geopolitical Clichés

The speaker challenges common clichés used in geopolitical discourse:

*   **"Dictator overthrown, for the good of everyone"**: The speaker questions if any regime in the world is not dictatorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a>.
*   **"He killed his people"**: This phrase is criticized as specialized terminology, possibly fed to the public by certain entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. All states, throughout history, have brutally suppressed rebellions against their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. Modern propaganda differentiates between "bombing its people" (when you like the target) and "bombing the terrorists" (when you don't) for the same actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.
*   **"Islamic terrorists"**: This concept is viewed as a cliché. The speaker argues that rebellious forces adopt ideological covers (like Marxism or Islamism) based on what is perceived as an attractive gathering point at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. The underlying dynamic is always a power struggle between state power and rebellious forces seeking political domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>. The ideological cover is merely "decoration" that does not affect the content of the struggle much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that whether "few Islamists win in Syria or many Islamists win," or whether their flag is green or black, are "children's thoughts" and "cheerleaders' analysis style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:00">[35:21:00]</a>. From a broad perspective, the conflict in Syria since 2011 has been a struggle between the Israel-America side and the Iran-Russia side, and one side won while the other lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. This [[Middle East political tensions and scenarios | geopolitical dynamics]] is the true essence of the situation.

## Broader Considerations on Geopolitical Dynamics

There is a question of whether Türkiye possesses the capacity to understand, analyze, and implement consistent policies in a rapidly changing [[Middle Eastern geopolitics and alliances | geopolitical situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:00">[54:03:00]</a>. While public international and diplomatic analysis in Türkiye is deemed worthless, there are likely smarter people working in the background within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intelligence, and the Beştepe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>. However, Türkiye's foreign relations suffer from clear restrictions, particularly a lack of money and indispensable strategic advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>, making it difficult to follow a strong foreign policy.

The distinction between America's withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's withdrawal from Syria is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. Russia was in Syria legally, invited by the Syrian state, and supported the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>. America, conversely, entered Afghanistan as an invader and established a puppet government before withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:00">[38:53:00]</a>.

The discussion also touches on the nature of rhetorical communication as the "art of persuasion," which involves clear, strong, and convincing expression using various psychological methods, not merely "fancy sentences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. This skill is seen as fundamental to effective communication.

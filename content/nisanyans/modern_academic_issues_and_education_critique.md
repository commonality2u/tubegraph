## The Evolving Function of Science and Academia

The traditional understanding of science as solely "seeking the truth about the universe" is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Any truth found might be an "additional benefit" or "side effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The fundamental function of science is described as identifying and "overthrowing" the mistakes of other scientists, driven by a motivation for power and the "re-adjustment of the balance of power within the institution and within the discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### Methods of "Winning" in Science

Historically, there are three primary methods to succeed in the scientific field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>:
1.  **Silencing through noise**: Overpowering opponents with "shouting and shouting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Reliance on authority**: Crushing opponents by securing support from higher authorities like rectors, deans, or the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
3.  **Logical reasoning and new facts**: Presenting more accurate reasonings and new facts within a framework of basic principles and debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

The third method is considered "the most noble, the most correct, the most beneficial to humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. For this method to work, there must be a common acceptance of basic principles and a consensus on methods of reasoning and presenting evidence within the academic and cultural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. This requires belief in reason and logic, agreed upon by "all smart people" since figures like Aristotle or Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

### Decline of Scientific Consensus

Since the 1970s, particularly in Western academic life, there has been a systematic destruction of consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. This has led to a situation where "everything can be generally accepted as true" and nothing said by authority is trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. As a result, the possibility of expanding the scientific horizon through new data and reasoning on a common knowledge base has "disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

Only the first two methods of "winning" remain: silencing opponents through "lagaluga and satay" (nonsense) or relying on higher authority, which could be the university administration, the state, public opinion, or dictatorial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This is described as a "pathetic situation" that leads to "very big disasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Critique of Modern University Education

The primary function of universities and institutes today is seen as training personnel for state and private institutions, bureaucracies, and large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This often involves training "dysfunctional" personnel who "do not produce anything that has any real-world value" but fill cadre needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. University education primarily teaches "bureaucratic working methods" such as paper writing, using Excel, and techniques for presenting ideas within a bureaucratic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. These skills are often "190% unnecessary functions and careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

### Consequences for Graduates and Society

Modern universities produce more graduates than the job market can absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. A significant portion, "perhaps the majority," become "waste" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. They leave university as "unemployable society" members who "do not and cannot make any positive contribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.

University education:
*   Does not teach "any art or profession that can be useful outside of bureaucratic institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.
*   Prevents young people from developing themselves in "any field that can be useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.
*   Leads to graduates lacking basic practical skills, such as changing a car wheel or fixing a light bulb, because their studies focus on "transferring paper within a bureaucratic institution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

This situation is described as "very tragic" and "one of the most terrible things in the world," as it results in young people educated until their late twenties or thirties having "no profession" and "no opportunity to find or learn any profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. It "dulls" the natural inclination of many people to pursue specific fields passionately and create jobs beneficial to society, like carpentry or watchmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

## The State of Freedom of Thought

[[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | Freedom of thought]] is increasingly restricted, making it difficult to conduct scientific studies healthily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. For [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] to exist, there must be a "Consensus on certain issues," especially regarding "generating and discussing ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. This consensus relies on "educated and experienced segments of the society" who are trained in these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. These individuals must agree on "a set of basic values" or a "framework of thought," within which infinite disagreement can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.

When this "common ground" disappears, [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] loses its meaning and becomes "just chaos" because "the rules for one idea to defeat another are not clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>.

### Absence of Impartial Arbitration

There is currently "no possibility for an idea to be evaluated by an impartial set of referees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. This leads people to use modern technology to "only chat with people who accept the same ideas as them," mutually confirming each other's views in "closed bubble[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

For [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] to function, there must be "a series of main concepts that are accepted as referees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. Since this "base, this consensus ground has been destroyed," [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] has "no functional meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. It is predicted that perspectives advocating for [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] will "rapidly disappear from circulation" globally, with people increasingly favoring censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

Historically, [[challenges_and_changes_in_social_sciences_and_educational_systems | freedom of thought]] was an "Elite concept," existing primarily "among people of a certain caste" and defined by "arbiters of thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>, not through a democratic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## The Future of Academia

The current academy, described as doing "nothing but produce paper for the tomb and recycling machine," is unlikely to genuinely become an academy again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. It is believed to have "completed its function as an institution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. While higher education institutions will always exist, the current structure is unlikely to evolve positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

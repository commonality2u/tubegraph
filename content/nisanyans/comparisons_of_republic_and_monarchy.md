The 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey was anticipated with grand ceremonies and celebrations, with expectations of significant political events, including a new constitution [0:01:48]. However, these expectations were largely unmet, and the centennial was downplayed, appearing as an "ordinary and unimportant event" by government policy [0:02:16]. In contrast to the official approach, a smaller group, described as a "sect" or "group of disciples," made efforts to celebrate the anniversary with demonstrations and online tributes to Atatürk [0:03:10]. However, for the country as a whole, the 100th anniversary of the Republic did not hold significant meaning [0:03:47].

From a historical perspective, the Republic is seen as an "episode" within a continuous state tradition that has been ongoing since at least 1453, and possibly longer [0:04:08].

## Continuities Between Ottoman Empire and Republic

The establishment of the Turkish Republic represents an important episode in the historical development of the Turkish state, but it is argued that continuities largely outweigh differences when compared to the preceding Ottoman period [0:04:49].

*   **International Identity** While the state's official name changed, the country has consistently been known as "Türkiye" among foreigners [0:06:47].
*   **State Narrative and Leadership** There is a clear continuity in the state's self-narrative, linking figures like [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Fatih]], [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Yavuz]], [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Abdulhamid]], [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], and [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Tayyip Erdoğan]] [0:07:43].
*   **Institutions** Key state institutions demonstrate continuity:
    *   The Turkish Armed Forces celebrate centuries of history [0:08:03].
    *   The Gendarmerie Organization's founding anniversary is celebrated [0:08:08].
    *   The Police Organization celebrates its 168th anniversary [0:08:15].
    *   Land registry records, the General Directorate of Mapping, and population administration show an "obvious continuity" [0:08:24].
    *   These institutions maintain their ideology and self-perception [0:08:44].
*   **Laws** Ottoman laws began undergoing radical reform and rewriting based on European models as early as the 1840s, starting with the Commercial Code and continuing with Criminal, Civil Procedure, and Penal Codes [0:12:14]. This legal modernization process continued into the Republic period [0:12:47].
*   **Debts and Traditions** The Republic of Turkey assumed the debts of the Ottoman State [0:12:53]. Many Ottoman traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices continued during the Republic period [0:13:08].
*   **Language** Turkish remained the dominant language. Although significant reforms in usage style occurred from the 1930s onwards, Turkish writers from the time of [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Abdulhamid]] continued to be legible with minor stylistic adjustments until the 1950s and 60s [0:13:20].
*   **Population and Identity**
    *   The collective identity, initially referring to themselves as "Muslims," later adopted the name "Turkish" [0:09:42]. However, these two groups largely overlap, representing "two different guises of the same cluster" [0:10:04].
    *   Foreigners (Armenian, Greek, French, Italian, English) consistently referred to the Ottoman Muslims as "Turks," regardless of their specific ethnic origins like Bosniaks, Albanians, or Lazs, distinguishing them from Arabs [0:10:42].
*   **Ruling Cadres** The Republic's ruling cadres were a continuation of the old state's elite, comprising individuals who graduated from its elite schools and served as commanders in its armies [0:11:41]. They established the new regime through a [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | revolution]] or coup but maintained the continuity of the state [0:12:03].

## Key Differences and Changes with the Republic

Despite significant continuities, certain fundamental changes occurred with the establishment of the Republic.

### Sociological Transformation: From Sovereign Nation to Single Nation

*   In the Ottoman State, the Muslim or Turkish segment was considered the "Sovereign Nation" in a multi-national order, holding a superior position [0:16:02].
*   This structure began to be shaken with the Tanzimat reforms and experienced major upheavals, leading to its gradual liquidation from the late [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Abdulhamid]] period [0:16:36].
*   The process of removing non-Muslims (elements other than Turks) from the population of Anatolia and Rumelia started in the 19th century, intensified in the early 20th century before the Republic, and continued throughout the Republic period, only ending in the 1980s [0:17:07].
*   As a result, the segment that was once the "Sovereign Society" aimed to become a "single Nation" during the Republic period, a "deep radical change" and a "historical transformation" [0:17:34]. This profoundly affected the country's sociological structure and the state's ideology and behavior patterns [0:18:49].

### Expansion of Bureaucratic Cadres

*   The modern state, a global phenomenon observed since the 19th century, saw an increase in the number and quality of duties undertaken by the state [0:20:43]. This led to a parallel need for a growing and diversifying bureaucratic staff [0:21:13].
*   A "tremendous increase" occurred in the number of literate individuals capable of administrative tasks. This was a global trend, not unique to Turkey or a republican system, as it also happened in [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchies]] like Iran and Jordan [0:21:44].
*   Although Turkey experienced a period of stagnation between 1908 and 1923 due to wars and civil unrest [0:22:32], the Republic saw a significant expansion of state cadres, from approximately 10,000 to 100,000 literate individuals [0:23:09]. While this led to a quantitative increase in education, it also resulted in a serious decrease in quality [0:24:10].
*   Hundreds of thousands from Anatolia and Rumelia were educated and integrated into administrative roles [0:24:33]. These groups became "the most loyal and enthusiastic supporters" of the Republican regime, viewing it as their "savior" [0:24:44]. This expansion provided opportunities for people from various societal segments who might not have had them before [0:25:14].

### Revolutionary Excitement and Idealism

*   In the 1920s and 1930s, Turkey experienced a "great [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | revolutionary]] excitement" among its administrative cadres [0:27:49]. This was fueled by the collapse of the old regime and the state's subsequent recovery, fostering a belief in starting anew and achieving success [0:28:14].
*   This sentiment mirrored a global trend after [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | World War I]], where there was a widespread desire to abandon old institutions and rebuild on "rational foundations" with a "new spirit" [0:28:46]. This [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | revolutionary]] spirit was evident in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, China, and Germany [0:29:12].
*   In Turkey, this "tremendous idealism" lasted until the 1940s, creating a wave of "[[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | revolutionary]] enthusiasm" [0:29:47]. However, the end result was largely "disappointment," characterized as "much talk and little action" [0:29:55].
*   **Comparison with Russia:** The speaker contrasts Turkey's experience with Russia's transformations under Peter the Great in the 18th century and Stalin in the 20th century. Russia, despite starting from a similar "miserable Asian society," achieved significant development, building cities, parks, libraries, museums, and a civilization from scratch through "tremendous mobilization by force," including "shedding blood" [0:30:20].
*   **Turkish Reforms' Limitations:** The reforms in Turkey were "superficial," its cadres "insufficient," and administrators, particularly the first generation of founders, often acquired power and wealth through "plunder" during the elimination of non-Muslims [0:34:16]. Their primary concern was to protect this acquired wealth [0:34:43].
*   **Leadership and Implementation:** While [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] and a small core cadre (barely hundreds) attempted to instill a Western-inspired dynamism, the broader founding generation largely returned to traditional thinking and management styles after his death [0:35:01]. This suggests that the failure to achieve radical transformation was due to the "inadequacy of the administrative cadres," rather than the backwardness of society [0:36:10].

### Change in Head of State Election Method

*   The most significant and distinct change brought by the Republic is the alteration of the method for electing the head of state [0:37:08].
*   Historically, for large, complex states or empires, the prevailing view was that a single strong leader was essential, and hereditary succession (father-to-son) was the most stable method to avoid conflicts [0:37:20]. This system allowed for personal rule by strong leaders or symbolic roles for weaker ones, with administrators governing behind the scenes [0:38:15]. This model, while sometimes effective, ultimately collapsed globally at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly after [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | World War I]] [0:38:42].
*   **Global Shift:** Centuries-old [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchies]] in Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary were overthrown [0:39:08]. China's 2000-year [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchy]] was replaced by a Republic [0:39:39]. This was a "fashion of the age" or a "necessity" driven by new social structures, ideologies, and management techniques [0:39:49].
*   **Republican Principle:** The new principle established that anyone approved by the country's elites and, even if only for show, by the public, could be the head of state [0:40:14]. The distinguishing feature of a Republic is that this change of administration is tied to a system, such as fixed terms (e.g., America's four-year term limit of eight years for a president) [0:40:33].
*   **Turkey's Deviation:** In Turkey and many other countries, the person who came to power did not readily give it up (e.g., [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] served for 15 years) [0:40:56].
*   **Real-World Results:** The speaker finds no "serious results" from this change in management technique in terms of real-world outcomes [0:41:48]. Countries like Iran, which maintained its [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchy]] until the 1970s, showed a development process similar to Turkey's [0:42:35]. Similarly, Jordan's [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchy]] exhibits comparable development, education, and literacy rates to republican regimes [0:43:55]. This suggests that changing the head of state election method does not make a significant difference in the sociological field [0:44:12].

## Addressing Perceived Achievements of the Republic

It is commonly observed that since 1923, Turkey has seen decreases in child mortality, increases in average lifespan and population, and improvements in public health [0:44:35]. Additionally, literacy rates, the ratio of urban to rural population, and the number of university graduates have increased, along with easier access to mass media [0:44:51].

However, the speaker argues that these are not solely achievements of the Republic [0:45:17]. These developments are global phenomena that have occurred in nearly 200 states, regardless of whether they are [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchies]] or republics [0:45:21]. There is "no significant correlation" between regime type and these indicators [0:45:34].

For example:
*   Japan, a [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchy]], experienced similar development [0:47:03].
*   Nigeria and India, with different political systems, also showed comparable evolutionary development lines [0:47:09].
*   Compared to an absolutist [[discussion_on_monarchy_and_stability_in_islamic_countries | monarchy]] like Saudi Arabia, Turkey's development is not exceptionally "bright" [0:46:26].

These widespread developments are attributed to the "era brought" by new state understandings, increased state influence, extraordinary developments in transportation and communication due to Western innovations, and the astronomical increase in the need for educated personnel and new educational institutions throughout the 20th century [0:47:31]. Therefore, the existence of a republican regime is personally seen as having no significant impact on these developments, which would have occurred regardless [0:49:14]. The [[revolutions_and_historical_events_comparisons | revolutionary]] excitement of the 1920s and 30s affected only a "narrow segment" and ultimately failed [0:49:33].

## Specific Points and Discussions

### Ankara as a Capital City
Ankara was not "created from nothing" [0:51:08]. In 1914-1919, it was one of Central Anatolia's three largest cities (alongside Kayseri and Konya), possibly the most developed [0:51:14]. Ankara is an ancient city, one of Anatolia's major centers since Roman times, with a population of 40,000-50,000 [0:51:41].
Ankara had a modern, planned neighborhood called Keçiören, founded by Catholic Armenians around 1910, consisting of two-story houses with gardens and regular streets, unique for Anatolia at the time [0:51:53]. This likely played a role in its selection as the headquarters for the national struggle [0:52:43].
Economically, Ankara was rich due to its near-monopoly on mohair, a major export [0:53:04]. The arrival of the Anatolian railway in 1880 also spurred its development [0:53:24].
Examples of cities created from nothing include Saint Petersburg, founded in a swamp by order of a ruler, and many planned capital cities established by new dynasties in China [0:53:51]. Historically, every city was founded from scratch at some point, including Istanbul (Constantinople) in 325 AD and Elazığ, founded as a military garrison and administrative center in the 1860s [0:55:21].

### Portrayal of the Turkish-Greek War of Independence
The speaker argues that defeating Greece in the 1919-1922 war was not an extraordinary feat [0:57:33]. Turkey, with four times Greece's population and economy, and a thousand-year military tradition, was inherently stronger [0:58:30]. The "trick" in the war was that the British and French allies "drove the Greeks to the field" as pawns, without direct military involvement [0:59:08]. The real concern for Turkey was the extent of British support for Greece [0:59:38].
The war is compared to the current Ukraine War, where the outcome between Russia and Ukraine alone is clear, but Ukraine is backed by the Western alliance [1:00:01]. Greece was similarly abandoned by its allies when success was not apparent [1:01:20].
The portrayal of the Greek War as a "great pageant" and "national epic of defeat" was a political calculation by [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] to present the Battle of the Commander-in-Chief as a personal success, laying the foundation for his own political future and [[understanding_the_concept_of_dictatorship | dictatorship]] [1:02:05].

### Gallipoli Campaign Strategy
The British-French allied navy failed to cross the Dardanelles by ship in March 1915 [1:03:40]. Their subsequent land invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915 was deemed a "crazy project" born of "extreme arrogance and pride," championed by Winston Churchill [1:04:04]. Their objective was to capture Istanbul within 48 hours to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war [1:04:30]. A secondary, less discussed concern was to prevent a possible Russian operation toward Istanbul [1:05:08].
Landing in Izmir was not a viable alternative as it was too far from Istanbul, requiring an impossibly large army to march [1:05:53]. The Çanakkale (Dardanelles) operation was intended as a "quick, cut and run" opportunist move [1:06:35].

### Cyrillic Alphabet Origin
The Cyrillic alphabet, used by Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, and some former Soviet communities, was named after two Orthodox saints, Cyril and Methodius, from Thessaloniki [1:07:16]. In the 9th century, they were sent by Byzantium to the Moravians (eastern Czech Republic) to teach civilization and create an alphabet for their language [1:08:14]. They started with the Greek alphabet, but adopted some letters from the Hebrew alphabet for sounds not present in Greek (e.g., S, Ç, Ş, Ü) [1:09:56]. After the Hungarian invasion destroyed the Moravian Kingdom, this alphabet and Byzantine Christianity disappeared in that region, replaced by the Latin alphabet and Catholicism [1:10:40]. However, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Russians continued to use the Cyrillic script [1:11:20]. The speaker notes it is interesting how many new alphabets and writing systems emerged across different parts of the world in the 8th and 9th centuries [1:12:01].

### Critiques of Travel Observations
The speaker addresses criticism that his observations on Russia are limited to "touristic centers," stating that he has traveled extensively in over 50 countries and lived in some for long periods [1:13:00]. He attributes such criticisms to the rise of rudeness and ignorance on social media, where people feel free to insult without the social brakes present in face-to-face communication [1:13:32].

### Freedom of Expression in Turkey
Freedom of expression in Turkey is not only limited by the prohibition of insulting the president [1:17:39]. There are severe restrictions regarding religion, which are described as "absurd," "very narrow," and "bigoted" [1:17:51]. Additionally, there is strong political control in the media, making it "very, very limited" to express views that do not align with the administration or powerful figures [1:18:16].

### Turkey in the 1990s
The 1990s followed the "Özal movement" from the mid-1980s, characterized by a focus on making money, having fun, and a disregard for traditional values, with a strong belief in Turkey's integration with the West and the European Union [1:21:40]. This was an optimistic period where the boundaries of press and expression freedom seemed to be opening [1:23:04].
However, this optimism gradually faded, giving way to pessimism around the mid-90s [1:24:27]. The Kurdish issue escalated, leading to a terror campaign, the destruction of thousands of villages, forced migration, and the assassination of Kurdish writers and businessmen [1:25:06]. The military re-entered political life with increased tyranny and oppression, making the 90s a "dark period" that culminated in the explosion of the existing political party system, leading to the rise of the Justice and Development Party around 2000 [1:25:51].

### Interest in Detailed Historical Narratives
The intense interest in niche historical topics stems from a desire to understand Turkey's past beyond the "stupid lies" of standard official discourses [1:28:20]. People perceive a gap between family histories and school teachings and seek to resolve this contradiction [1:28:38]. The speaker's extensive work on the history of Turkey's settlements aims to "purify" the past from official ideology's narrow molds [1:29:02].
The official ideology suppresses the country's "real history," which is characterized by diverse ethnic and cultural divisions, clashes, and rivalries (e.g., Arabs and Kurds, Laz and Chileans, old greengrocers and Circassians, Yörüks and Turkmens, Alevis and Sunnis) [1:29:50]. Denying these complexities and forcing them into a "stupid narrative" creates a void that people are seeking to fill [1:31:11]. Discovering these local, detailed histories is viewed as a "revolutionary service" that challenges the official narrative [1:31:24].

### Current Geopolitical Tensions and Turkey's Stance
There is a "very serious danger of war" on the horizon [1:36:53]. Turkey, aware of this threat, likely does not want to get involved, sending "very clear messages on both sides" [1:38:05]. For instance, while the President organizes a pro-Palestine rally, Turkish warships participate in NATO fleets in the Mediterranean [1:38:15]. Turkey's strategy appears to be to maintain a "smiling face to both sides" and stay out of the conflict, hoping to play a role as a "guarantor, patron, assistant, supporter, brother" in any future Palestinian order [1:38:34]. However, this is seen as difficult to achieve because the Arab world would likely not accept such a role for Turkey [1:39:01].

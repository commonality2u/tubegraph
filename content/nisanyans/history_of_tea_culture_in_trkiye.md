## Introduction to Tea's Dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
Tea's absolute dominance among beverages in [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | Trkiye]] is largely attributed to the Republican period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Early Introduction and Influences
Tea entered [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | Trkiye]] and the Ottoman world during the Tulip Era in the 1700s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The primary influences on Ottoman tea vision, traditions, and customs came from two sources: Iran (Persia) and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Russian Influence
*   The samovar, a tea-making tool, was introduced from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Russian-made samovars, large brass tools, were found in the homes of the well-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   All functional samovars were originally from Russia, with domestic versions being considered useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Europeans were generally unfamiliar with samovars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Iranian Influence
*   In the past, the best tea imported into the region came from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Shift from Coffee to Tea
From the 16th century until the early 20th century, coffee was the renowned beverage of choice for Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Europeans learned about coffee from [[cultural_and_historical_narratives_in_trkiye | Trkiye]] and the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Tea, introduced in the 18th century, was initially an imported luxury item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Republican Era and Domestic Production
Prior to the late 19th century, there was no significant tea production in [[major_historical_sites_in_trkiye_to_visit | Trkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although some tea production might have begun during the reign of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, and there was a story about planting tea in [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Trkiye]] on the border with Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, the systematic and conscious campaign for tea cultivation truly began in the Republican period, likely in the 1930s or 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### State Policy and Infrastructure
*   Tea was systematically planted in Rize province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   A Tea Institute was established in Rize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, and the state gifted or allocated tea saplings to anyone who desired them, initiating systematic tea production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   The primary motivation behind this policy was the inability to grow coffee in [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | Trkiye]], as it is a tropical plant requiring imports from places like Arabia, Yemen, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   During the early Republic (first 10 years) and the inter-war period, [[political_history_of_Turkey | Trkiye]]'s foreign trade capacity was weak and constricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Observing Georgia's successful tea cultivation in the Eastern Mediterranean climate, the state prioritized tea as a national policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   The first manager and pioneer of this tea project was a valuable person, commemorated with a bust at the Tea Institute in Rize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The concept of "nation" (`millet`) in Turkey has undergone a significant evolution, differing from its original linguistic and historical roots.

## Historical Linguistic Roots

The word "nation" (`millet`) is Arabic in origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. In Arabic, it means "religion" or "sharia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Classical Arabic dictionaries, such as Kamusa, define `millet` as religion and sharia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, referring to a path followed in belief, worship, and deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

In the Quran, the word `millet` is mentioned 15 to 18 times, consistently translated as "Religion" in standard Turkish translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Examples include phrases like "unless they follow the nation of Jews and Christians" or "Follow the nation of Abraham who turned towards the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. The exact Turkish equivalent of this word should be "Torah," encompassing the traditions, rules, beliefs, and narratives that define a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. This aligns with the Greek concepts of `ethos` or `nomos` (law beyond written statutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

Historically, until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "tribe" was not defined by biological race but as a cultural entity, something learned and passed down through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

## Shift Towards Modernism

With the advent of modernism in Turkey, starting around 1876 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>, the concept of `millet` began to shift:
*   **Ahmet Vefik Pasha (1876)**: In his dictionary, he defined `millet` as a "colon," originally meaning "religion and sect," while `ummet` meant "tribe and congregation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   **Åžemseddin Sami (1900)**: He noted the inadvertent use of `millet` instead of `ummet` and vice-versa, and criticized expressions like "Islamic nations" and "Turkish nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. He was aware of the conceptual shift and tried to correct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

### Mehmet Baha Bey's 1924 Definition

By 1924, Mehmet Baha Bey's "New Turkish Dictionary" provided a definition of "nation" that became standard for its time: "A community of people who live on the same land, of common origin and language, or have been living in the same country for a long time, who are under the administration of the same government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

However, this definition is critically examined:
*   **Territorial Unity**: Not universally applicable, as exemplified by the Jewish, Armenian, and Turkish populations living in different countries (e.g., Turks in Greece and Iraq) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Common Origin**: Physically impossible for most nations, as populations have mixed throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Japan might be an exception due to its island geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Common Language**: Not always true; for example, the Swiss have multiple official languages, and Ethiopians speak 72 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   **Common Interests**: Many historical and modern nations (e.g., Czechs and Slovaks, Azeris and Kurds, Ukrainians and Kurds) have not shared common interests for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Under the Same Government**: Koreans, for instance, are a single nation but live under different governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Modern Concept of Nation

The modern understanding of "nation" is simple: the citizens of a state are called a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. This concept emerged after the French Revolution with the rise of compulsory general military service, defining a nation as those under the state's command, holding its identity card, and owing it military service and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

However, this straightforward definition is often not openly stated because the ideology requires the perception of the nation preceding the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. People are taught to believe that they first came together as a nation and then established a state to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. In reality, the state defines the nation through bureaucratic means, laws, and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

There is no single logical answer to define a nation's origin or criteria, other than the bureaucratic act of population registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.

## Formation of the Nation in the Turkish Republic

The "nation" that founded the Republic of Turkey was systematically created and packaged between 1915 and 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. During this period:
*   Hundreds of thousands of Christians and Jews, whose sole mother tongue was Turkish, were excluded and deported from the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   Conversely, many Albanians, Cretan Circassians, and Kurds, who did not know Turkish, were included in the Turkish nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This demonstrates that language was not the primary criterion for inclusion in the newly defined Turkish nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

This process highlights how the concept of the nation in Turkey was constructed through state action rather than pre-existing shared characteristics.

## Population Dynamics and [[Political history of Turkey|Turkish Politics]]

A significant demographic fact impacting [[Political history of Turkey|Turkish politics]] is the rapid increase in the Kurdish population, especially its youth, in contrast to the aging Turkish population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. The average age of the Turkish population has exceeded 30, and the fertility rate is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. This demographic shift indicates that Kurds will play an increasingly important role in [[Political history of Turkey|Turkish politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. The question of whether they will operate within their own separate political movements or integrate into the existing order remains a decision for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Modern Western states are experiencing a significant loss of control, marked by a decline in administrative authority and social consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30">[06:30]</a>. This situation is leading to a rapidly accelerating instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[06:47]</a>.

## Elite Cadres and Their Insufficiencies

Administrative cadres in the United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union countries are reportedly in a state of panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00">[07:00]</a>. They lack the intellectual equipment, personality strength, and organizational capacity to address the ongoing crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>. Currently, their primary response is police suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42">[07:42]</a>.

### Impending Crises
The current administrative and legitimacy crises are expected to be compounded by two major economic crises:
*   **Military Defeat** The possibility of a military defeat is considered a strong agenda item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17">[08:17]</a>.
*   **Financial Collapse** A disaster in the form of currency collapse is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a>.

These overlapping crises suggest a bleak outlook for the elite cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>.

### The Refugee Crisis
Europe is facing a very serious refugee crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22">[09:22]</a>. A significant portion of society (over 10%) consists of "radically foreign" individuals who are unwilling to adapt to local culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55">[09:55]</a>. Their loyalty to their own culture and social assumptions is often stronger than that of native Europeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14">[10:14]</a>.

### Social Division in France
Observations in France reveal a "serious invasion" where large parts of cities and towns have "completely passed into the hands of Africans and Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01">[11:01]</a>. In contrast, the native French are described as comfortable, not working, and providing poor service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>. This has led to a feeling among some African and Arab populations that they are "the rulers of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33">[12:33]</a>, coupled with hostility towards the country's armed forces, creating an "explosive combination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a>.

Historically, France has experienced severe internal conflicts, such as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, where a segment of the population was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11">[13:11]</a>. Such developments appear "almost inevitable" not only in France but also in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13">[14:13]</a>.

## The Core Contradiction
The fundamental contradiction in Western societies is not primarily between immigrants and natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30">[14:30]</a>. Instead, it lies with an **[[analysis_of_western_liberalism_and_global_political_dynamics | urban managerial elite]]** that holds a globalist worldview, prioritizes wealth accumulation and consumption, and harbors hostility towards the rest of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54">[14:54]</a>. This elite, though seemingly powerful, is becoming increasingly marginalized and filled with anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23">[15:23]</a>.

While it might seem rational for this elite (e.g., European Union managers or U.S. Democratic Party cadres) to use immigrant populations as a "strike force" against the middle class (e.g., "an alliance of Macron and Algerians against the yellow vests") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47">[15:47]</a>, this alliance has not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a>.

This leads to a three-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33">[16:33]</a>, suggesting a trajectory towards "great destruction" and "great chaos" for Western Europe and European Union member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02">[17:02]</a>. In contrast, Eastern European countries like Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, and especially Hungary, seem to have protected themselves from this "disease" and exhibit a calmer, more cohesive social structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16">[17:16]</a>.

## Control of Information and Communication

### Modern Medicine Industry
The medical industry, encompassing doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and laboratories, has gained "uncontrolled power in society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37">[22:37]</a>. This power is believed to decrease the quality of human life and is characterized by "immoral, extremely wrong, extremely illegitimate" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57">[22:57]</a>. Any negative word against medicine is met with aggressive attacks, creating a "terror regime" that prevents rational discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32">[23:32]</a>.

### Google Search Engine
Google's search engine is criticized for systematically highlighting information that aligns with the state propaganda of Western countries and censoring everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>. It is viewed as a "brainwashing tool" and a "propaganda tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. The algorithm is described as "stupid" and prone to providing ignorant, American-teenager-like responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. This decline is seen as a manifestation of a "general trend" and a "management disaster" that has gone out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>, contributing to a "brain arrest incident in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.

### Twitter and Free Speech
Twitter is believed to be under attack from "deep America," which uses state-controlled APIs to "suck everything on Twitter like a tornado" for AI development and to identify anonymous accounts, sharing this information globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>. Efforts are made to economically collapse Twitter by overwhelming its servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>.

The quality of Twitter's content has reportedly improved significantly since new management took over, becoming "more interesting, more balanced, less censorship, less arrogant, less dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:27">[03:52:27]</a>. There has been a "great decrease in the attacks of bots" and a breaking of the "dominance of the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:43">[03:54:43]</a>. This shift is seen as a "gain for humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>.

## Philosophical Considerations of Power

The concept of "maturity" in a social context is defined as the ability to command respect and influence within a group, even when facing negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:37">[03:43:37]</a>. This involves understanding and leveraging interpersonal power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:39">[03:43:39]</a>. **[[the_dynamics_of_power_and_dictatorship | Social power]]** dictates who is superior or inferior in any given setting, from families to workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:08">[03:45:08]</a>. The subtle techniques of establishing and maintaining **[[political_power_and_scientific_progress | power]]** balances are complex and often learned through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:37">[03:46:37]</a>.

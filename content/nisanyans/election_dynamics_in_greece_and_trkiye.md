## Greek Parliamentary Elections
On the day of the broadcast, parliamentary elections were held in Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The speaker was not particularly interested in the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It seemed likely that the incumbent party would win again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The final results indicated that the New Democracy party won a definite victory with 41%, Syriza received 20%, Pasok 11%, and the Communist Party gained 7.3% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. The Communist Party notably increased its vote from 5% to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, and received its highest vote share from the island of Samos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

A general observation was made that it has become increasingly difficult to change governments through elections globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, possibly due to the advanced development of election technology and management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## [[current_political_landscape_in_Turkey | Turkish Political Climate and Elections]]
The speaker expressed a "nauseated stance" when thinking about the [[political_situation_in_trkiye | elections in Türkiye]], especially after [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Kılıçdaroğlu's latest statements and speeches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The justification that Kılıçdaroğlu spoke that way due to "political pragmatism" was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Political pragmatism, defined as adopting the "lowest admonishing discourse" for "petty calculations of the moment," was criticized as allowing politicians to act without truly believing what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:20]</a>. It's difficult to know if a politician's "badness" stems from genuine belief or situational necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:38]</a>. A political leader who lacks a clear stance or knows when to stop is untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:52]</a>.

The speaker questioned the strategy of an opposition leader who "prefers to go hand in hand with fanatic Turkish people" and consequently loses the Kurdish vote, which is their strongest source of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:21]</a>. This led to the query: "What is the purpose of the matches? Is it to ensure that Tayyip Erdoğan wins under all circumstances?" implying a conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Perceptions of Democracy and Modernity
A recent Washington Post article by Fareed Zakaria described [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_Turkey | Turkey]] as an "illiberal democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:09:21]</a>. The speaker posited that in contemporary propaganda, "democracy" often refers to places that the West likes or considers allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:44]</a>. Regimes with strong popular support, like Hungary, China, or Russia, are labeled as "massacres," while those governed by "a handful of degenerate oligarchs," such as Ukraine, are deemed democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:40]</a>.

The speaker contrasted the "moderate" figures like Ali Babacan with "strict regimes" in terms of secularization and modernization of Islamic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:39]</a>. Saudi Prince Salman, despite severe actions like the chopping of a critic in a consulate, is presented as moderate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:12:01]</a>. Ali Babacan is seen as a figure trusted by Western financial circles, a type that has always existed in the history of the Turkish Republic, like Kemal Derviş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:13:02]</a>.

However, a "great revolution" is occurring, particularly visible in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:53]</a>. Saudi Arabia is showcasing incredible architectural projects like a "new Kaaba" (a huge cube-shaped building) and "The Line" (a giant desert city designed like a space base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:50]</a>. These projects are a declaration that they are the "pioneers of modernity" and "leading power of the new age," claiming the West is finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:32]</a>. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has radically cut ties with England and America, reached agreements with Iran, accepted Syria back into the fold, and begun non-dollar trade with Russia and China, refusing to participate in sanctions against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:16:17]</a>. This represents a declaration of independence and a claim to redefine modernism without abandoning the Islamic label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:17:56]</a>.

## Hypothetical Presidential Actions
When asked what his first moves would be if he became president, the speaker outlined a four-step plan for a "radical President" seeking a serious regime change, not continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:41]</a>:

1.  **General Amnesty**: The first move should be a general amnesty for "political crimes" and "crimes of thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:09:42]</a>. This amnesty, however, should *never* apply to "crimes against women and property," including murder, theft, or rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:11]</a>. Such a law would unconditionally pardon crimes committed until a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:51]</a>.
2.  **Establish a Personal Intelligence Organization**: To accumulate power and ensure orders are obeyed by the "huge state mechanism," a new Intelligence Organization directly affiliated with the president is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:12:09]</a>. Existing state institutions are unsuitable because they are designed to protect the current order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:31]</a>. This new organization would collect useful elements from existing ones and liquidate the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:54]</a>.
3.  **Create a Special Budget (Treasury)**: Real power requires money that can be used freely, outside the public budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:53]</a>. The public budget is paralyzed by bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:15:11]</a>. This "special and special budget" is essential for a "Revolutionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:46]</a>. This process of creating such a budget is commonly called "corruption" in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:14]</a>. It would involve methods like taking commissions or bribes from businesses for permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:27]</a>. The modern world lacks true Capitalism or a free market; the state is the "big oppressor" and employer, with individuals earning money by doing business with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:17:13]</a>.
4.  **Ruthless Intimidation**: A head of state should be feared, not loved, as per Niccolò Machiavelli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:29]</a>. To ensure obedience, a brave and radical leader needs to make examples of "important people who are in sight" through arrest or even killing, to convey the seriousness of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:30]</a>. This step is not contradictory to the amnesty, as a game can have both offense and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:23]</a>.

### The Tyranny of Revolutionary Power
The speaker noted that this four-step process has been followed by many historical leaders, from Hitler and Lenin to American presidents, Napoleon, Atatürk, and Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:21:00]</a>. However, the continuation of such power is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Leaders who aim for great things eventually get stuck in a "spiral of tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:14]</a>.

*   The established Intelligence Organization becomes an uncontrolled oppressive force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:51]</a>.
*   The parallel budget structure becomes a "swamp of corruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:12]</a>, turning the country into an "economic gangster chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.
*   Arrests and killings, initially intimidating, lose their effect and must be escalated to maintain credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:50]</a>.

For these reasons, "every revolutionary turns into a dictator," and every dictator "has to retire after completing his useful life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:24:10]</a>. These conclusions are reached by those who seriously study history and consider the meaning of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:51]</a>.

## Concepts of Freedom
A friend's definitions of moral and political freedom were discussed:
*   **Moral freedom**: A person who can form their own value judgments with their own will and live accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:13">[02:15:16]</a>.
*   **Political freedom**: A person who can change or at least limit the political power they are attached to with their own choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:08]</a>.

The speaker critically analyzed these definitions:
*   **Moral freedom**: Argued that a person forming judgments purely from "own will" is impossible outside of Hollywood movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:36">[02:16:42]</a>. Value judgments are shaped by upbringing, accidents, fate, coincidences, and societal currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:50">[02:17:15]</a>. Individuals rationalize their behaviors, often driven by instincts and social obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:58">[02:18:21]</a>.
*   **Political freedom**: Described as a "very obvious deception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:54]</a>. The idea that individuals can change political power through their "own choice" is an illusion, as societal behaviors are aggregated in a complex way, not through individual agency over the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:23]</a>.

Despite these criticisms, the speaker acknowledged that political and moral freedoms *do* exist in the Western world, especially in the last 250 years, as the West emerged with a strong claim to freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:46]</a>.

### Revolutions of Freedom in the West
The Western world's freedom is attributed to two levels:
1.  **Ancient Freedoms**: A number of freedoms present since the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:24]</a>.
    *   The concept of freedom has been a fundamental pillar of Western political thought since the 12th-13th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:03">[02:46:06]</a>.
    *   This included the relative freedom of powerful "political race owners" (feudal lords, property owners) against the King, based on mutual respect and boundary adherence, unlike Ottoman ruling classes who were civil servants beholden to the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:18">[02:49:10]</a>.
    *   The independence of religious authority (the church) from the state/ruler was also a key principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:05">[02:47:15]</a>.
    *   This development was a result of Europe's fragmented and chaotic political structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:34]</a>.
    *   The speaker sees no significant difference between the freedoms of Europe and the "Bright Age of the Islamic World" (before the Ottomans), which was also fragmented with power shared among many feudal lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:25">[02:51:27]</a>. In the Islamic world, a theoretically and legally defined area of religious freedom existed, even superior to Europe in terms of the independence of the clergy from the ruler's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:38">[02:52:03]</a>.
2.  **Modern Age Freedoms**: A concept of freedom specific to the modern age, emerging from three stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:36">[02:31:49]</a>:

    *   **First Revolution (French Revolution, ~1750s)**: Individuals declared independence from the coercive dominance of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:21]</a>. This freedom allowed individuals to disengage from religious obligations and direct their thoughts and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:33:02]</a>. This resulted from a 200-year civil war in Europe, after which it was understood that religion could not be defeated, leading to a compromise: "whoever wants...can free themselves from the obligations of religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:35]</a>. This unprecedented revolution led to significant social, scientific, and political advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:54">[02:34:04]</a>, as people were freed to research and develop potentially dangerous theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:12">[02:34:42]</a>.
    *   **Second Revolution (Post-WWI, ~1918)**: Driven by massive rural-to-urban migration and the rise of gigantic cities, people gained the freedom of anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:21">[02:36:17]</a>. This allowed individuals to be invisible, free from local identity, traditions, and moral concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:03]</a>. This led to radical changes in customs, such as provocative women's clothing, acceptance of extramarital affairs, and art movements like Cubism and Surrealism, which aimed to shock rather than having a specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:19">[02:38:28]</a>.
    *   **Third Revolution (1968)**: Based on the rapid increase in university populations, diluting the previous function of university life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:42">[02:39:07]</a>. This led to a "tremendous freedom in sexual morality," underpinned by the development of birth control methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:16">[02:40:21]</a>. Sexual intercourse, previously a dangerous act with generational consequences, became less risky, opening new horizons of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:43">[02:40:17]</a>.

These three revolutions — the French Revolution (religion), WWI (traditional local identity), and 1968 (sexual life) — were crucial steps in moral and political freedom, making Western societies tremendously attractive to those who value freedom worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:24">[02:41:22]</a>. This period of Western attraction lasted from the 1750s to the threshold of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:42:02]</a>.

### Sustainability of Freedom
The speaker questions the sustainability of this "freedom climb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:36]</a>. While rules and customs restrict human potential, they also provide a framework for social unity and common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:25">[02:43:45]</a>. Stretching this framework increases freedom, but completely destroying it leads to collapse and dispersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:44:10]</a>. It seems that the West, after 250 years of increasing freedom, has reached a point of "bankruptcy" or "collapse," necessitating a re-establishment of certain things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:14">[02:44:32]</a>. The question is whether the current point reached is truly beneficial for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:59">[02:43:03]</a>.

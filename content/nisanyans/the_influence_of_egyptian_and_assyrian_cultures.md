This article explores the historical interactions and influences of Egyptian and Assyrian cultures on the societies of the Middle East, particularly in relation to the early Jewish states, drawing insights from archaeological records and textual analysis.

## Egyptian Culture

Ancient Egyptian records are notably comprehensive and originate from an [[influence_of_cultural_and_religious_dynamics_in_the_middle_east | extremely literate culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Despite their richness, these sources contain no information or even the slightest indication about the presence of Jews in Egypt or their exodus, a purported event occurring around 1000 BC or earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

In the period before the establishment of the two Jewish states (around 1000-1900 BC), Egypt frequently and for long periods occupied the region of present-day Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. The narration of "our ancestors defeating the Egyptians and Allah punishing the Egyptians" likely carries a political meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

### Influence on Early Jewish Narratives
The narrative of Moses originating from Egypt is explored due to the lack of archaeological evidence for the Exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It is suggested that the story might reflect past connections with Egypt or diplomatic maneuvers during the period of the Torah's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

Significantly, the names of Moses and his family members (Amram, Maryam, Aaron) are likely Egyptian, not Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Moses is depicted as having grown up in the Egyptian palace, potentially as an Egyptian Prince or Noble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This is unusual given that their names are not Hebrew and they are central to Hebrew mythology, yet Moses' lineage is not David's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

During the period of the Torah's writing (before the 8th century BC), Egypt was the dominant political entity in the region, with Egyptian hegemony and a struggle against or cooperation with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. However, during the specific times the Torah was written, Egypt was largely out of the political game, with Assyria and Babylon being the key players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

## Assyrian Culture

The Assyrians played a pivotal [[impact_of_political_and_historical_contexts_on_middle_eastern_societies | role in the region's history]]. Around 800 BC, a highly developed kingdom emerged north of present-day Israel, possessing at least two important cult centers and a rich aristocratic and royal class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This kingdom was completely destroyed by the Assyrians in 712 BC, becoming an Assyrian colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A significant portion of its population was exiled and settled around present-day Mosul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Non-Jewish, non-Hebrew tribes were brought in as colonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

After the destruction of the northern kingdom, Jerusalem's population increased fivefold around 712 BC, making it an important city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A kingdom centered in Jerusalem emerged, playing a political role as a buffer state between Assyria and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. King Manasse (75-686 BC) established an extremely profitable alliance with the Assyrians, becoming their most important source of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The Assyrian State eventually collapsed, replaced by the Babylonian State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Cultural and Religious Impacts
*   **Political Alliances and Religious Syncretism**: During the time of King Manasse, there was a period of wealth and prosperity due to the alliance with Assyria. This led to the appearance of seriously rich houses in Jerusalem for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This alliance also saw the introduction of various idols into temples, reflecting intensive contact and cultural exchange with the Assyrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Polytheism served as a diplomatic move, where accepting other nations' gods was a sign of respect and alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Northern Kingdom's Downfall**: The narrative in the Torah frequently depicts the worship of foreign gods, such as those of the Babylonians, Phoenicians, Philistines, Canaanites, and Assyrians, as a recurring theme for which people were punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This highlights a political movement opposing alliances with foreign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The destruction of the northern state, partly attributed to King Ahab's alliance with the Phoenicians and the worship of Baal, was a major crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.
*   **Development of Monotheism**: The concept of a single-centered temple and the emergence of a new cult by King Josiah, who destroyed other small temples and "discovered" the book of laws, highlights the political nature of religious reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This process of developing a radical monotheism, which demanded the destruction of other temples, was systematic and successful among these people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **Torah as "Official History"**: The narrative within the Torah, which speaks of a great kingdom founded by David and Solomon long before the northern kingdom's sovereignty, serves to establish an "official history" for the southern kingdom centered in Jerusalem after the north's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This "official history" aims to integrate refugees from the north and legitimize the new state ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

Archaeological findings do not support the Torah's narrative of the Israelites violently conquering the promised land from the Canaanites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. In fact, there's no significant difference between Canaanites and Israelites in language or beliefs, and no evidence of widespread destruction during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. These people have always been present in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. This suggests the Torah's narrative of Abraham coming, leaving Egypt, and reconquering the land is not supported by archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Official History
> The creation of the Torah's narrative is understood to be the primary period for the formation of its stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This text, considered sacred and divine, can be easily placed within a specific historical period and fits the patterns of "official history" production processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. The Bible's narrative is largely understood to have emerged during the time of King Hezekiah and King Josiah, responding to the political and polemical needs of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

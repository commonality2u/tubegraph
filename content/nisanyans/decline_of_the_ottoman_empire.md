The Ottoman Empire, particularly in its later periods, is a subject of intense scrutiny, with modern perceptions often shaped by television series that present a "strange militarist aggressive conquest" image or a "religious common people" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. However, a closer look at the 19th, 17th, and 18th centuries reveals a very different reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Three Periods of the Ottoman Empire
One perspective suggests the [[historical_analysis_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_decline | historical analysis of the Ottoman Empire and its decline]] can be broadly divided into three distinct periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>:
1.  **The Foundation and Rapid Expansion (up to 1500s):** This era saw the rapid establishment of an empire with "incredible speed" and "incredible dynamism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The Ottomans introduced a new type of Islamic Empire, marked by innovations outside previous Islamic cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This model was "extraordinarily successful for a short time," quickly expanding from Bursa to Vienna, Basra, and southern Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. It was characterized as a "slave Empire" built on "extremely strong central control" with the economy under state command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Compared to the "failed examples" of the Abbasid State and the Byzantine Empire, the Ottomans systematically and rationally sought to purify themselves from past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
2.  **The Period of Collapse (1550s to 1918):** Despite its initial success, this centrally controlled system was "very fragile," similar to the Soviet model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. It lasted only about a century before leading to "a great collapse with an inevitable logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This period, starting from the 1570s or 1580s and lasting until 1918, is described as one of the most "terrible social destruction cases in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Economic and Social Ruin:** The initial success of the Ottoman social experiment ultimately "dried up the marrow of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. The state-controlled production system, like the Timar system, collapsed between 1500 and 1590 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Villagers either fled or refused to pay taxes, leading to mass migrations of agricultural populations to mountains, adopting animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. A "large migration of plunder" from regions like Syria, Diyarbakır, Mosul, and Kirkuk into Anatolia occurred as tribes turned to nomadism and pillaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Towns lost significant populations, the economy collapsed, and trade volume fell to one-tenth of its former level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Luxury production ceased, literacy decreased, and uncultivated lands expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Impoverishment:** By the 18th century, European travelers noted that crossing into Ottoman lands meant entering a region of "isolation, abandonment, destruction and poverty, [where] civilization has ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. This was a stark contrast to the early 1500s, when Anatolia and Rumelia were among the world's richest and most urbanized regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. By 1700, they were "cast into the Stone Age," with literacy rates so low that finding a literate person in cities like Erzurum became difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. This was not solely due to external "imperial robbery" experienced by India or China, but rather an internal collapse of the production and management models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. The state could no longer provide security, fostering the rise of local feudal lords and gangs of looters who lacked proper administrative infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Exploitation of Surplus Value:** The Ottoman Empire's initial success and eventual collapse can be viewed through its "unprecedented level of surplus value exploitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. While at first, this surplus allowed for magnificent projects like mosques and palaces, the continuous exploitation eventually led peasants to "die of hunger," causing widespread rebellion and the inability to maintain the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. This model, similar to the Soviet Union's, eventually cracked because the level of exploitation surpassed what society could tolerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Local Powers
As the central state weakened, numerous regions became virtually independent. For instance, Egypt, despite being far from the center, had its own administration and became completely autonomous, with Istanbul showing little reaction to its occupation by the French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Similarly, figures like Kozanoğlu in Adana and Karaosmanoğlu in Bergama effectively ran independent states or principalities, even conducting their own foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. In the Balkans, Tepedelenli Ali Pasha governed Northern Greece and Southern Albania for decades, maintaining equal diplomatic distance between the Ottoman Empire and Napoleon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. The construction of palaces like the İshak Paşa Palace in Doğubeyazıt, challenging the authority of Topkapi Palace, symbolized the rise of these powerful regional entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.

## Modernization Efforts and Their Failure
By the early 1800s, the complete collapse of the Ottoman Empire was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. This led to a period of [[historical_discussions_on_ottoman_empire_reforms | historical discussions on Ottoman Empire reforms]], starting under Selim III and continuing under Mahmud II, known as the [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman Empire's modernization and westernization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. The clear model for these reforms was Europe, seen as "the only address of all success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. The approach was to adopt European consultants, education, languages, and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

However, these reforms, though "radical" and "seriously" attempted, largely failed to achieve their desired goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Their impact remained confined to a "narrow elite circle" in Istanbul, specifically within the Bosphorus, Beyoğlu, and Eminönü areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. While significant changes occurred within this elite, their reflection in the provinces was limited, leading to "unexpected results" and "uncalculated and unforeseen disasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

### Comparison with Japan and Russia
Unlike the Ottoman Empire, Japan and Russia successfully undertook similar [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization | modernization and westernization]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.
*   **Japan:** Benefited from an "extremely homogeneous society" where the entire population could be considered to belong to "the same culture and the same ideal, the same state, the same religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Its island geography also contributed to its independent definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.
*   **Russia:** While an empire spanning a "very wide geography," Russia managed to force or coerce diverse tribes into a "homogeneous culture," a "single common culture, a common ideal, a common lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. This allowed them to Russify taken lands and integrate various groups like Tatars, Georgians, and Ukrainians into a basic set of their own culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

### Ottoman Challenges to Modernization
The Ottoman Empire faced unique challenges:
*   **Lack of Homogeneity:** The Ottoman Empire was a union established by conquest and "tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. The communities subjected to this rule resisted losing their national or religious identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Consequently, the Ottoman country "could never become a nation" or "a homogeneous social entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. When the political structure was questioned, diverse voices emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Disintegration:** The "real turning point or destruction point" for the Ottoman Empire was Greek independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. This event demonstrated the risk of national identity leading to separate political formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. The Ottoman ruling class was reluctant to shake the established system, fearing that allowing new political experiments could lead to the physical destruction of the Muslim minority, which held sole rule over the country through conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural Isolation of the Elite:** The Ottoman elite, particularly from the 17th century onwards, cultivated a highly sophisticated but "incredibly narrow" and "very small" cultural circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. This "ivory tower" culture was not meant for mass consumption or understanding, as evidenced by texts like Şeyhülislam Esad Efendi's 1732 dictionary *Lehçetü'l Lügat*, whose preface was incomprehensible to all but a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>. This mentality explains the late adoption of the printing press; its purpose was not "for everyone to read, for everyone to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>. The elite believed that widespread literacy would threaten their power and their ability to exploit the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.

### Ottoman Conservatism
The Ottoman Empire's conservatism, especially from the 16th century, stemmed from an "economic blockage" and internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>. As the "pie to be shared was shrinking," ruthless central dictatorships emerged, leading to widespread executions and terrible internal conflicts within the ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. This was exacerbated by the weakening economic foundations and the end of the conquest and plunder process, which was the Empire's basic mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>. This internal strife eventually led to a desire for stability, as seen in the Tulip Period, where the focus shifted to cultural refinement and preservation rather than expansion or radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences
The [[historical analysis of the Ottoman Empire and its decline | decline of the Ottoman Empire]], particularly its failed modernization efforts from the 19th century onwards, has had lasting repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. Turkey, once among the world's richest and most cultured countries since 3000 BC, has, in the modern era, been described as a "misery and a garbage dump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:59:00">[43:59:00]</a>. This transformation over the last 500 years forms the basis of modern Turkish history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>.

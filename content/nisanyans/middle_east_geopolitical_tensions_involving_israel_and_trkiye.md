## Overview of Regional Conflict Risks
The possibility of a large-scale [[Tensions and Conflicts in the Middle East | Middle East War]] is extremely strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Israel appears to be actively trying to draw Lebanon and [[Iran]] into a conflict through a series of provocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Despite these actions, there is currently no apparent reason or possibility for Israel to attack [[Trkiye]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Such an action would lack strategic logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

However, in the event of a protracted, large-scale regional war, there is an extremely strong possibility that [[Trkiye]] could be forced into involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## Türkiye's Potential Role in a Regional War
When the President of [[Trkiye]] discusses the possibility of Israel attacking [[Trkiye]], it's not a literal prediction of an attack but rather a strategic statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. The President is preparing the ground for a potential justification for [[Trkiye]]'s intervention on an anti-Israeli front in a future war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This suggests a hostile relationship that could escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

A possible scenario involves Israel invading Lebanon, leading to anarchy in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Under such circumstances, [[Trkiye]] might be compelled to intervene to protect and support Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. This would necessitate preparing both Turkish and international public opinion for a potential war against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

While Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank are often considered internal affairs that don't strategically concern other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, a full-scale invasion of Lebanon, a sovereign state, would significantly alter the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. Such an invasion would upset regional balances, potentially forcing states like [[Syria]], [[Iran]], the United States, and [[Russia]] to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. This could shift the entire regional balance against [[Trkiye]], thus compelling [[Trkiye]] to take a side in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

## Israel's Objectives Regarding Iran
Israel views the defeat of [[Iran]] as essential for its own survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. It seeks to inflict a heavy defeat on [[Iran]], similar to what happened to Iraq or Libya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Despite Israel's technological and financial superiority, [[Iran]]'s significantly larger population and land area make it impossible for Israel to defeat [[Iran]] in a direct land war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Aerial bombings are considered merely "foreplay" or "preparation" for war, not the war itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Real wars are won through land occupation and the destruction of military mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

It is speculated in the press that Israel aims to draw America into a war against [[Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. However, an American invasion of [[Iran]] is deemed unrealistic and likely to end in defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Alliances
Wars are primarily won through alliances, not merely by the weapons possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Successful warfare relies on establishing strong, reliable alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.

Israel's main strategic advantage lies in fostering hostility between Arab states and [[Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. In a potential war between Israel and [[Iran]], the expectation is that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, other Arab countries, and [[Trkiye]] would align against [[Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

Recent actions by the Iranian president, such as shaking hands with Qatar's emir, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, and [[Syria]], immediately after a missile attack, are seen as crucial diplomatic moves aimed at countering this alliance strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia is considered the key country in this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>, with Egypt unlikely to act independently of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. If Saudi Arabia were to take an unexpected stance, Israel's future could be in serious jeopardy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

Israel's overarching strategic goal is to prevent the formation of any alliance among major [[Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions | Middle East]] countries against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. All of Israel's actions and statements should be evaluated from this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.

## Türkiye's Syria Policy and its Impact
The assertion that Israel's intentions extend to Lebanon and then [[Trkiye]] (a claim made by the Turkish President) raises questions about [[Trkiye]]'s past policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. If this concern is serious, then [[Trkiye]]'s efforts to destabilize [[Syria]], a vital power against Israel, since 2011 are contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. Trying to destroy the Syrian state is considered one of [[Trkiye]]'s biggest and most fatal mistakes in recent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. For [[Trkiye]] to remain a significant player in the [[Middle East Politics and Turkeys Role | Middle East]], it needs to make peace and shake hands with [[Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.

## Russian Passivity in Palestine and Lebanon
[[Russia]]'s passive stance regarding events in Palestine and Lebanon, compared to its intervention in the Syrian civil war, can be understood by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. What happens in Palestine does not strategically concern other countries, as those lands have been under de facto Israeli military control since 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>. Israel's actions in Gaza are considered an internal affair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>.

However, the situation changes with Lebanon. The destabilization or occupation of Lebanon would affect the vital interests of many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. Even so, [[Syria]] was [[Russia]]'s sole base and ally in the Mediterranean prior to the civil war, which [[Russia]] could not afford to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. It is unclear if Lebanon presents an equally urgent situation for [[Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>.

If [[Iran]] enters the war and faces defeat, [[Russia]] and China are expected to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>. They cannot allow the United States to secure a victory in the East, as complete American dominance over [[Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions | Middle East]] oil production and distribution would be a catastrophic blow to China, which relies heavily on oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. Therefore, a large-scale global conflict seems inevitable if [[Iran]] is defeated in a US-Iran war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>.

## Future of Israel
There is a personal prediction that by the end of the next 10 years, the state of Israel may no longer exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts in Europe
Europe is currently in a state of disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. European nations have succumbed to American pressure to declare "jihad" against [[Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. This has led to the unprecedented exclusion of Russians from the art, culture, science, and economic worlds, seen as a "disgrace and immorality" and "robbery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>. They are now slowly trying to find a way to revert these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>. This situation, particularly the "disgrace" of the Ukraine war, is predicted to lead to the breaking of the 60-year alliance between Western Europe and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

## Georgia's Dilemma
Georgia is currently facing pressure to open a new front against [[Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>. The ruling Georgian Dream Party is likely to win the upcoming elections by a large margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. This party, initially opportunist, has come to realize that the European Union and NATO aim to use Georgia as a "new Ukraine" against [[Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>. They are seen as provoking [[Russia]] for war, then abandoning Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>. The "West-West alliance" is characterized as "evil" and having "penetrated every cell of Georgian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>. The Georgian government is determined to pass laws and make decisions to counteract this influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Surprisingly, a large portion of the Georgian public opinion strongly supports the ruling party on this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>. The Georgian Church has also played an active role in this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>. This marks a significant shift from 2021-2022, when there was a strong anti-Russian atmosphere in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>. The prevailing mood now appears to have completely reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>.

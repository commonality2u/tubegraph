## The Current Global Transformation

The world is currently experiencing historical transformations on an unprecedented scale, moving away from a long period of immobility and unsustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The political balance established after World War I, which had undergone only minor adjustments, has now collapsed and transformed significantly, marking a "big bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This shift is seen as exciting because the previous order, particularly in America and Europe, was perceived as "rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While the outcome is uncertain, a major upheaval is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The [[2023 global economic and political events | Trump]] administration, for example, made an unexpected shift in style and position shortly after coming to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Ministers under this administration demonstrated direct, logical, strong, and brave speaking, a level of discourse uncommon in the Western world, signaling a new policy direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Ukraine Conflict and NATO's Decline

The Ukraine war is analyzed as an effort by America to maintain its hegemony over Europe, particularly Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Germany, under Angela Merkel, had previously made efforts to integrate its economy with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The war was seen as a measure to prevent this integration, despite the initial understanding that Ukraine would be defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The speaker reiterates a long-held view that America has been defeated in all recent wars it has entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A defeat in Ukraine, given the significant financial and political investment, would signify the end of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. NATO's basic assumption—that it will use overwhelming military power to repel attacks on member states—was undermined in the Ukraine incident, showing the alliance's inability to win a war and only managing to create chaos without achieving results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The defeat of the NATO alliance in Ukraine presents an "extremely risky situation" for America, potentially leading to the alliance's disintegration, especially while trying to control European countries like Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The initial goal of Russia's operation in Ukraine was to achieve a quick victory by occupying Kiev, but their strategy shifted to destroying NATO, recognizing that Ukraine could be defeated quickly when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. NATO is now considered "collapsed" and "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

## Shifts in Global Power Dynamics

Statements by US President [[2023 global economic and political events | Trump]] indicate a shift in American foreign policy, with Europe no longer being a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Europe is perceived as having lost its industry, military power, ability to act together, and is led by "extremely weak" cadres who maintain power through tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The speaker argues that the new world order will be multi-focused, with three major powers: America, Russia, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This period is akin to significant historical turning points like the Treaty of 1930 or the anti-Napoleon texts of 1813-14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The US Vice President's speech at the Munich conference was described as an unprecedented diplomatic "slap," stating that Europe has become a dictatorship, its leadership is inadequate, and that the US and Russia will resolve the Ukraine issue without European involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

China has also seized the opportunity to propose its Belt and Road Initiative as a joint project with Europe, aiming to draw Western Europe to its side if America and Russia come to an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### European Weakness and Disintegration

Europe's response to these developments has been marked by panic and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The European Union is seen as disintegrating, with England's departure and countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria taking stances against the EU administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The EU's decision-making ability is paralyzed, as evidenced by Hungary's veto threat on sanctions against Russia and military aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

European leadership is considered historically weak and composed of "stupid people" unaware of global realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The "European Union project" is seen as unsustainable, having become irrelevant to its initial goals and controlled by a "bureaucratic oligarchy" in Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

Economically, Europe is impoverished, lacking funds for large-scale public or private projects, infrastructure, or technology investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. New infrastructure and urban development projects globally are primarily driven by China and Arab private capital, with America also participating, but Europe has no money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

Demographically, the European population has not been renewed, leading to a ridiculously high average age for white Europeans, nearing 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. The solution of importing people from Islamic countries and Black Africa has led to an "unprecedented [[social_and_political_comments_on_historical_and_modern_issues | social crisis]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. Education quality has catastrophically decreased, leading to a decline in the quality of administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

### Romania's Political Shift

Recent political developments in Romania illustrate [[political_shifts_and_changes_in_global_power_dynamics | political shifts]] away from Western influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The US sent a representative to Romania, leading to the unexpected resignation of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This has seemingly "washed away" a long-standing NATO project, supported by England and America, to establish Romania as NATO's main base in the Black Sea, controlling the region from the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The collective uprising of the Romanian people, who rejected this "absurd adventure," has stalled the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## US Financial Challenges

America's financial resources appear to be nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This is prompting a radical determination by figures like [[2023 global economic and political events | Donald Trump]] and Elon Musk to significantly cut federal spending, an effort expected to have painful consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## The Gaza Conflict: A Strategic Analysis

The October 2023 operation in Gaza is described as a strategic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. Initially viewed by some as a heroic but suicidal attack by the attackers aiming to take hostages for prisoner exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>, it became clear within days that the incident's organization belonged to the State of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Given the intense surveillance of Gaza, such a preparation would have been impossible to miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

The operation's true purpose was perceived as "ethnic cleansing" and an attempt to "solve the Palestinian issue from its roots," albeit an unexpectedly brave and ultimately unsuccessful project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. The speaker asserts that many civilians killed, especially at the concert, were killed by Israeli state forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. The narrative of "terrible terrorists" killing "beautiful young girls" was created to justify the destruction of the Palestinian people as "self-defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. While this story was accepted by many in the Western world, its "real inner face" has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

## Latin American Politics and Leadership

In Latin America, leaders like Nayib Bukele of El Salvador are admired for their brightness and achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. Bukele transformed El Salvador from a gang-ridden state to one with significantly reduced gang activity and made great economic strides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>. He maintains a "moderate and distant friendship" with America, understanding that confronting the US is futile given the power imbalance, yet striving to remain autonomous and highlight his successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

Argentina's privatization project is viewed with suspicion, as it revives failed policies of the 1980s that led to widespread economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Argentina is seen as a "country without destiny," having continuously declined from its position as the second richest country in the Americas in the early 20th century, despite trying various political and economic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.

## The Turkish Political Landscape

In the context of [[political_developments_in_turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]], the speaker notes a complex definition of "Turkish." It refers to everyone living in Turkey and also denotes a "privilege demand" within the country, associated with a certain group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. The historical narrative often includes "lies" about Turkish origins, like claiming everyone is of "Asian origin" or from specific Turkmen tribes, which are seen as innocent attempts to elevate perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>. The speaker advocates for analyzing Turkish identity by differentiating various groups, such as Ahıska Turks, Kara Papaks, and immigrants from Rumelia, Bulgaria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.

Regarding the current Turkish political system, the speaker finds it difficult to understand the decision-makers' perspectives, viewing their actions as irrational, akin to "the last days of Pompeii" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. Policies like the arrest of an astrologer or the imprisonment of Osman Kavala are cited as examples of actions without rational justification, possibly stemming from megalomania or evil spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>. The speaker expresses a belief that Recep Tayyip Erdogan will continue his presidency for life, and a mass uprising or a collapse of the regime through a sudden loss of control over force are seen as potential scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>.

### Ottoman Legal History: Ebussuud Efendi and Birgivi Mehmed Efendi

The historical figures Ebussuud Efendi and Birgivi Mehmed Efendi are discussed in the context of Ottoman legal and political thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. Ebussuud Efendi, the Sheikh al-Islam during Suleiman the Magnificent's era, is known for shaping Quranic interpretation and ijtihad methods to align with state requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. He was a lawyer who believed law should be intertwined with the highest interests of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

Birgivi Mehmed Efendi, considered the greatest religious scholar of his era, held a more conservative understanding of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. As a legal scholar rather than a politician, he opposed some of Ebussuud Efendi's fatwas, leading him to leave Istanbul and establish an alternative thought and education center in Birgi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Birgi became an important academic capital, a place where scholars could work more freely from political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Birgivi believed science and fiqh should be largely purified from political influences, adhering to a classical understanding of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

## Critiquing Social Sciences and Political Systems

The attempt of social sciences to adopt a mathematical image, especially after 1945 by the American social science school, is critiqued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. While mathematics was crucial for physics, astronomy, and chemistry in validating new scientific methodologies against institutional authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, its application to social sciences is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. Physics and chemistry deal with "dead objects," but human behavior, involving "will" and "free will," cannot be explained mathematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. Mathematical and statistical methods can offer additional perspectives or help falsify hypotheses, but they cannot fully explain human phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

Much of what is taught as social science in universities, including sociology, economics, and anthropology, is described as an exercise in political and [[social_and_political_comments_on_historical_and_modern_issues | social propaganda]] to justify the superiority of one group over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Political science teaching, in particular, is considered propaganda that a priori accepts American and Western European political systems as good, aiming to teach how to emulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The use of numbers and equations in such studies is seen as a trick to appear authoritative without being understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

The traditional parliamentary institution is deemed obsolete and non-functional globally, requiring a new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. Secondary education institutions (middle and high schools) are also seen as bankrupt, with outdated curricula that are irrelevant to real life and contribute to young people's laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. Political parties, in their current form, are identified as the biggest obstacle to rational public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>. Additionally, traditional concepts of press and media freedom have lost meaning due to the collapse of the traditional system and the rise of the internet, which operates under a different reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

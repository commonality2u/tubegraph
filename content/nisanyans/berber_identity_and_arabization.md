The history of [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] reveals a complex interplay between indigenous Berber identity and the process of Arabization and Islamization. While the local Berber population initially resisted Islamic rule for several centuries after the Arab conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, a significant shift occurred in the adoption of Arab culture and Islamic identity by later ruling dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Adoption of Arab-Islamic Identity for Statehood
Almost all dynasties and rulers in [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] who governed under the guise of Arabs were, in fact, of native Berber origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. These various Berber feudal dynasties conquered the country and, without exception, boasted of their Arab origin and claimed to be "more Muslim than everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This adoption of Arab culture and the Islamic religion served as a "flag" for establishing statehood and dominating the country and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

According to the speaker, when attempting to establish sovereignty beyond one's own tribe or small geography, the "factor of Islam and the Arab civilization" became the tool to convince people and make them submit to a larger rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Dynasties, even those of Berber origin, would claim descent from figures like Hazret Ali and Hasan to legitimize their rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This strategic claim to Arab and Muslim identity was seen as a "condition of being a state" and having "state power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Similarities with Other Regions
The speaker draws [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | great similarities with Turkey]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Just as in Turkey, where rulers claimed [[cultural_and_historical_analysis_of_turkish_identity | Turkishness]] and Muslim identity, in [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]], a similar pattern emerged with the claim of Arab and Muslim identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The phenomenon of lineage tracing back to Khorasan in Turkey is paralleled by claims of lineage tracing back to Mecca or Medina in [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Being Arab was used as a complementary cultural element to being Muslim, serving a similar political purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

The political structure of the eastern parts of the [[ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] (east of the Euphrates) was historically very similar to [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]], characterized by local [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish principalities]] and Arab principalities that would sometimes submit to the state and sometimes rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Influence of Dominant Culture and Language
The speaker emphasizes that language is determined by the dynamics of political dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. In areas dominated by [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish principalities]], Kurdish became the dominant language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Similarly, in areas dominated by Arab tribes and principalities, Arabic became dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. This is observed in [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]], where despite a population that is 95% Berber, the dominant culture is Arab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, leading people to learn Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. People are pragmatic and adapt to the language of power to increase their social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

### The Role of Islam
Islam is inherently intertwined with Arab culture and the Arabic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>. Its traditions, history, holy book, prayers, and most of its sacred discourse are in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. Islam was shaped as the "language of the Arab Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. While it later spread to non-Arab regions like Iran, Turkey, and India, its core remains Arab culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. Key Islamic cultural elements, such as personal names (Mustafa, Muhammed, Fatma, Ay≈üe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a> and the common Arabic script used across the Islamic world until a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>, underscore this connection. For 1,300 years, higher education in Islamic countries was primarily in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. The speaker concludes that becoming Islamized is inherently linked to becoming Arabized, which is not negative, as Arab civilization is recognized as one of history's "great civilized civilization formations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.

## Limited [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Influence]]
While there is an admiration for the [[ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] and Turkey in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>, the direct effects of the [[ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] on [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] are not very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. The [[ottoman_empire | Ottomans]] twice attempted to assert control over parts of [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] in the 16th century, primarily to gain an Atlantic port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>, but their projects ended in "big fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. Despite this, some [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman influence]] is visible, such as the imitation of the Janissary army by the 17th-century Alawi dynasty, who established a professional army with Turkish commanders and officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The Turkish title "Pasha" was also used, as seen with Ba Ahmet Pasha, a prime minister and dictator in the 1890s, whose palace in [[cultural_and_architectural_influences_in_marrakech | Marrakesh]] is still called Pasha's Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

The "Armenian incident," often referred to as the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]], is characterized not merely as an event of 1915, but as the "final blow" of a "massacre, expulsion, usurpation and collapse process that has been going on for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This long-standing process culminated in what is described as a "finishing move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The 1915 Annihilation Project

The 1915 events were a "program taken and carried out by the Union and Progress administration of the Turkish state and the Ottoman state bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This was not a spontaneous act but a "conscious and cold-blooded decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is explicitly stated that this was "not a pogrom but an annihilation project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The objective was to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem that had been a problem for the Ottomans for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. To achieve this, the administration undertook "a serious organization with the help of the state" and "cleaned it up completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Role of Kurdish Elements

In executing this project, the Union and Progress administration utilized [[role_of_kurds_in_armenian_genocide | Kurdish]] Bey aghas and the [[role_of_kurds_in_armenian_genocide | Kurdish]] people "as allies and as helpers and subcontractors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an "existing tradition of massacre and extortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The Turkish state "used this successfully in the Eastern provinces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The state's approach essentially conveyed to these groups, "Okay, friends, you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you. Don't worry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This implicitly meant that individuals would not be judged for the crimes they committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

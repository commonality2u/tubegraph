The French Revolution, symbolized by the Bastille incident, is commemorated annually on July 14th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The capture of the Bastille prison by a crowd, the killing of its governor, and the release of its prisoners occurred in 1789 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This event is celebrated in France with grand festivities, including magnificent fireworks displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The [[historical_revolutions_and_their_dynamics | French Revolution]] and its impact are also explored through significant events like the "Night of Varennes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## The Night of Varennes

The Night of Varennes is another critical event within the [[uprisings_in_france_and_societal_changes | French Revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In 1791, during the second year of the revolution, King Louis XVI, who had become a virtual prisoner of the regime and the assembly, attempted to escape from Paris with his family in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. His intention was likely to join aristocratic forces in Germany and lead a war against the French regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, he was recognized and arrested near the Franco-Belgian border and forcibly returned to Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This incident served as the true radicalizing event of the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Up to that point, the revolutionary process seemed manageable within the existing regime, but after Varennes, it transformed into a full-fledged conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Approximately a year later, Louis XVI and his wife were executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Cultural Depictions

A movie about the Night of Varennes, which is highly recommended, offers an interesting perspective on the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The film fictionalizes the meeting of three prominent intellectual figures of the time in Paris amidst the chaos of the King's escape:
*   **Giacomo Casanova**: The famous Venetian womanizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne**: A critical and satirical writer, popular at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Thomas Paine**: One of the theorists of the American Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

This film is described as an intellectual and striking portrayal of the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Armenian surname practices underwent significant changes in both the Ottoman and Iranian Empires, reflecting shifts in language, culture, and societal norms. While there are similarities, distinct differences emerged, particularly in the linguistic suffixes adopted.

## [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian Surnames]]

During the last period of the [[Armenian history in Istanbul|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]], surnames often reflected professions or personal characteristics, frequently ending in "-yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Examples include Pastırmacıyan, Deveciyan (camel driver), Nalbantyan (farrier), Terziyan (tailor), Boduryan (short), Boşgezenyan (aimless wanderer), and Çolakyan (one-armed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Initially, until the late 18th century, most [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] did not have surnames, with only the aristocracy or elite families having them from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They were identified by their personal name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This absence of surnames was similar to the Turkish population at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

A rapid adoption of surnames occurred starting around the 1820s, leading to nearly all [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]] being known by surnames thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### [[Influence of Turkish language on Armenian surnames|Turkish Influence on Ottoman Armenian Surnames]]

A significant characteristic of these newly adopted surnames was their Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This was largely due to the fact that by 1828, Turkish was the mother tongue for the overwhelming majority of Turkish [[Armenian history and heritage in Turkey|Armenians]] within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In the 1820s, many [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians|Armenians]] either did not know Armenian at all or used it only for church or specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Even for those who spoke Armenian at home, Turkish was the common language for public conduct, particularly in bazaars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Therefore, for surnames to be declared to neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks), they needed to be in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The 19th century saw a great educational campaign that helped revive Armenian and introduce it as a cultural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While a few families adopted their father's name as a surname (e.g., Sarkisyan, Hagopyan), the vast majority chose names based on their profession or personal characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Many [[Armenian professions and surname origins|Armenians]] were engaged in specific professions like shoemaking, tailoring, or export, which distinguished them from Turks who often held official duties or were villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

It was only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, under the influence of modern nationalism, that some families with Turkish surnames changed them to pure Armenian ones, such as "Ken vos geriyan" for jeweler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, the original [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenian surnames]] remained predominantly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Iranian Armenian Surnames

Interestingly, Iranian [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]] followed the trend of Ottoman [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]] shortly thereafter, also adopting Turkish surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A key difference, however, lies in the suffix: Iranian [[Armenian surnames in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]] typically use "-yant" (with a 'T' sound at the end) instead of "-yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This distinction reflects the broader [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians|cultural difference of the two empires]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Callout: Research Opportunity

> There is currently no published doctoral thesis or significant publication on the "Armenian surname revolution" or "surname reform," a topic that could provide valuable insight into [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians|Armenian cultural and linguistic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

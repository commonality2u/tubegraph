The [[role_of_religion_in_society|role of religion in modern society]] is a complex and evolving topic, marked by internal critiques, societal shifts, and historical parallels. Discussions often touch upon the influence of religious imposition, the diminishing role of traditional practices, and the persistent human need for spiritual frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:23">[03:26:23]</a>.

## Critique of Islamism and Societal Reactions

Observation suggests that even deeply conservative and religious individuals are increasingly criticizing Islam and expressing contradictions within it without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:19">[03:11:19]</a>. This trend has reportedly reached a significant percentage of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:22">[03:11:22]</a>. The speaker acknowledges this observation but cautions against generalizing from small personal samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:09">[03:30:09]</a>.

It is posited that the imposition of Islam, or "Islamism," particularly over the last two decades, has "made Islamism... crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:38">[03:33:38]</a>. Efforts to impose the value judgments of a segment of society onto the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:47">[03:33:47]</a>, even to the point of "harassing the habits of small lives by putting a megaphone in the bedroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:11">[03:41:11]</a>, are seen as natural catalysts for reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:14">[03:41:14]</a>. Sociologically, this religious imposition is likely to result in the weakening of the Islamic religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:21">[03:42:21]</a> and cause a societal backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:21">[03:42:21]</a>.

## Weakening Religious Ties and Changing Lifestyles

Sociological changes, particularly in lifestyles, are seen as inevitably leading to a weakening of [[role_of_religion_in_personal_and_cultural_identity|religious ties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. Faith is described as a by-product of religious practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:05">[03:50:05]</a>. If daily life is immersed in religious practice, faith naturally follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. However, as society moves away from Islamic customs and traditions, and life rhythms are determined by a different world, individuals may eventually question the meaning of these beliefs, perceiving them as empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:52">[03:55:52]</a>.

While predicting long-term outcomes is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:17">[03:56:17]</a>, there remains a clear societal need for religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:23">[03:56:23]</a>. Nevertheless, major religions, including Christianity and Islam, appear to be struggling to adapt to contemporary challenges and new realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. This inability to keep pace suggests a strong possibility of them "losing the race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:05">[04:04:05]</a>.

## Historical and Philosophical Perspectives

### Protestantism in Islam

The idea of Islam producing a "Protestant sect" is questioned, as the speaker notes that Christian Protestantism originated as a clear Salafist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:06">[03:20:06]</a>. It was an effort to return to Christianity's original state, a "bigoted movement" from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:06">[03:20:06]</a>. Therefore, if one seeks Protestantism in Islam, they should look to the Salafis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>.

### Sheikh Shamil and Islamic Struggle

Sheikh Shamil of Dagestan is described as a Naqshbandi sheikh who declared a jihad against the Russians, fighting heroically for thirty years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. His army primarily consisted of Dagestanians and Chechens, with some Circassian groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. While some might have joined to fight Russia, it was fundamentally an "Islamic struggle army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.

### Ottoman-Turkish Hostility Towards Arabs

Hostility towards Arabs in Turkey began in the mid-19th century with the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This behavior stemmed from a desire by Ottomans and later Turks to assert their "Western" identity to Europeans, distinguishing themselves from Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. The mentality was, "We are not Arabs," implying Arabs are "insects, filth," while Turks are superior and culturally aligned with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>.

This sentiment was solidified as young Ottoman officers, educated in Istanbul and adopting Western attire, were sent to administer Arab lands like Yemen and Basra. These officers "automatically hated Arabs from day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. The cultural baggage carried by figures like Ahmet Izzet Pasha and Ismet Inönü, who cultivated an interest in Western classical music even during the Yemen War, symbolized this cultural alignment with the West despite fighting against Western powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. This historical context forms the basis for modern anti-Arab sentiment, including current hostility towards Syrians, which is rooted in the complex of "we are not them, they are inferior, we are racism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

### Doomsday Teachings

The pervasive belief in impending doom, such as "humanity living its last century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>, has been a constant for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. This manipulation of social psychology has always found adherents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. Such beliefs can lead to two main societal responses:
*   **"Let's have crazy fun"**: The idea that if the world is ending, conventional responsibilities and future planning are unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>.
*   **"Repent"**: The call to "go ahead and do ablution," "be a clean person," or engage in seemingly moral actions (like separating plastic waste) to prove one's morality before the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.
Both perspectives influence society in doomsday teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. The speaker advises against taking these warnings literally, suggesting a more constructive approach of asking, "What can I do to make this world a better place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a> for a healthier and more productive perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>.

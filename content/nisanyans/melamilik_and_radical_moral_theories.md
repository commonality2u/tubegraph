Melamilik (also known as Melamet) is not a sect, but rather a movement of thought that emerged in Islamic history during the 12th or 13th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. This movement significantly influenced various sects and added an important dimension to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. It is described as "the most radical moral theory you can think of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>.

## Core Philosophical Idea

The fundamental idea of Melamilik revolves around the concept that virtue is "almost always two-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:03">[01:56:03]</a>. The pursuit of virtue, displaying one's virtue, or acting virtuously, can be an act aimed at humiliating others, asserting superiority, and demanding deference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>. This external display of virtue can be seen as self-serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>.

Instead, Melami thinkers posited that to achieve true virtue, one must be condemned, blamed, or even commit acts that lead to humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>. The idea is that humility and the breaking of one's ego (nafs) are essential, and this can only be achieved by being perceived as a sinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>. This approach is described as a "terrible radicalism" and a way of thinking that "puts dynamite at the bottom of all moral theories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:28">[01:57:28]</a>.

Similar [[philosophical_discussions_on_morality_and_belief | ideas]] are also present in the mystical tradition of the West and in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>.

## Comparison to Jean Genet

This radical moral stance brings to mind Jean Genet, a French writer who was a criminal, thief, pimp, and homosexual, spending much of his life in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>. Genet wrote novels exploring deep [[concept_of_rights_and_morality | moral dilemmas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>. Jean-Paul Sartre's book about Genet explores the high virtue that such a "crime machine" might represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:33">[01:58:33]</a>.

## Melami Lodge in Albania

During a trip to Southern Albania, near the Greek border, a visit was made to a Bektashi lodge (Tekke) named Melani Tekkesi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>. This lodge is not mentioned in touristic sources and is difficult to reach via bad roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>. The speaker questioned dervishes there about whether "Melani" was related to "Melamilik" but did not receive a clear answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Although the dervishes did not explicitly confirm a link to Melamilik, the speaker still speculates about the possibility of the name being related to the philosophical movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.

## Modern Understanding of Melamilik

Finding accurate information about Melamilik in Turkish texts, especially online, can be challenging. Many resources might describe it inaccurately, such as "bullying people with feather pillows" or claiming it's about "caring about Allah, not about the values of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>. To find decent information, one might need to consult English texts, as there are perceived to be few publications in Turkish about Islam that align with logic and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Abdülbaki Gölpınarlı wrote a book on the subject, which the speaker read many years ago but cannot precisely recall or vouch for its current value, though Gölpınarlı is noted as an honest writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

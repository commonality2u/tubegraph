## Turkish Language Alphabet and Pronunciation

The "hat sign" (circumflex accent: `ˆ`), particularly over the letters `a`, `i`, and `u`, is a feature of the Turkish alphabet adopted in 1928, serving two distinct and independent functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. While initially designed for one specific function, its usage evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### Functions of the Hat Sign

#### 1. Indicating Thin Consonants
The primary function of the hat sign is to indicate a "thin" pronunciation of certain consonants, specifically 'k' and 'l' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

*   **Thin K vs. Thick K**: The Turkish language distinguishes between a thin 'k' and a thick 'k' sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. In older alphabets like Arabic and Persian, these were represented by separate letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Even in Kurdish and Azeri Turkish, separate letters (like 'k' and 'q') exist for these sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. In Turkish, a "made-up solution" was devised where the hat is placed on the *vowel* that follows the consonant, rather than on the consonant itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. For example, in "hatip," the hat on 'a' indicates a thin 'k' sound, while in "katil" (killer), no hat is used, even though the vowel sound is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The hat's purpose is to modify the preceding consonant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
    *   Anatomically, the thin 'k' (as in "katip") is produced with the tongue touching the middle of the palate, while the thick 'k' (as in "katil") involves the back of the palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
    *   This distinction is clearer in words of foreign origin (Arabic, Persian) but less so in pure Turkish words, where they often function as allophones (variants of the same sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Thin L vs. Thick L**: Similarly, Turkish features two distinct 'l' sounds, particularly in words derived from foreign languages, such as "Allah" and "ala" (different meanings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. The hat sign is also used on the following vowel to indicate a thin 'l' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

#### 2. Vowel Extension
The second function of the hat sign is to indicate the lengthening of vowels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. For example, the word "tamir" (repair) has a long 'a' sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

#### 3. Indicating Thin Consonant by Placing on Previous Letter
A third, more recent function invented by the Turkish Language Association is to place the hat sign on the *previous* vowel to indicate a thin consonant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. For example, in "hal" (state/condition), the 'l' is pronounced thin, and the hat is placed on the 'a' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This is despite the fact that "hal" can be read both long and short in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

### Debates and Practicality
The use of the hat sign, particularly for vowel extension, is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. It is considered unnecessary and impossible to apply consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Attempting to reflect every pronunciation detail in the alphabet can lead to dense, hard-to-read texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The speaker expresses a personal preference not to use the accent mark for vowel extension, as meaning is usually understood from context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. It is only used rarely, for proper names or marginal words where pronunciation might be unclear to the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

The speaker also criticized the Turkish Language Association for adding and then removing the word "Türkiyeli" from its dictionary due to public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. This act is seen as "despicable," as a dictionary's role is to document language as it is used, not to dictate or recommend words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. "Türkiyeli" is defined as a person born in Turkey, or belonging to its cultures, regardless of self-identification as a Turk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>, a category distinct from "Turk" but necessary for language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

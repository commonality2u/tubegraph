April 24 is observed globally as the day of [[commemoration_of_the_armenian_genocide | commemoration of the Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, particularly in Armenia, where it is a deeply emotional event involving widespread public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The date marks a political step that preceded the main events of the [[Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## International Recognition and Turkey's Policy Shift

For decades following the [[Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]], the Turkish state maintained a "policy of silence" regarding the events of 1915, particularly until 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. During this period, Turkish spokespeople and representatives were aware of the genocide but considered it unnecessary to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Prior to the 1960s, Turkey enjoyed a high reputation in the Western world and there was a general consensus not to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

A turning point occurred in 1965 when the [[Armenian Genocide | genocide]] issue was brought to the agenda in Soviet Armenia, initiated by the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Despite some murmurs in Turkey, the government maintained its policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

However, after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974 or 1975, the [[Armenian Genocide | genocide]] incident abruptly resurfaced in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. The emergence of the organization ASALA, which conducted attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies, led to the topic being widely remembered in the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. In response, Turkey adopted a policy of denial, which the speaker describes as "stupidity" and a "fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

Following 1974, Turkey's international standing in the Western world significantly declined after the Cyprus incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. A strong opposition to Turkey emerged in countries like America, France, and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. Turkey's stance of denying a past crime, which was widely known and understood, was seen as "impudence" and "rudeness," providing an excuse for other nations to provoke Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. This policy of denial, initiated around 1975, has persisted for over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on Denial

The speaker strongly asserts that discussing whether the [[Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] occurred is a "waste of time" and that denying it is a sign of either ignorance or immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This denial, according to the speaker, is known to be false by people worldwide, including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners, with Turkey being the sole exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

It is stated that the Turkish state systematically planned and executed a "genocide project" starting around 1895, with its infrastructure prepared consciously and systematically from 1913, and implemented in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. The explicit aim was to eliminate the Armenian and other non-Muslim populations of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Denying this fact is considered grounds for dismissing further discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## Missed Opportunities for Reconciliation

Between 2005 and 2011, a "window of hope" opened in Turkey for abandoning the policy of denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. During this period, there was a growing sentiment in mainstream Turkish media and even some Islamic publications to confront the [[Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. The issue was openly discussed for the first time, with many opinion leaders acknowledging the tragic nature of the events, regardless of whether they used the term "genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. It was recognized that millions of Armenians suffered immensely, harming Turkey in the process, and that the events represented a "shameful incident" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

Despite these discussions and the potential for a societal shift, Turkey ultimately failed to show the courage to officially acknowledge the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. Had Turkey confronted this issue, it would have shed a "heavy burden of hypocrisy" and overcome a societal "mental illness" carried for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. The speaker, as a citizen of Turkey, wished for the country to confront this issue for its own healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.

The [[Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] is viewed as the most significant social and political event of 20th-century Turkey, profoundly changing its societal composition and forming a psychological and economic basis for its political transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. The speaker highlights that the policy of denial has allowed the issue to remain an "unsolved blind knot," leading to missed opportunities for progress and new international relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

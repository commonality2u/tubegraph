## Definition and Educational Content of Kemalism

[[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] is described as a worldview adopted by individuals whose mental development seemingly stopped at the age of 9-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>. It lacks any rational basis or discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. The content taught as [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] in primary school (first, second, and third grades) is characterized as a "3-point formula" or an "April 23rd poem," possessing no other substantial content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. It is asserted that to be a Kemalist, one only needs to recite a poem like "Atam, You go to bed... I get up and I go to bed" with a strong enough voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

## Role in the Turkish Education System

[[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] has served as the basis of Turkey's [[educational_system_and_values_in_trkiye | educational system]] for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:11">[03:02:11]</a>. Within this system, [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] functions as an "indisputable authority discourse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

## Critique of its Impact

The pervasive nature of [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] in education has led to several criticisms:

*   **Inability to Accept Dissenting Ideas**: Individuals educated under this system reportedly cannot comprehend ideas expressed against [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. They perceive any questioning discourse as an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:30">[03:26:30]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Stagnation**: The "entire world of ideas" of Kemalist individuals is said to consist of simplistic slogans, marches, and heroism poems learned in early primary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This reliance on basic, learned content is seen as a "very, very sad thing" due to its lack of other substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:40">[05:06:40]</a>.
*   **Societal Dead End**: This intellectual limitation is directly linked to the country's perceived [[failures_in_the_turkish_education_system | failures in the Turkish education system]], leading it into a "dead end" and hindering its aspirations to reach "contemporary civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:47">[05:09:47]</a>.

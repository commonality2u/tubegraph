The role of youth in political movements in [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | T端rkiye]] is characterized by profound heartache, sadness, and a feeling of stolen hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Young people are seen as standing in direct opposition to what is described as a "raving, foaming dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Reasons for Youth Rebellion

The rebellion of youth is considered natural, prompting questions as to why they have not rebelled sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Several factors contribute to this sentiment:
*   **Erosion of Law and Justice** The law in [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | T端rkiye]] is seen as having been "completely torn apart" and turned into "the toy of a tyrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The fundamental claim of justice for a state has been "turned into rags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Disregard for Popular Will** The concept of popular will and vote, which underpins governmental legitimacy, is being "destroyed visibly and systematically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> and "trampled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Stolen Hopes and Future** Youth feel their hopes and future have been stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   Educational institutions are perceived as "garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, leading to no expectations from the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Basic rights, such as owning a house, getting married, and starting a family, have been taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Drug addiction has become a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Declaration of "Enough is Enough"** These cumulative issues lead youth to declare "enough is enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, garnering the support of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Nature and Effectiveness of Youth Uprisings

While youth express strong discontent, the effectiveness of their street protests in immediately changing governments is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Limitations** Short-term results are not expected from such uprisings, as they are likely to be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Governments typically require "force of arms" or an organized, armed force to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Impact** Despite short-term suppression, these rebellions are believed to have long-term effects, influencing future decisions, potentially even decisions to use arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Historical Parallels** Examples like the 2014 Ukraine protests and 2011 Syria events suggest that street demonstrations can serve as a "justification or excuse" for a coup prepared elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Similarly, the 1917 Russian Revolution saw a sudden popular uprising lead to state collapse, which few predicted two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
*   **Youth as a Dangerous Force** The "furious youth" are identified as the "most dangerous being on earth and in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>, with their potential for violence being unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

## Disconnection from Traditional Political Structures

Youth in [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | T端rkiye]], and more broadly in Western societies, are seen as disconnected from current political forces:
*   **Lack of Support for Oligarchy or Populists** Hopeless and desperate youth are "in no way in a position to provide any closeness, support or cadre" to either the bureaucratic oligarchy or populist leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Future Dynamics** The future of Western civilization, which [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | T端rkiye]] is part of, will be determined not by the bureaucratic oligarchy or populist leaders like Trump, but by the "furious youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

## Comparison to Gezi Park Protests

While a new uprising might resemble the Gezi Park protests, it is predicted to "run out of breath" within a week or two, much like Gezi Park ultimately led to a pacified populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. For such a movement to yield different results, an "organized and armed structure is essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Without it, the outcome will likely be arrests and a continuation of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

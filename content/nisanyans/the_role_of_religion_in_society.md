From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The topic of [[role_of_religion_in_society | religion's role in society]] often elicits strong, conflicting reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. One perspective posits that reason and religion are diametrically opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, a viewpoint common in Enlightenment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, it's argued that claiming reason is independent of religion can turn reason itself into another subject of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Persistence of Religious Belief

Empirical evidence shows that people continue to believe in religion even when non-belief is a socially viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This persistence is notable; for instance, after 80 years of compulsory anti-religious propaganda in Soviet Union schools, many still concluded that religion was beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The number of religious individuals globally is not decreasing despite scientific advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Social and Psychological Needs

Religion can fulfill deep societal and psychological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. For example, in oppressive environments filled with meaninglessness and lies, religion can provide something to cling to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Some individuals, like a Polish filmmaker who was a devout Catholic, found Catholicism essential for navigating their country's conditions, stating they "could not stand on [their] feet without being Catholic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The "escape from freedom" can also drive people towards religion as a solution to this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

## Rational Thought and Religion

[[intellectuals_and_their_role_in_society | Intellectuals]] and those representing rational thought should not ignore or belittle religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Instead, they must understand, embrace, and confront it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. A rational approach to religion involves understanding its phenomenon on a rational basis, discussing its boundaries, and determining its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Proposed Institutionalization
There is a goal to institutionalize seminars into a permanent structure, potentially a Faculty of Theology that adopts a rational approach to religion, unlike traditional theological faculties which primarily serve as vocational high schools for religious propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This endeavor is seen as a crucial step for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Rationality vs. Faith
Rational thought, described as the basic engine of human evolution, involves putting forward and testing assumptions to cope with complex data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This scientific method thrives on falsifiable hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, [[role_of_religion_in_society | faith]] and reason often reach a point where they cannot meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

**Evolution of Religious Belief and Falsifiability**
In its early stages, religion seemed to function as a form of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events, such as lost people attributed to jinns, or Troy's defeat explained by divine intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These early religious explanations were, in a sense, falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The Torah, for instance, contains scientific efforts in its descriptions of creation, akin to a "Big Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

However, religion evolved. In Judaism, God directly intervenes in history, making questioning divine stories politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Eventually, the concept of God became increasingly abstract and unfalsifiable by real-world evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This reaches a point where, for instance, in response to why injustice exists, the answer is simply "because I believe this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. True faith is presented as believing in something without rational possibility, and without the need for reason or empirical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

### Challenges for Non-Religious Individuals
Non-religious individuals in Turkey have historically struggled to engage with religious discourse, often resorting to dismissive or aggressive stances due to a lack of knowledge on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This has left the important domain of religion monopolized by religious people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

To address this, the approach is not to destroy a believer's religiosity, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Instead, the focus is on reinforcing non-religious individuals and those undecided about their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Communication with Religious People
Communicating about irreligion to religious people is complex. Lessons can be drawn from successful methods, such as those used by the Jesuit order, which has mastered indirect communication of Catholicism, focusing on moral and psychological issues rather than direct preaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Religion's Role in Society: Key Questions

*   How can rational thought embrace and discuss religion, potentially encompassing it within a "cocoon of reason" and ensuring reason acts as the referee in discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>?
*   How can religious phenomena, such as the origins of holy books (Torah, Bible, Quran), be explained through more rational and common-sense approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>? For example, the Quran's mention of Mary as the sister of Aaron might be a natural mistake by the author, potentially mixing two historical figures, and rational thought should be able to openly discuss such possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   What is the position of religion within Human Rights Law, and what are the limits of freedom of expression in religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>?

It is crucial to engage with these questions intelligently, especially given the political and cultural consequences of religious approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Ignoring religion or dismissing it as "worthless nonsense" is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.

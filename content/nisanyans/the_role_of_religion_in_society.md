Discussions about the [[role_and_perception_of_religion_in_society | role and perception of religion in society]] often provoke strong and negative reactions from diametrically opposed viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One perspective questions whether reason and religion are inherently opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, viewing the claim that reason is independent of religion as turning reason into another subject of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Persistence of Religious Belief

Despite historical efforts, such as 80 years of compulsory anti-religious propaganda in Soviet Union schools, people still drew the conclusion that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The question arises whether people continue to believe in religion even when not believing is a real social option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Empirically, the answer is "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

An example from Poland in 1981 illustrates this: an "extremely intelligent" and devout Catholic filmmaker explained that he "could not stand on [his] feet without being Catholic in a country like Poland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In an environment where public life felt meaningless, oppressive, and full of lies, Catholicism offered a necessary anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. While this may not be the "right solution," it highlights why people are "carried away by such a path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Despite scientific advancements, the number of religious people in the world is not decreasing, a phenomenon that intelligent individuals must confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is crucial to seriously explain and understand religion as a "persistent and permanent reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Rational thinkers cannot afford to ignore or belittle religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Proposed Rational Approach to Religion

There is a perceived need to understand the phenomenon of religion on a rational basis, discussing its boundaries and determining its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is considered an "extremely important activity for Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. A goal is to establish a permanent institution, possibly a new kind of "Faculty of Theology," that focuses on a rational approach to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Unlike existing faculties of theology, which function as vocational high schools for religious propagandists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, this new structure would bring rationality to religious study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Defining Rational Thought

Rational thought, often equated with science, is a method of learning and facing truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. It involves putting forward falsifiable assumptions, testing them, and modifying or replacing theories when confronted with contrary results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The human mind constantly forms and tests hypotheses to cope with the "data bombardment" of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Evolution of Religion

Religion, in its early stages, appears to have functioned as a form of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events (e.g., jinns causing people to get lost in forests, gods influencing battles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These early religious explanations, like scientific hypotheses, were not necessarily true but were falsifiable and attempted to explain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The Torah, for instance, in its creation narrative, demonstrates a "scientific effort" to explain the world's origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Judaism marked a significant turning point in religion's evolution, moving from a purely mythological field to a belief system where God directly intervenes in history and human affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This shift led to politically risky consequences for questioning God and stories about God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Over time, the concept of God became increasingly abstract and unfalsifiable, with "shells on shells" of incomprehensible features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

## Faith vs. Reason

At a certain point, faith and reason diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. True religious belief, as exemplified by the concept of believing in Jesus without needing to touch his wound, implies belief "without the need for the support of reason and experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. If one seeks rational proof or attempts to explain religious tenets scientifically, one is not a true believer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This is encapsulated in the idea of believing "to the point of absurdity because it is impossible to believe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

### Challenges for Rationalists

Rational thinkers in Turkey have historically adopted limited approaches to religion: either dismissive ("religious people are not worth talking about") or aggressive ("religious people are traitors, we need to crush them") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This has left the important domain of religion to the monopoly of religious people, leaving rationalists without answers in debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

There is a "serious war" if dissenting opinions on religion are threatened and if a religious approach gains political and cultural dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The question is how to combat irrationality with rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. One approach is to frame religion within a rational framework, making reason the "referee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

### Positivism and its Limitations

A common approach, especially in the Western world, is to assume that increased knowledge decreases ignorance, leading to the belief that all knowledge can eventually be attained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. This "positivism" can mistakenly claim that knowledge is the "monopoly of scientists" and religion is a "system of ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. However, science's feature is not that it is "true" but that it is a method where all propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. When a system claims ultimate truth that cannot be falsified, it risks becoming akin to faith itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

In contrast to positivism's assumption, it's argued that the more one's knowledge increases, the more one's ignorance also increases, as the vastness of what is unknown becomes clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

## Religion as a Fundamental Human Need

Religion endures as a widespread and permanent phenomenon because it responds to a real human need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Sometimes, people seek "escape from freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, finding comfort in established answers, such as "our ancestors said this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This provides a sense of certainty, contrasting with the human need to constantly research and question in a rational framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. When ancestral knowledge proves insufficient, the need for a higher, non-human, infallible source emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

## Communication and Maintaining Faith

Religious institutions, such as the Jesuit order in the Catholic world, have developed "extraordinary educational technology" for conveying religion to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. They teach indirectly, focusing on moral issues and psychological problems before religious doctrine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This highlights that people's faith is not as strong as assumed, requiring constant reinforcement mechanisms like calls to prayer and other exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. These efforts demonstrate a perceived "extremely strong possibility" of people falling out of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

## Current Discussions and Future Directions

Future discussions should involve analyzing the origins of holy books like the Torah, Bible, and Quran from a philological perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>. The aim is to explain religious data using "more rational, more common sense and rational thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. For example, a rational analysis of the Quran's mention of Mary could suggest the writer confused two different historical figures named Mary, although counter-hypotheses exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. This type of analysis, acknowledging the historical context and potential for error, contrasts with dogmatic interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

It is also important to discuss the [[secularism_and_freedom_of_expression_in_religion | limits of freedom of expression in religious matters]] within the framework of Human Rights Law, drawing on doctrines and decisions from bodies like the European Court of Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to "surround religion with reason" and "make it harmless in a cocoon of reason," ensuring reason acts as the referee in these complex interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

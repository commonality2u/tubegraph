## Turkishness as a Unifying Element

Initially, the foundation of the Republic of Türkiye in 1923 aimed for "Turkishness" to be a unifying element of citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. During the 1920s, official state publications and figures like Atatürk did not emphasize a Central Asian theory of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The early definition of Turkishness was broad: "anyone who adopts the Turkish national ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, including non-Muslims regardless of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Radical Shift After 1930

After 1930, and especially from 1932-1933 onwards, this policy changed radically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A racist theory emerged, claiming that Turks originated from Central Asia and founded all world civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This became the official ideology following the first Turkish Language Congress and first Turkish History Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Three main reasons are suggested for this shift:
1.  **European Influence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>: The rise of Hitler in Germany in 1933 and the increasing dominance of racist ideologies in Europe, including the "Mussolini model" of a single leader's will uniting society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, influenced Türkiye. The idea of "purity" suddenly dominated world discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  **Internal Political Balances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: The Central Asian theory of Turkish origin was popular among "Progress cadres" and "Turkish Hearth cadres" in the 1910s but was silenced after 1922-1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. From 1932 onwards, these previously silent cadres re-emerged, indicating a change in internal political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
3.  **Regime's Perceived Inadequacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>: The founding ideology of the republic was deemed insufficient to politically hold the country together, as it only appealed to educated, intellectual, and civil servant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Amidst turmoil in 1930-1931, including the Menemen incidents and rising discontent due to the global economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, the regime concluded that a return to Turkism (statist, leaderist, fascist, totalitarian, and racist) would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The **founding ideology** of the Republic and the **racist Turkist ideology** implemented in the 1930s are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Assimilation Policies: The Kurdish Example in Türkiye

The shift in ideology aimed to assimilate minorities, notably the Kurds. The hope was to "crush them if not in One Generation, we will assimilate them in Two Generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. However, this assimilation project did not fully succeed, partly because the Kurds proved "stubborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, and partly because the Turkish state's "fascist dynamism" from the 1920s and early 1930s loosened, preventing it from fully carrying out the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

A consequence of these pressures was a significant migration of the upper-class Kurds from eastern cities to Ankara and Istanbul, with families gradually disappearing from their regions after sending their children to schools in the major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The speaker also notes that "Kurdishness was given as a gift, it was left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, implying a degree of unexpected resilience or preservation of Kurdish identity despite assimilation efforts.

## Regional Comparisons of Minority Policies

When considering [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | other countries in the region]], a striking similarity in their approach to minority policies is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The speaker states that "each of these countries in this region suffers from the same stupidity and immorality to the same extent" regarding their minority policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Comparing the minority policies of Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia (especially its preparation policies), and Armenia reveals little difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. These countries are noted for the lengths they go to "invent an artificial history for themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, a practice also seen in Türkiye. The speaker notes recent intensive focus on Armenian national history and historiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, implying similar patterns of historical revisionism related to national identity and minority treatment.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

## Observations and Symptoms
There is a recognized [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_turkey | moral crisis]] and a management crisis in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Trkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. Incidents such as rape, murder, and mugging have significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. This environment is linked to intense depression, particularly observed among men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>, and a pervasive "endless hatred towards every living creature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The spread of these events on social media is seen as evidence of real [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | social decay]] rather than an artificial agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

This [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | social decay]] is characterized by:
*   An "incredible social decay" and "disintegration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
*   A sense of helplessness and anomie, where rules, laws, and moral principles are disregarded, and violence dominates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

The speaker notes that these phenomena are not unique to Trkiye, but are observed in about half the world, especially in Western countries like North America, and also in Latin American, African, and Indian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. China and Russia, however, appear to be exceptions to this trend of social disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

## Contributing Factors

### Hopelessness and Anomie
A profound sense of hopelessness has gripped society, particularly the younger generation, especially men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. This stems from a lack of aspirations and future prospects, including:
*   No clear path or goals in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   Absence of job opportunities, power, or ideals to strive for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   A dearth of trustworthy teachers or mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>.
*   No expectation of a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   Difficulties in marriage and raising children, which are increasingly seen as unbearable burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

It is posited that young men caught in hopelessness are the "most dangerous creature in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

### Societal Shifts and Crises
The current situation is attributed to several interconnected crises:
*   **Crisis of Modernity, Liberal Economy, and Democracy**: These three concepts are seen as fundamentally linked and contributing to the societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Rural-to-Urban Migration**: While having positive effects, this migration eroded the sense of belonging to a shared society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. The feeling of being "from here" which softens human savagery has been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
*   **Rootlessness and Individualism**: People have become rootless and family-less, leading to a breakdown of social bonds that previously civilized humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Economic Crisis and Middle Class Collapse**: The post-World War I ideal of states creating and maintaining a middle class, ensuring basic services like home ownership by a young age and retirement pensions, has "exploded" since the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. Home ownership has become nearly impossible for young people without significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.
*   **Failure of the [[educational_system_and_values_in_trkiye | Educational System]]**: Despite widespread university education, the system has lost its function and is "completely inadequate" in preparing individuals to be useful and respected in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

### Corruption and Abuse of Power
A significant factor contributing to the [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | societal issues]] is the unchecked power given to bureaucracy. When bureaucrats believe they will not be punished, they exploit the system, for example, by profiting from disaster relief through inflated tender prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. The systematic obstruction of private aid efforts during disasters, as seen in the US and mirrored in Trkiye's Elazığ-Antakya earthquake, is explained by bureaucratic self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. This creates a situation where individuals, like bureaucrats, prioritize personal gain even amidst widespread suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

### Political Leadership and Hatred
The daily spread of hatred by the head of state on television is identified as a factor contributing to the psychological impact on the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. However, this is seen as *a* factor, not the sole explanation for the broader [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | social decay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

## Outlook and Consequences
The confluence of these factors has created a society that has "turned into an explosive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. The speaker predicts that the situation will worsen considerably before it improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. Such countries, it is argued, become ungovernable through police measures alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Governing requires societal belief and collective protection, which are eroded when opportunities for welfare are eliminated, and traditional pillars like belief and family structures are weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

The speaker advises against simplistic condemnation of violent acts (e.g., "Look, these dogs went and beat a woman, may God damn them, they entered the hospital with a gun") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>, as this focuses only on symptoms rather than the underlying disease of desperation and impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. These acts are seen as forms of rebellion stemming from profound desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

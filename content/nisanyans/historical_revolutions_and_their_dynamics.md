Historical revolutions are often misunderstood, with a common misconception that they are orchestrated by well-organized political parties led by singular figures [00:43:00]. However, historical events suggest a different dynamic.

## Characteristics of Revolutions

### Spontaneity and Chaos
Many significant historical revolutions have been characterized by their spontaneous and chaotic nature, rather than being the result of meticulous organizational planning [00:43:32].

*   **The French Revolution** is cited as a completely spontaneous, chaotic movement that lacked any clear organizational logic [00:43:32]. It did not have a defined organization [00:43:40].
*   **The Russian Revolution** of February 1917 was unexpected, with no organizational incident in sight [00:43:51]. People suddenly rose up, raiding the palace, and administrative cadres panicked and withdrew [00:44:33]. The overthrow of the Tsar was unpredictable even a week before it occurred [00:44:51]. What Lenin did in October/November was a coup d'état, not the revolution itself [00:45:13]. The real revolution was a mass uprising, not driven by a known organizational infrastructure [00:45:53].
*   **The Iranian Revolution** also occurred with the uprising of masses, without a known organizational infrastructure [00:45:53]. Existing communist parties, like the Tudeh Party, were swept away by the revolutionary wave and subsequently liquidated [00:46:11].

### The Role of Revolutionary Organizations
Paradoxically, the existence of a well-defined revolutionary organization often *decreases* the likelihood of a revolution [00:47:35].

*   **State Power**: States possess superior resources, intelligence capabilities, and legal authority compared to any revolutionary organization [00:47:59]. Unlimited funds can be directed to security forces when a regime feels threatened [00:48:13].
*   **Organizational Constraints**: Revolutionary organizations tend to get entangled in the routines of social life, prioritizing their own preservation over revolutionary goals [00:48:59]. They become conservative, needing to pay salaries, rent, and make concessions, thus avoiding spontaneous and risky actions that could endanger the organization [00:49:34].
*   **Rule**: If a revolutionary party exists in a country, a true revolution is unlikely to occur [00:50:23].

### Triggers for Real Uprisings
True uprisings, involving people arming themselves, plundering, and lynching, often occur when young, unemployed men, particularly those in their 20s, feel they have no future and nothing worth defending [00:51:08]. This segment of society, described as the "most dangerous class of all humanity" [00:51:23], can become uncontrolled and prone to savagery [00:51:33]. These actions are unpredictable and often lead to the destruction of the state without the immediate capacity to build something in its place [00:51:52].

## Contrasting Revolutions: Guerrilla Warfare Model
In contrast to spontaneous uprisings, some movements have successfully seized power through sustained armed struggle:

*   **The Chinese Revolution (Mao)** and **The Fidel Castro movement in Cuba** exemplify a different model [00:46:28]. In these cases, leaders formed armed guerrilla forces in the countryside that grew into an army, clashed with state forces, and eventually took over the country [00:46:35]. This historical pattern, where a regional or local leader forms a military unit through an uprising to seize control, differs from spontaneous revolutions [00:47:02].

### Kemalism and Unionism
A common mistake is to exclusively identify Kemalism with Westernization and secularism. In reality, Kemalism has a dual ideological foundation [01:11:21].

*   **Internal Focus**: Towards the masses of Türkiye, Kemalism's essence was about defeating the seven powers, protecting the homeland and nation [01:11:38]. It was a Muslim movement based on Muslim nationalism, akin to a classical Islamic community understanding [01:12:13].
*   **External and Elite Focus**: Towards Western states and the elites of Istanbul and Izmir, an image and discourse of Westernization were presented [01:12:30]. A secularism project was also put forward to silence conservative segments within the country [01:12:50].
*   **Continuity**: Kemalism is seen as a continuation of the Unionist project [01:10:59]. Unionism itself originated from the Young Turk ideology, arising when the Ottoman Muslim ruling class faced the possibility of collapse in the 19th century [00:41:10]. Its core principles included maintaining Muslim rule, modernizing through Western knowledge, and removing non-Muslim elements [00:07:11]. The national struggle's financial and organizational foundations were formed by the Unionists, who adapted their project to a new world where much of the empire was lost and Western powers were dominant [00:09:27]. This meant getting along with Western states, partly to hide or seek forgiveness for "one of the greatest crimes against humanity in modern history" [01:04:42].
*   **Lack of Rupture**: Fundamentally, Kemalism is considered a continuation of the Ottoman imperial ideology, adapted to the conditions of the new age, with no real rupture at any point [01:14:04].

### [[societal_changes_and_historical_perspectives | Societal Changes]] and Political Future in Turkey
Turkey is currently facing a period of apoliticization [01:17:21].

*   **End of Democracy**: The era of democracy in Turkey has ended and is not expected to return soon [01:16:07].
*   **State Institution Strength**: State institutions, especially security institutions, have become extraordinarily strong, capable of making adjustments within the government composition without consultation [01:16:33].
*   **Lack of Opposition**: There is no effective opposition party left, and no prospect for opposition to win elections in the near or long term [01:17:00].
*   **Public Apolitization**: As a result, the majority of people are expected to become apolitical, finding political discussions boring and unnecessary [01:17:21]. Strong ideological feelings are only possible in a democratic environment with intense party competition [01:18:03].
*   **Declining Ideologies**: Both Islamist authoritarian ideology (AKP/Tayyip Erdoğan line) and the Kemalist-Unionist alliance (ethnic nationalist totalitarianism) are seen as entering a downward trend [01:19:01]. Islamist promises have proven unconvincing, and the Unionist-Kemalist line is divided internally, failing to align with the Turkish society's pragmatic habit [01:19:38].

## [[impact_of_historical_events_on_current_geopolitics | Impact of Historical Events on Current Geopolitics]]: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict

The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is described as a tragedy that led to the end of Armenian national existence in the region [02:22:43].

*   **2020 Defeat**: Armenia suffered a heavy military defeat in 2020, with Azerbaijan cutting off Nagorno-Karabakh's connection to Armenia by capturing strategic locations like Shusha [02:27:00].
*   **International Law**: Since 1991, the international community, including Russia, America, the EU, and Iran, has recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory [02:28:51]. Therefore, Azerbaijan's actions, though inhumane, are considered a domestic security operation under international law, similar to Turkey's actions in Dersim (1938) or the Ağrı rebellion (1930) [02:29:27].
*   **Armenian Policy Failure**: Armenia failed to resolve the issue on an international platform, and a rational policy would have involved negotiating the rights and security of Armenians within Azerbaijan [03:00:08]. Instead, Armenia deported its Azeri population in 1991, arguably blocking the future of Armenians within Azerbaijan [03:07:07].
*   **Karabakh Militant Cadres**: Since 1991, militant cadres from Upper Karabakh have dominated Armenian politics, effectively holding Armenia captive to their cause for 30 years [03:10:00]. The hope is that this tragedy might lead to the removal of these cadres from Armenian politics [03:32:20].

## [[power_dynamics_and_elite_control_in_western_societies | Power Dynamics and Elite Control in Western Societies]]: Mass Immigration

Global immigration has reached unprecedented levels, particularly in the Western world, with movements from the Mexican border into the United States and across the Mediterranean to Europe [03:39:55].

*   **Scale**: An estimated 2 million people are expected to enter the US from the Mexican border in 2023 [03:50:05].
*   **Government Stance**: Governments appear to be practically encouraging illegal immigration, acting as if nothing is happening [03:56:07].
*   **Explanations**:
    *   **Incompetence and Irresponsibility**: One possibility is the unparalleled low quality of leadership cadres in Western countries [03:58:11]. Leaders like Justin Trudeau or Annalena Baerbock are seen as inadequate for governing major nations [03:59:07].
    *   **Need for Cheap Labor**: A more weighty explanation is that Western countries consciously encourage immigration to acquire cheap labor [03:59:45]. Western citizens are expensive to employ due to high wages and extensive social rights [04:00:08].
    *   **Demographic Collapse**: There is a significant decrease in the white European and American populations, with an incredibly increasing average age, leading to a shortage of workers [04:00:56].
    *   **Modern Slavery System**: By allowing illegal immigration, governments enable employers to hire people cheaply and deport them easily in case of any "social unrest" or "slightest mistake," creating a "fairly modern slavery system" [04:10:00]. This mirrors the historical practice of importing slaves to the American continent [04:11:00].

## Brain Drain from Empires

A notable difference exists between the brain drain from the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire after their collapses in the early 20th century [01:03:05].

*   **Russian Brain Drain**: Following 1917, an incredible brain drain occurred from Russia to European countries. Writers, scientists, businessmen, composers, artists, and musicians became a main vein of European modernism in the 1920s and 30s, with many later migrating to America and forming influential groups [01:03:57].
*   **Ottoman Emigration**: In contrast, Ottoman cultural figures and educated cadres who emigrated either became impoverished or lived in obscurity, with none achieving significant social success or widespread recognition [01:05:03].
*   **Reasons for Difference**:
    *   **Fewer Cultured People**: The Ottoman Empire had a significantly smaller number of educated and cultured individuals compared to Russia [01:05:41].
    *   **Return to Turkey**: Unlike Russia, a regime was established in Turkey that promised a good future, leading many educated cadres who had gone abroad to return [01:07:02].
    *   **Elite Purge in Russia**: The Russian regime declared the existing elites as enemies, seizing their homes, properties, and careers, forcing them into exile [01:07:44].
    *   **Type of Emigrants**: The brain drain from Turkey consisted primarily of rentier staff and administrative staff, not educated professionals [01:08:00].

## Leaders Who Lost Wars and Continued Life in Peace

Historically, some leaders who initiated and lost wars have managed to live peaceful lives in other countries:

*   **Kaiser Wilhelm II**: The German Emperor who started World War I abdicated and lived for many years on his farm in the Netherlands [01:09:09].
*   **Idi Amin**: The dictator of Uganda, after being overthrown in a civil war, escaped to Saudi Arabia and lived there for many years [01:09:41].
*   **Mikheil Saakashvili**: The former president of Georgia, who declared war on Russia and was defeated, fled his country and became mayor of Odessa in Ukraine. However, he was later fired, returned to Georgia, and was imprisoned, serving as a counter-example to living peacefully [01:10:15].

The fate of leaders like Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine remains uncertain [01:15:39]. While he initially performed well as a national hero, his later public appearances showed signs of distress [01:13:27]. Internal political struggles within Ukraine's administrative staff suggest instability [01:15:14], leading to speculation that Zelensky might "lose his life" before being able to enjoy any properties abroad [01:15:44].

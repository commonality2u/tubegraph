The recent coronation ceremony of the Turkish president and subsequent appointments have brought significant changes to [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | current events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These developments are largely perceived as positive by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Key Changes and Perceptions

### Cabinet Appointments
The removal of Süleyman Soylu and other "gangster-looking men" from the previous government is considered a positive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. There's a noticeable decrease in individuals with strong [[role_of_ideology_in_turkeys_political_landscape | ideological obsessions]] in the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. While the Minister of National Education remains a "big question mark," other appointees are described as "sane Effendi classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Specific appointments highlighted as positive:
*   **Hakan Fidan** to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: This is seen as the right step, acknowledging that running a state, especially in an unstable environment like Turkey, is a "dirty business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Vice Presidency**: The appointment to this position was a "great surprise effect" and is considered significant, not a "bogus position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The cabinet reportedly includes two potential future presidential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Minister of Internal Affairs**: The appointee, a former governor, is considered the "most awesome they can find" for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

The new cabinet's overall message is "unexpected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Despite the "hateful and threatening rhetoric" during the election period, the general sentiment expressed is "let's hope that it will be good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### International Reception
The high number and quality of foreign heads of state attending the coronation ceremony are seen as a sign that Turkey is "on the right path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This includes leaders from "extreme left regimes" like Venezuela and Armenia, and those working against "American imperialism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Their congratulations, while not validating the president's character, should prompt self-reflection from the Turkish opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## The Aftermath of the Election
The recent election is viewed as a "turning point for Turkey," though a large segment struggles to accept this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The opposition's defeat was a "rout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | political style]], style, and method used by the opposition until now are deemed ineffective for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The opposition's "incompetence and incompetence have really reached the level of treason" – treason to the opposition itself, not the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. There's skepticism about the likelihood of a "serious democratic election in Türkiye in the near future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the "last election was the election of the liquidation of the opposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, with the Republican People's Party and HDP suffering significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This absolute defeat means there is "no need to get tough," as the opposition has been "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts and Turkey's Position
A "big change of evidence in the world" is underway, with "old owners of the world" on the "checkerboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. New economic systems and military alliances are forming across Europe, Africa, East Asia, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Key [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | global geopolitical changes and Turkeys position]] noted:
*   **Syria's re-admission to the Arab League** is a "historic step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Shift in Persian Gulf maritime security**: Historically provided by the US Navy, Saudi Arabia and UAE withdrew from US alliances and, under China's sponsorship, decided to form a joint naval force with Iran and other Gulf countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This is a "historical transformation" likened to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **New currency and payment unit**: A decision was made to create a new currency and a new Development Bank, with nearly 50 countries applying to join the BRICS group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

In this context, it's crucial for Turkey to take its place in this new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. A very difficult step for Turkey is the withdrawal of its military forces from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This requires a comprehensive agreement covering Rojava, mutual compensations, population exchange, and migration, potentially involving Turkey and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Turkey must withdraw from Syria or "they will make it suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, as it "alone cannot challenge Iran, Saudi Arabia, the entire Middle East and Russia," especially with shaky Western relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. A comprehensive solution for the Kurdish issue is also needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, possibly integrated into a broader peace agreement with Iran involving Azerbaijan and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

The visit of the Armenian head of state to Ankara is viewed positively as a "very brave decision" and an "important event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. It's believed that "they are cooking something" behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Reflections on Political Conduct
The speaker advises against emotional reactions to politicians' actions. Instead, one should ask: "Why did he speak like that? What is he trying to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a> Assuming sanity, understanding the politician's calculation provides more satisfying answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

Regarding the lack of women in the new cabinet (except one "very solid woman"), the speaker questions the modern trend of appointing women to high political positions as a condition of modernity and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The speaker points to various female leaders in Western countries as examples of "the worst and corrupt politicians in history," suggesting that such appointments often serve as a facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. The speaker argues that putting a "senile old man" or a "beautiful and empty woman" at the top of politics serves the same purpose of "selling images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. This reflects a broader observation about the [[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | political landscape and dynamics in Turkey and the world]], where real rulers remain camouflaged while "jesters" are put forth for public spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.

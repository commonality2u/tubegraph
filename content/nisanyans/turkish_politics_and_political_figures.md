[[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Politics]] is described as the "only topic right now in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The speaker expresses a dislike for discussing [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | politics]] as it can get "on people's nerves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Political Figures and Parties

Current [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | political figures]] mentioned include Meral Akşener and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The speaker also declines to answer specific [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | political questions]] about the "tissue discord" between the CHP and the Good Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

Specific political parties mentioned in the [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | current political climate]] include:
*   **CHP (Republican People's Party)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>
*   **Good Party** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>
*   **MHP (Nationalist Movement Party)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>
*   **AKP (Justice and Development Party)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>
*   **HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a>

### The Gülen Community

The speaker holds "mixed feelings about the Gülen Community since the first day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, stating they have "never been against it, nor have I been a supporter of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The speaker struggles to understand how to react to a project that aims "to seize the state through a secret organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The involvement of the "United States of America's secret intelligence agency" is seen as an element that "seriously reduces the value of this movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. However, the speaker does not approve of the "vile policy of oppression" implemented by the [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Turkish government]] since 2016, which has trampled on law and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. As long as this policy continues, the speaker finds it "not right to say anything against the Gülen Community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, adhering to the principle of "you don't kick a fallen person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The speaker notes that "hostility towards Gülen" is a common denominator between the government and the self-proclaimed opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### The "Table of Six"

The "Table of Six" is described as a "stillborn project since the day it was first established" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a> and something that was "obvious it wouldn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>.

### Meral Akşener's Strategy

The speaker suggests that Meral Akşener's (Good Party) strategy might involve:
*   Joining the government and securing a share of spoils if the MHP is on the verge of disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>.
*   Aiming for the Good Party to become the dominant right-wing party (BSP - Big Right Wing Party), replacing the AKP in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. This would involve saving itself "from the kiss of death of the Republican People's Party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a> and abandoning the "coalition will sink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:52">[01:37:52]</a>.
*   Planning to take a "bit of the right wing of the Republican People's Party and to land on the corpse of the AKP in the long run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:19]</a>.

### Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's Prospects

The speaker states, "I never believed that Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu would win the [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | elections]] and come to power through [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | elections]] and I still don't believe it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:40:04]</a>.

### HDP's Potential Role

The speaker believes it would be a "big mistake for HDP to follow this and accept being its second tire and spare tire" by allying directly with the Republican People's Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:41:14]</a>. HDP should "enter the [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | elections]] independently" with a "very strong candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:22]</a>.

HDP has the potential to grow its votes, even convincing those who previously supported other parties, unlike the CHP which lacks "such a potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:42:33]</a>. The speaker suggests HDP should aim to increase its votes to 20% and, if it reaches the second round, propose that "if the Presidency is going to be given to the CHP, the Prime Ministry should be given to Selahattin Demirtaş" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:40]</a>.

## [[political_history_of_turkey | Historical Political Context]]

### Collapse of the Ottoman Empire

The "abolition of the Ottoman government" has a clear date around "November 2, 1922 or November 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:45]</a>.
Following the conquest of Izmir and the signing of the Mudanya Armistice, an Ankara army detachment, led by Refet Pasha, arrived in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:12:18]</a>. They immediately informed ministries that they were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:32]</a>, and the official gazette published its last copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:57]</a>. Prime Minister Tevfik Pasha was notified his duty was over and forced to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:25]</a>. The Sultan, Vahdettin, was not directly notified but the palace was surrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:34]</a>. After about two weeks of waiting, Vahdettin left on a British ship from Dolmabahçe Palace early one morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:15:01]</a>.

The actual disappearance of the Ottoman government is considered to have gradually occurred between September 1919 and 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:30]</a>. After the Sivas Congress, the Ankara regime seized administration across Anatolia, removing governors and controlling military garrisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:49]</a>. The Istanbul government, led by Damat Ferit Pasha, had its hands tied by a telegraph embargo, rendering it incapable of governing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:26]</a>. Damat Ferit Pasha was later dismissed when he took his duty seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:55]</a>.

Following Damat Ferit, two short-lived military governments supportive of Ankara were established in Istanbul: Ali Rıza Pasha's government and another led by a sailor officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:16]</a>. Both resigned due to lack of Ankara's approval, leading to Tevfik Pasha, an old statesman with diplomatic background and ties to the Ottoman dynasty and Mustafa Kemal, becoming Prime Minister until November 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:19:16]</a>.

### Revolutions in Turkey

The speaker states that in Turkey, there has "never been a revolution that started with a popular uprising" like the French Revolution (1789) or the Russian Revolution (1917) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:18]</a>. The Iranian Revolutions of 1908 and 1976 are also cited as examples of popular uprisings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:39]</a>.

Popular revolutions leading to the collapse of giant state organizations are described as "black swan" incidents, unpredictable and not theoretically bounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:43]</a>. A planned, designed, and organized change movement "cannot happen" because "the inertia of the existing order... strangles it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:13">[01:58:25]</a>. Success depends on a "surprise factor" and the readiness of the environment and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:47">[01:59:08]</a>.

## [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Foreign Policy and International Relations]]

[[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkey's domestic policy]] has "always been shaped by the competition between great states and the interventions of great states since the Tanzimat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:45]</a>. It is currently one of the "most important countries in the world in the extremely dangerous, extremely risky, extremely slippery environment it is in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:24]</a>. As a NATO country, Turkey is in the "vital war between NATO and Russia" and has "followed a path closer to Russia than NATO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:37]</a>.

Turkey is also recognized as the country with the "greatest military power in the region," spanning the Balkans, Middle East, and Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:51]</a>. While historically a "colony of the Western alliance since 45," Turkey has started to deviate from this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:52:19]</a>. The speaker notes that the attitude of the opposition front regarding [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | foreign policy]] is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:50]</a>.

Foreign ambassadors in Turkey, including those from the US, Russia, EU, and Britain, are assumed to be actively involved in the country's [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:22]</a>. The speaker suggests that a significant portion of Turkey's internal security and intelligence organization was "under the control of the Americans" since the 1950s, with American agents infiltrating every cell of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:54:04]</a>. The extent of Russian organization in Turkey is unknown but logically presumed to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:29]</a>.

## National Identity and Social Dynamics

The speaker addresses the question of why some groups insist on calling all Turkish citizens "Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:25]</a>.
*   The "group that monopolizes the concept of Turk and imposes it as an element of tyranny" is identified as the "administrative staff of the republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:40]</a>.
*   This "Turkish state" has "defiles the concept of Turks, makes it a term of hostility, turns it into a war slogan against its own citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:16:02]</a>.

### Kurds and Turkish Identity

A "significant minority" of the population, specifically Kurds, have "no reason" to call themselves Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:56]</a>. They have been Kurds for 2000 years, speak a different language, and have a different culture and social memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:17:07]</a>. In their social memory, Turks have appeared as both friends/allies and enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:14]</a>. The speaker notes that Tatars and Chechens in Russia, though governed by Russians, identify as Tatars and Chechens, not Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:37]</a>.

If the Turkish state "betrays them" or "tries to humiliate them," banning their language and identity, it will later "complain about its troubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:24]</a>. This refusal to accept diverse identities leads to a "diluted fascist dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:53]</a>.

The term "Turkish" is defined not by "ethnic and genetic bond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:33]</a> but by a "social group with very clear boundaries" defined by "politics, ideology and to some extent by language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:20:32]</a>. Kurds, however, have been a "separate nation," "tribe," with "different languages," "social organization forms," "habits, manners, traditions," and "common culture tales" for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:35]</a>. The only reason they cannot exist under a separate national political identity is due to the "narrow minded bigoted and stupid policies of those who govern the Turkish state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:22:04]</a>.

### Non-Muslims and Turkish Identity

Non-Muslims in Turkey have historically "never considered themselves Turks" and viewed being called Turk as a "great insult," even "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:33]</a>. This does not mean they could not coexist or be part of the same state, but they were "not Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:47]</a>. The speaker implies that the destruction of minority elements like the Greeks after 1923 removed this problem, but the Kurds "could not destroy" and "will not be able to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:23:17]</a>. The state's discourse that it can "pass whatever we want as we want" is "not working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:32]</a>.

### Turkish Populations West and East of the Euphrates

The speaker defines Anatolia as "the peninsula called Asia Minor," extending from Adana to Samsun, west of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:54]</a>. The East of the Euphrates is "not Anatolia," but rather "Mesopotamia," "Armenia," or part of "Syria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:26:13]</a>.

When Alpaslan arrived in 1071, he conquered both Anatolia and regions east of the Euphrates, including Syria, Iraq, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:36]</a>. The east of the Euphrates had been under Muslim rule for many centuries, whereas the west was a Christian country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:50]</a>. Turkmen tribes settled in both regions in equal numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:28:16]</a>. Over the following 200-300 years, Turks did not "melt away" east of the Euphrates, but established "absolute dominance" west of the Euphrates, leading to regions like Muğla, Denizli, and Aydın becoming "completely Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:29:06]</a>. The speaker notes that a historian should examine why Turks "melted away" in the east after conquering areas like Mosul, Mardin, and Ahlat much earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:33]</a>.

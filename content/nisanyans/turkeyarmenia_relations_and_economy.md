Current economic and trade relations between [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]] and [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] are notable, with a significant presence of [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkish]] products in Armenian supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Armenian Public Opinion on Border Opening
Despite existing trade, there is a "wrong information, a mistake and an assumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> regarding the Armenian public's desire for an intensified opening of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The speaker states that the "vast majority of people in [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] are not in favor of opening the border with [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Those "against it are much more in favor of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It is a "big misunderstanding" to assume that Armenians are eager for the border to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

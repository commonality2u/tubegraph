The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire's]] past, particularly its decline, is a complex and often debated subject in Turkey. The prevailing image of the [[historical_account_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_legacy | Ottoman Empire]] in modern television series as "militarist, aggressive, and conquest-oriented" or focused on "religious common people" is far from the reality of the 17th, 18th, and especially 19th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | historical assessment of the Ottoman Empire's collapse]] reveals a unique, painful, and protracted process, distinct from the experiences of other empires in their periods of decline and modernization.

## The Ottoman Decline: A Protracted Social Destruction

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] can be broadly divided into three distinct periods, none of which are very similar to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>:
1.  **Rapid Establishment (Early Period - c. 1500s)**: An empire established with "incredible speed and incredible dynamism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. It brought a "new type of Islamic Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, distinguished by its strength and central control, with the economy largely under state oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:23]</a>. This model, attempting to learn from the "failed examples" of the Abbasid and Byzantine states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, was initially "extraordinarily successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Great Collapse (c. 1550s - 1800s)**: Despite initial success, this highly centralized model "almost brought a great collapse with an inevitable logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. As global trade directions changed and Europe rapidly gained technological and economic strength in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, the Ottoman model, akin to the Soviet model, proved "very central and very fragile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

The period from the 1570s/1580s until 1918 saw a "chain of disasters that brought fire to every household from the Danube to the Persian Gulf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, historically "one of the richest and most civilized geographies of the world," transformed into a "Stone Age" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, becoming one of the "world's poorest" regions with low literacy and high unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This was due to the collapse of the timar system (production system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, leading to villagers fleeing, increased nomadism, and widespread plunder of Anatolia by tribes from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Towns lost population, the economy collapsed, and literacy decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. European travelers in the 18th century observed Ottoman lands as places of "isolation, abandonment, destruction and poverty, civilization has ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>, a stark contrast to the 1300s, 1400s, and early 1500s when Anatolia and Rumelia were still among the richest and most urbanized regions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Regions and Empires
While Europe underwent significant industrialization and enrichment from the 12th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, the [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Ottoman Empire's decline]] was not simply a relative impoverishment compared to a rising Europe. It was a "very serious impoverishment compared to its own past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This contrasts with colonial exploitation seen in India or China, as "nothing like that happened in the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. The internal "production model collapsed, the management model collapsed, the state could not provide security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

## Failed Modernization Efforts and Elite Isolation

By the early 1800s, the [[historical_reflections_on_ottoman_empires_reforms_and_leadership | Ottoman Empire]] was "heading towards complete collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This led to a period of radical reform, particularly from Selim III and Mahmud II, with the clear model for success being Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. The logic was to "learn the languages of Europe, what is the secret of these bastards, we will learn that, we will apply the same in TÃ¼rkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. However, these [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman reforms]], despite being "very rare in the world" in their radicalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>, largely failed to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.

### Why Ottoman Modernization Differed from Japan and Russia

The [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization]] efforts are often compared to the successful westernization in Japan and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.
*   **Japan's Success**: Attributed to its "extremely homogeneous society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>, where the entire population could be considered of the same culture, ideal, state, and religion, plus its isolated island geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.
*   **Russia's Success**: While an empire of diverse tribes, Russia managed to "force a single common culture, a common ideal, a common lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a> even on conquered populations like Tatars, Georgians, and Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Failure**: The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]], conversely, was a "union established by conquest" and "tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>, with communities resisting the loss of their national or religious identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. It "could never become a nation" or a "homogeneous social entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. The [[historical_conflicts_and_events_in_the_ottoman_empire_and_greece | Greek independence]] was a turning point, as it showed that the empire was no longer sustainable when a group formed a separate political identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

### The "Surplus Value" Dilemma

The fundamental dilemma for any state is the "surplus value mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. While collecting surplus value can fund "great civilization projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>, over-exploitation leads to societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>, and under-exploitation prevents the creation of a "central culture" or state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>.

The [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Ottoman Empire]] achieved an "unprecedented level of surplus value exploitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. This initially led to incredible success but eventually led to collapse. This pattern is compared to the Soviet Union, which was also "one of the most successful surplus value exploitation mechanisms in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>, rapidly rising to a superpower before cracking due to unsustainable exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>. In the Ottoman context, this surplus value was "shared by a small group in Istanbul," while the rest of the country suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.

## Elite Conservatism and Fear of Change

From the mid-16th century, particularly during the later years of Kanuni (Suleiman the Magnificent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>, the ruling class, once vibrant and wealthy, faced economic blockage, leading to "very harsh, very bloody struggles among himself" as the "size of the pie to be shared was shrinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. This resulted in a "ruthless, very bloody central dictatorship" where internal conflicts reached "terrible levels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>.

When the primary mechanism of conquest and plunder stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>, the internal dictatorship began to shake. This led to a period where the elite adopted a conservative mentality, preferring to "live with the memories and symbols of that culture" rather than pursue wealth or radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>. This "ivory tower" mentality of the elite meant that major innovations like the printing press were delayed, as their purpose was not for general literacy or widespread learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.

A significant factor in this conservatism was the fear of shaking the existing power structure. The majority of the empire's population until the 18th century was non-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. The Ottoman state's authority rested on the "Conquest" and the idea that the Muslim minority was the "sole ruler of this country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>, while others had no share in military or administration. Shaking this system could lead to "terrible consequences" and even the "physical destruction" of the Muslim minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>. This fear of internal disintegration, as seen with the ambitions of figures like Catherine the Great to establish a new Byzantine Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>, made the [[historical_reflections_on_ottoman_empires_reforms_and_leadership | Ottoman ruling class]] very hesitant to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

The [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman reform]] process, though initiated, was a "dead end" because it "could not continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>. The established structure was so fragile that pulling out two bricks would cause it to collapse entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>. This collapse effectively occurred in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:20:00">[43:20:00]</a>, leaving Turkey to suffer the consequences today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. The transformation of a historically rich and cultured land into a "misery and a garbage dump" is seen as the "summary of the last 500 years of modern Turkish history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:08:00">[44:08:00]</a>.

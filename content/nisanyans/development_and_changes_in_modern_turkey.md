## The 100th Anniversary of the Republic

The 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic was anticipated to be marked by grand ceremonies and enthusiastic celebrations, with expectations of significant political events or even a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, these expectations were largely unmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In comparison to the 80th and 90th anniversary celebrations, the 100th was notably subdued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Efforts to link the anniversary with the propaganda of Tayyip Erdoğan, such as visiting mausoleums, were not considered serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It is evident that the government's policy aimed to render the 100th anniversary an ordinary and unimportant event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. A small group, described as a "sect or a group of disciples," attempted to generate excitement through demonstrations and social media content about Atatürk, yet the anniversary held little overall significance for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Historical Continuity vs. Radical Change

From a broader historical perspective, the Republic of Turkey is seen as an episode in a continuous process dating back to at least 1453 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

> "When you look at the general history of Turkey the Republic is an episode a period how what is it there is the Abdulhamid period Eee there is the rise period stagnation period decline period and there is also the Republic Period the fact that the name of the state has been changed seems to be an important factor but if you look at it This The name of the country among foreigners is always Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

This perspective aligns with other nations like France, Russia, and China, which underwent significant [[political_changes_in_turkey | political changes]] (e.g., monarchy to republic, or different regimes) but maintained fundamental continuities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite the change in the state's official name, the country has consistently been known as "Türkiye" to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Institutional and Identity Continuities
[[historical_continuity_in_turkey | Historical continuity]] is visible in the state's narrative, acknowledging figures like Fatih, Yavuz, Abdulhamid, Mustafa Kemal, and Tayyip Erdoğan as part of a continuous lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Institutions like the Turkish Armed Forces and the Gendarmerie Organization celebrate centennials, demonstrating a long-standing existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. State records and administrations (e.g., land registry, mapping, population) also show clear continuity, indicating that regime changes did not break the institutional framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The Republic of Turkey is considered a "revised version of the Ottoman State" adapted to modern conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The collective identity of the people has remained consistent; those who previously identified as "Muslims" largely overlap with those later called "Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. External observers (e.g., Armenians, Greeks, French, English) consistently referred to Ottoman Muslims as "Turks" regardless of their specific ethnic subgroups like Bosniaks, Albanians, or Lazs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The ruling cadres of the Republic largely originated from the elite schools and military of the old Ottoman regime, maintaining continuity in state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Many Ottoman laws, which had been reformed and rewritten based on European models since the 1840s, remained in effect during the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The Republic also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Additionally, many traditions, customs, habits, and prejudices continued from the Ottoman era into the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Turkish remained the dominant language, although significant reforms in its usage style occurred from the 1930s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Key Differences with the Republic
Despite strong continuities, two significant changes occurred with the Republic:

1.  **Shift from a Sovereign Nation to a Single Nation**: In the Ottoman State, the Muslim/Turkish segment was considered the "Sovereign Nation" among multiple coexisting nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This structure began to unravel with the Tanzimat reforms and was systematically liquidated from the late Abdulhamid period through the early Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The "cleaning" of non-Muslim elements from the Anatolian and Rumelian population, initiated in the 19th century, intensified before the Republic and continued until the 1980s, transforming the previously sovereign group into a single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This represents a deep, radical transformation in the [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | sociological structure]] of the country and the ideology of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

2.  **Expansion of Bureaucratic Cadres**: The modern state, influenced by 19th-century European developments, saw an increase in its duties and a corresponding need for a growing and diversifying bureaucratic staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This global trend, involving a significant increase in literate individuals capable of administrative tasks, was also observed in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. After a period of stagnation and conflict (1908-1923), the number of people integrated into state cadres dramatically increased, from an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. While this led to a quantitative increase in education, it also resulted in a decrease in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. These newly educated administrative segments, drawn from various parts of Anatolia and Rumelia, became loyal supporters of the Republican regime as it provided them opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. This expansion of bureaucratic roles was not unique to the Republic; it would have occurred under any regime (sultanate or communist) due to global developmental trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

### Revolutionary Excitement and its Outcome
In the 1920s and 1930s, Turkey's administrative cadres were swept by a "great revolutionary excitement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This stemmed from the collapse of the old regime and the state's subsequent resurgence, fostering a belief in opening a new, successful chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. This sentiment was also prevalent globally after World War I, with a desire to rebuild institutions on rational foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. However, the speaker suggests that this idealism, which lasted until the 1940s, largely resulted in "much talk and little action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

Comparisons are drawn to [[modernization_efforts_in_turkish_history | modernization efforts]] in Russia under Catherine the Great (18th century) and Stalin (20th century), where massive mobilization, often through force, led to the creation of modern infrastructure, cities, and cultural institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. While Turkey also aimed to reach the level of contemporary civilization from 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>, the initial enthusiasm faded, especially after 1938-1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. The reforms implemented were seen as superficial, and the administrative cadres were deemed insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. A significant portion of the Republic's founding generation acquired wealth and power through the plunder associated with the elimination of non-Muslims, prioritizing the protection of these gains over revolutionary ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. The speaker argues that the inadequacy of these administrative cadres, rather than societal backwardness, explains why transformative efforts failed to achieve results comparable to those in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

### Change in Head of State Election Method
The Republic's most specific and distinct change was the method of electing the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. Historically, a strong, hereditary leader was deemed necessary for governing large states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. However, this monarchical model collapsed globally, particularly after World War I, in countries like Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, as well as China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. The "fashion of the age," driven by new social structures and ideological trends, led to the principle that a head of state could be chosen by elites and approved, even if superficially, by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.

The speaker notes that while republics theoretically involve periodic elections, this ideal was not always realized in Turkey or other countries, where leaders like Mustafa Kemal Pasha remained in power for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The actual impact of this change in management technique on real-world results is considered minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. The speaker argues that changes like decreased child mortality, increased life expectancy, population growth, improved public health, higher literacy rates, urbanization, and increased university graduates are global phenomena unrelated to a country's governmental structure (monarchy or republic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. These developments are attributed to the "era brought" by new state understandings, increased state influence, advancements in transportation and communication, and the astronomical need for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

## Ankara as a Capital City

Ankara was not established "from nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. In the early 20th century, it was one of Central Anatolia's largest cities, alongside Kayseri and Konya, and possibly the most developed among them, with a population of 40,000-50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. Ankara is an ancient city, a major center since Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. The Keçiören neighborhood, founded by Catholic Armenians around 1910, was a unique example of modern planned urban development in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

Ankara's economic importance stemmed from its near-monopoly on mohair, a significant export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. The arrival of the Anatolian railway in 1880 further spurred its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. The existence of this already developed and strategically located city likely contributed to its selection as the headquarters for the national struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

Other examples of cities created "from nothing" include Saint Petersburg, founded in a swamp by royal decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Historically, many Eastern dynasties established new, planned capitals, often with a clear hierarchy from royal buildings to common neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. Istanbul itself, though a city existed before, was monumentally rebuilt by Constantine in 325 AD with the aim of being a world capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. Elazığ, founded as a military garrison and administrative center during Sultan Abdulaziz's reign in the 1860s, is another example of a city built from scratch in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## The 1990s in Turkey
The 1990s in Turkey were significantly shaped by [[turkish_political_developments_and_changes_in_government | political developments and changes in government]]. Starting from the mid-1980s, a movement associated with Özal's policies brought a sense of liberalism and integration with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This era emphasized making money, enjoying life, embracing international travel, and following new trends, fostering an optimistic outlook among the middle and upper classes, especially in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. There was a dominant feeling that Turkey would integrate with the European Union and overcome the "dark ideological obsessions" of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. The boundaries of press freedom and freedom of expression were perceived to be expanding daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

However, this optimism slowly gave way to pessimism by the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>. The Kurdish issue escalated dramatically in 1993, leading to a terror campaign, deportation policies in Eastern provinces, destruction of villages, forced migration, and the assassination of Kurdish intellectuals and businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. The military, which had been withdrawing from politics, re-entered the political life with tyranny and oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. This "dark period" intensified throughout the 1990s, eventually leading to the collapse of the existing political party system and the rise of the Justice and Development Party around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>. The 1990s are summarized as not being a good period for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

## Official Ideology vs. Real History
The speaker notes an intense public interest in nuanced historical topics, especially those concerning [[urbanization_and_cultural_adaptation_in_turkey | Turkish history and identity]], which often contradict standard narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. The standard discourses about Turkey's past and identity are characterized as "stupid lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. People often feel a disconnect between family narratives and school teachings, seeking to resolve these contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>.

The official ideology imposes a unified national identity, denying the country's true history of ethnic and cultural divisions, clashes, and rivalries within and between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. This official narrative attempts to squeeze complex historical realities into a simplistic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. Unveiling even small local truths behind this official curtain is considered a revolutionary act that challenges the established narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

## Freedom of Expression in Turkey
Regarding freedom of expression in Turkey, beyond just insulting the president, the situation is described as very narrow and restrictive concerning religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. There's a "restriction area" where one can easily get into trouble for spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. Additionally, there is strong political control in the media, and due to lower standards of decency and legal standards compared to Western countries, any word that doesn't align with the administration or powerful figures is very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Stance
Turkey is aware of a serious threat of war and likely aims to stay out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>. This is reflected in its clear messaging to both sides, exemplified by the President organizing a Palestine rally while Turkish warships participate in NATO fleets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. Turkey's probable strategy is to maintain a friendly facade with all parties to avoid involvement in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. If a new Palestinian order were to be established, Turkey seeks a role as a guarantor, patron, or supporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>, although this is deemed difficult to achieve as the Arab world would likely not accept such a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

The historical portrayal of rulers is often characterized by formulaic descriptions and eulogies rather than objective accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This phenomenon is observed across various historical periods and empires, including the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, and medieval Turkish states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Role of Historians

Historians in ancient and medieval times often shaped their narratives to serve specific political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This could involve presenting a ruler as an exemplary figure or, conversely, vilifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For example, if a sultan was disliked, his portrayal might emphasize negative traits like dishonesty, immorality, cruelty, or irreligiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Case Study: Fatih Sultan Mehmet

Information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet from Turkish Ottoman sources is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While works like Aşıkpaşazade's history and other Ottoman dynastic works were produced, especially towards the end of Fatih's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, the official historical accounts are ambiguous and reflect a complex attitude towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Fatih Sultan Mehmet was not a widely beloved Sultan, particularly in the later years of his rule, and was often associated with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He suppressed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, confiscating their property and executing many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. His 30-year reign was characterized by continuous warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

More detailed insights into Fatih Sultan Mehmet come from Byzantine historians such as Halkondylis and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These historians lived during his time, met him personally, and were aware of the affairs within his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Political Agendas in Historical Accounts

Accounts of rulers, even those seemingly laudatory, often serve political or diplomatic agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For instance, historians with close ties to Italian states like Genoa and Venice might have written about Fatih Sultan Mehmet to facilitate alliances or rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy, considering the complex international relations of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

In this context, statements describing Fatih Sultan Mehmet as an intellectual, cultured, or omniscient individual, or drawing [[comparisons_between_fatih_sultan_mehmet_and_renaissance_rulers | comparisons to Renaissance rulers]] of Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, might reflect these diplomatic realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Similarly, claims of him knowing Latin and Italian, or being aware of Christianity, should be critically examined for their underlying motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Challenges in Assessing Historical Accounts

It is difficult to ascertain the truth of statements made about sultans and state administrators, as such information was often disseminated through official channels or "buffets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These "cliché words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, whether in praise or criticism, tend to be pre-fabricated phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Examples include descriptions like "very religious," "personally seen him pray to God in secret," "a poet," or claims that he "made the architectural drawings of all his big projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

It is challenging for modern historians to gain a realistic and objective picture of past rulers, even more so for those from 500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The fundamental question for a historian is not *if* a statement is true, but *why* it was said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

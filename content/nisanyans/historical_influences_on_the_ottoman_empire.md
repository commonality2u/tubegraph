The Ottoman Empire, particularly in its later periods, was shaped by various internal and external influences, demographic shifts, and its relationship with its historical predecessors.

## The End of an Era and Continuity with the Republic

The [[historical_analysis_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_decline | Ottoman Empire]] ended both legally and de facto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A significant aspect of the transition to the Republic of Turkey was the continuity of state cadres. The overwhelming majority of state cadres, excluding the very top executive positions, continued their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. This meant that land registry directors, police chiefs, and military court judges from the Ottoman era largely remained in their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. There was a 180% to 90% continuity between the state order of the Ottoman Empire and the state order of the Republic, with the same cadres continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

The political cadres of the Republic, including deputies, politicians, party leaders, and organizers, had largely been organized around the Union and Progress movement since 1908, particularly from 1913 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. Many of these key political figures were later purged or forced into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. However, the administrative cadres of the Union and Progress continued into the Republic period as deputies, ministers, founders and managers of the People's Party, and ambassadors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

Some high bureaucrats and pashas from the old period who had no direct relation with Union and Progress retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. Notable figures like Ahmet İzzet Pasha, Ali Rıza Pasha, and Salih Hulusi Pasha, all former soldiers and Grand Viziers, received their retirement salaries from the Ottoman period and lived quiet lives in Istanbul until the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

## Late Ottoman Decline and Society

The period after 1890 in the Ottoman Empire, specifically during the later years of Sultan Abdulhamid's reign, was characterized by stagnation and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. A deep silence permeated the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>, leading educated people to despise the country and seek emigration to places like Paris or Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. Egypt, at that time, was experiencing a cultural, intellectual, and economic breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

There was a strong perception that Egypt and the Ottomans were exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. The circulation of blood in the managerial cadres of the Ottoman Empire had stopped, with few new people entering management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. This led to the aging, increasing corruption, and eventual decay of the governing cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. The [[social_and_economic_changes_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] presented the appearance of a "Miskinler Tekke" (Dervish Lodge of the Poor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

By the last year of Abdulhamid's regime in 1908, almost everyone in Türkiye, regardless of their background (Turkish, non-Muslim, Westernist, Ottomanist, Kurdish), had given up hope, believing the Ottoman Empire was not going anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Qualified and educated cadres were either imprisoned, exiled, or assigned to remote, insignificant posts within the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. The Abdulhamid regime ultimately collapsed with a single telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

### Abdulhamid's Reforms and Their Failure

Sultan Abdulhamid II came to power in 1876 during a significant crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. He made great efforts in his early years to revive the empire through conservative measures, believing that education was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. His regime initiated an unprecedented mobilization in middle school and high school education across Türkiye and established a law school and a university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. He also developed the medical field, establishing a rabies and microbiology hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. These [[historical_discussions_on_ottoman_empire_reforms | reforms]] were serious attempts to modernize the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

Abdulhamid believed that excessive politicization was detrimental and sought to centralize power, running the country personally from the palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. His reforms, reminiscent of Tayyip Erdoğan's and Mustafa Kemal Pasha's early years, ultimately failed as he realized the country's fabric and the international arena no longer allowed for such a centralized, politically suppressed system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. The attempt to fix the country solely with bureaucratic or technocratic methods, by banning politics, led to stagnation and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. By the end of his 33-year reign, his system was universally cursed within the Ottoman country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.

## Ottoman-Byzantine Continuity

The Ottoman Empire can be increasingly viewed as the "return of the Rum" or the "resurrection of the Rum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>, referring to the Byzantine state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>. The Ottomans, with new staff and ideology, were remixed with a new mortar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a>.

Byzantium had lost control of Anatolia and Rumelia starting from the 7th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. After a dark period, there was a revival outside Byzantine control in both Anatolia and the Balkans during the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. This era saw cultural flowering, the founding of new cities and towns, monument construction, and trade development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. A political structure of independent principalities and local governments dominated, especially in the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.

Byzantium's inability to manage this structure was primarily due to the church institution's excessive power, which blocked the economy by holding vast, idle lands and economic values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>. This led to Byzantium's financial depletion and gradual collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>. When the Turks became dominant in Anatolia and captured Byzantium, they attributed its downfall to the church's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56">[01:30:56]</a>.

In 1453, a new political formation, the "Byzantium of the Turks," was established in the old capital of Byzantium, which then captured Anatolia and the Balkans, encompassing all the old Byzantine lands and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. This ushered in a short period of great economic and cultural revival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. These [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | historical perspectives on Ottoman and Byzantine contexts]] suggest a deeper connection than simple conquest.

## Societal and Ethnic Influences

In the early 20th century, Muslim [[historical_perspectives_on_turkish_conquest_of_anatolia | Ottoman society]] (Turks) was demoralized, having largely lost its military capabilities and will to fight and survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. However, two "living elements" persisted:

1.  **Circassians and other Caucasian immigrants**: Expelled from their homelands in the 1860s and 70s, they were embraced by Turkey, fostering a strong sense of gratitude towards the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. Their experiences in the Caucasus instilled a determination to fight against non-Muslims and foreign powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. They were armed and eager for conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>, playing a significant role in conflicts like the Greco-Turkish War (1919) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Their loyalty shifted between the Sultan and the Ankara government during the Turkish War of Independence, leading to a painful period until 1927-28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>, but ultimately they proved their loyalty to the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. They had a strong tradition of armed tribal organization and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>.
2.  **Balkan Turks, Cretan, and Rumelian Turks**: These groups, having experienced the disaster of expulsion from their homelands, were determined to prevent similar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. They were also active in resistance, though their armed organizational tradition was weaker compared to the Circassians, as they were primarily a peasant and urban population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

### Other Influential Groups

*   **Black Sea people**: They possess a tradition of conflict, stemming from their isolated settlements where self-protection with weapons was common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. Due to economic difficulties in the Eastern Black Sea region, they formed a large diaspora in Istanbul and Western cities, developing a "Black Sea mafia" culture of solidarity and group interest protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. This made them highly influential in politics and state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.
*   **Kurds**: Especially since 1993 and into the 2000s, Kurds gained unprecedented influence and power in Türkiye's major cities and Western provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. Despite historical state discrimination and exclusion from the bureaucracy, Kurds are disproportionately reaching key political positions through a top-down method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

These four groups – Circassians, Rumelian immigrants, Black Sea people, and Kurds – have significantly shaped the [[impact_of_major_historical_figures_on_turkish_politics | social history of the Republic of Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>.

### Cultural and Social Norms

Historically, bisexuality was openly acknowledged in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the 17th and 19th centuries, appearing to have completely taken over the culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Accounts suggest that love poems for women were considered ridiculous, while those for men were natural and acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

Regarding names, until the 19th century, a large portion of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire had Turkish names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>. With the rise of national consciousness and education in the 19th century, they abandoned Turkish names for pure Armenian or Christian saint names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>. Similarly, Jews in the Ottoman Empire, who largely spoke Ladino (a Spanish slur specific to Sephardic Jews), often had Hebrew, Spanish, or distinct Turkish names. For example, the name "Kadın" (Woman) was common among older generations of Jews, but pronounced "Kaden," making their Jewish identity clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:25">[02:00:25]</a>. After 1920, there was a trend among Jews to use Western names that offered camouflage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. These naming patterns reflect [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | historical and architectural influences between Türkiye and its neighbors]] and within its diverse population.

## The "Greengrocer" (Manav) Identity

The term "Greengrocer" (Manav) refers to the local Muslims living in the South Marmara region, encompassing parts of Bursa, Balıkesir, Bilecik, Sakarya, Kocaeli, and Eskişehir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>. This term distinguishes them from the large numbers of people who migrated to the region from Rumelia, the Caucasus, and the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>.

Research on Manav culture and history suggests that a significant portion of them were originally Rums (Byzantine subjects) in the early 15th or 14th century, who became Muslims under Turkish rulers and adopted a new culture under the leadership of Turkish timar owners and foundation managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>. A strong substratum infrastructure remains from their Greek origin, evident in some traditions, ceremonies, and cultural characteristics that cannot be explained otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:33">[01:52:33]</a>. Many Manav villages contain ruins of old churches (500-600 years old), with no historical record of a population change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:46">[01:52:46]</a>. This indicates that at least partially, Manavs have Byzantine Greek origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:18">[01:53:18]</a>. The speaker asserts that "being Turkish is something that is done," meaning it is a process of Turkification rather than a fixed ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>.

The names of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are known to have been recorded as early as 2000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It is believed that these names likely predate this recorded date significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Etymological Speculations
The origin of the names of these two rivers remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. There are various theories attempting to explain their etymology within the framework of both Semitic and Iranian languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Connection to King Tigran and Tigranocerta
The name "Tigris" has been linked to King Tigran, who ruled parts of modern-day southeastern [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | Türkiye]] and Syria in the first century BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This means King Tigran lived at least 2,000 years after the rivers were named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

King Tigran established a city, sometimes referred to as "Aker," and made it his capital after conquering these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This city, often called Tigranocerta, existed for a short period before being subdued by the Romans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Location of Tigranocerta
The exact location of Tigranocerta is uncertain, with a suggestion emerging in the 19th century that it was Diyarbakır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. However, there is no basis for this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Historians define its likely location as near Kurtalan, along the Garzan River, on a wide and flat hill between Kozluk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The probability of Tigranocerta being Diyarbakır is well below zero, while its location as a ruin along the Garzan River is stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

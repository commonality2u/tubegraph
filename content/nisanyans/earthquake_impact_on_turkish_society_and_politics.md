The **2023 [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]** significantly impacted **[[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkish society and politics]]**, leading to shifts in public sentiment, political discourse, and governance decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Societal Response and Trauma
The speaker notes that people have slowly begun to overcome the initial trauma of the [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Discussions, however, have largely reverted to long-standing, unchanging debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Political Repercussions
The **[[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]** has had a profound effect on **[[Turkish politics and elections | Turkish politics]]**, particularly concerning the speaker's view of President [[Impact of major historical figures on Turkish politics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and the upcoming elections.

### Shifting Political Stance
The speaker's personal antipathy towards [[Impact of major historical figures on Turkish politics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] significantly increased after the [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]], reaching an "unbearable point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Prior to the [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]], the speaker's voting tendency was split 50-50, with a slight leaning towards [[Impact of major historical figures on Turkish politics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] (51% for Erdoğan, 49% for Kılıçdaroğlu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. After the [[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]], the speaker felt "Enough is enough" and the needle turned the other way, shifting to 51% for Kılıçdaroğlu and 49% for Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This perspective, however, has recently been shaken again by the opposition's perceived repetitive and empty rhetoric on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Election Postponement
The speaker believes that the upcoming election has been "shelved" and should not be anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. If elections are postponed once against the Constitution, it establishes a precedent for repeated postponements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The speaker questions who would resist such a move, suggesting that Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu would not, nor would the people rise up against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### School Closures
The closure of schools is considered a very serious and dangerous move, potentially indicating a shift into "war mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. This action suggests a concern about possible political or regime coups, or turmoil originating from universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## Long-term Consequences

### [[Migration and demographic changes in Trkiye postearthquake | Internal Migration]]
The **[[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]** is expected to cause a very large-scale [[migration_and_demographic_changes_in_trkiye_postearthquake | internal migration]], potentially affecting 5 to 10 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. If Turkey cannot manage this internal movement, it could lead to outward [[migration_and_demographic_changes_in_trkiye_postearthquake | migration]] as people seek new lives elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. The speaker notes that Turkey is still recovering from the social shocks of the 1993 displacement of approximately 1 million Kurds, suggesting this new crisis is even larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

### Economic and Security Challenges
The state budget has been seriously impacted by the **[[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. How Turkey will cope with such a massive undertaking is a significant question mark, particularly regarding security problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

### Criticism of the Opposition and Intellectual Class
The speaker criticizes the "expert, educated, intellectual, civilized" group in Turkey, claiming they are incapable of perceiving the truth due to political or class hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This group has not learned from past failures and has become "more and more stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The speaker suggests that a major reason for [[Impact of major historical figures on Turkish politics | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s 21-year success in power is the lack of a credible alternative opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This opposition is described as a "scarecrow" with no vision, excitement, or ability to instill hope, and its leadership is suspected of "playing a double game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Furthermore, the speaker suggests that the Turkish educated class is unable to provide moral leadership or guidance on basic human issues like love, livelihood, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Their entire culture and psychology are seen as based on class hatred, viewing a large portion of society as "not human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. This mindset is reflected in their attitude towards the **[[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]**, where the underlying idea is "Oh this... Because of dirty people, everything happens to us like that. Let them die and become homeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Foreign Aid for Disaster Relief
A journalist's suggestion for post-earthquake recovery involved pairing each of the ten affected provinces with a "friendly country" like the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, or Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The speaker criticizes this list for its exclusive focus on Western nations, highlighting that in the last 10-20 years, large infrastructure projects globally (e.g., in Georgia, Sri Lanka, Africa) are overwhelmingly undertaken by China with generous loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. Other significant investors include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with Russia also playing a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. European nations, conversely, are described as "bankrupt" since 2008, having little to offer beyond chain markets and stingy, short-term profit-driven investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. America is seen primarily as a seller of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. The speaker expresses anger at the "ignorance" of failing to include non-Western countries in a list of potential helpers for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The speaker emphasizes the need to seriously consider the consequences of the **[[Trkiye and Syria earthquake of 2023 | earthquake]]** that occurred on February 6, as they are understood to be very serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

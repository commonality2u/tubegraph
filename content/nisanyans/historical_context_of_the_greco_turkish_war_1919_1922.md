The period between 1919 and 1922, often referred to as the [[Historical conflicts and events in the Ottoman Empire and Greece | War of Independence]], involved significant military operations and diplomatic maneuvers between Greece and Turkey.

## Initial Greek Presence in Izmir and Ayvalık (1919)

In 1919, Greece was promised the province of Izmir and the district of Ayvalık on the international platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. At the Paris Peace Conference, it was decided that Greece, as one of the allied countries, would land troops in Izmir and Ayvalık to maintain public order in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This was described as a "police operation," not an annexation, with no intention for Greece to claim these places as their own or raise their flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The objective was also to provide a safe haven for Greek refugees who had been deported by Turks from the entire Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Izmir and Ayvalık were to be included in Greece's security area until a peace treaty was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] (1920)

The [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]], signed in 1920, was considered a "very strange text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It envisaged a five-year occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, followed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The implicit understanding was that after this five-year transition, Izmir and Ayvalık would be ceded to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, the Treaty of Sevres was a "stillborn treaty" as no one signed it, effectively making it a "bargaining document" or "threatening document" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Greek Military Operations (1920-1921)

Separate from the initial landings, the "Greek Operation" intensified in 1920 and 1921 with two major waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The Greek Army extended beyond the borders of Izmir province, invading areas like Nazilli, Bursa, and Aydın <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In a second wave, they reached the Sakarya River with the aim of capturing Ankara, but they were halted there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The objective of these larger military campaigns was not the annexation of Western Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Instead, it was a "punitive operation" designed to compel the movement in Ankara to surrender, or at least to negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The goal was to force the Ankara government to accept the [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] (or amended versions) or to eliminate the Ankara government entirely and deal directly with Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory

If the Greek forces had successfully captured Ankara and forced the surrender of the Ankara government, led by Mustafa Kemal, the following scenarios were likely:
*   A new London Conference would have been convened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   The [[Impact of the Treaty of Sevres on Greco Turkish relations | Treaty of Sevres]] would have been reformulated to reflect the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Izmir and the Aegean coast might have been ceded to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   A "consortium management" or "collective management" would have been formed in Istanbul, including Greek involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Geopolitical Implications
A Greek victory would have significantly shifted the balance of power among the major powers involved in the [[Role of major powers in the Greco Turkish conflict | Greco-Turkish conflict]]:
*   The victory of the Greeks would have meant that the British would become the sole dominant diplomatic player regarding [[TurkeyGreece relations and geopolitical tensions | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   This would have led to an "endless and bottomless conflict" between France and England, with Italy aligning with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Turkish Response to Defeat
Even if defeated, the Turkish population, which formed the overwhelming majority of the country, would not have remained passive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Türkiye possessed a highly developed administrative class, including officers, military and civil academy graduates, governors, ministers, journalists, and professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. They would have engaged in a long-term struggle, gradually seeking to regain control through economic, social, political, propaganda, and organizational means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The likely British approach would have been to use Greece as leverage against Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. A British-ruled Turkey, similar to Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, or Austria at the time, would have joined the "avengers' camp," seeking revenge for perceived injustices from the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Such a Turkey would likely have aligned with Germany in 1938-39, potentially altering the entire history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Military Realities and Expectations (1922)

Despite the Greek advances, the possibility of a Greek victory in 1921 or 1922 was not taken seriously by contemporaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   In terms of soldier numbers, the Greek army and the re-established Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) army in 1922 were roughly comparable, around 190,000-200,000 mutually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   However, Türkiye's population was 4 to 5 times larger than Greece's at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   Türkiye's economy was at least 3 times larger than Greece's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

These factors meant that while short-term battles could go either way, a long-term war would inevitably be won by Türkiye due to its superior resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. There was no chance of Greece winning a war against Türkiye that lasted longer than one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Furthermore, the Turkish army possessed a centuries-old military and weapon tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, and the political population in the Aegean Region was overwhelmingly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Greece's only chance for victory was a swift, decisive operation, heavily supported financially and militarily by England, to quickly dismantle the unorganized Ankara government before it could establish a defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Once the war dragged on and became a frontal conflict, particularly after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece had no chance of success. This reality was understood by the British, French, and the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

A group tour to [[autumn_in_montenegro_and_travel_tours_to_georgia_and_armenia | Georgia and Armenia]] is being organized for October, upon public request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Tour Dates and Rationale
The most suitable dates chosen for the tour, considering flights and other factors, are a departure on October 11th and a return on October 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. While the week of October 29th might be more suitable for many, the end of October brings "very dark winter" conditions to these countries, making the earlier date more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

### Safety in Armenia and Georgia
Both Armenia and Georgia are considered "extremely safe," "extremely comfortable," and "extremely civilized" countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Visitors can expect to be "welcomed only with a smile and hospitality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. While Georgia was considered "the Wild West" in the 1990s with reports of robberies, it has since "met civilization" and is now safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

The speaker expresses anticipation for the trip, drawing a parallel to a successful and unforgettable trip to Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>. They assure participants that "this journey will be a very nice journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:49">[02:01:49]</a>, promising to share much about culture, history, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Conflicting Historical Narratives and Cultural Sensitivities

A recent incident involving a Greek singer, Despina Vandi, performing in front of Atatürk's portraits highlights the complexities of [[cultural_and_historical_discourse_on_ataturkism_and_turkish_society | Atatürkism]] and [[perception_of_historical_and_religious_narratives_in_trkiye | historical narratives]] in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. From the perspective of Pontic Greeks, Mustafa Kemal is viewed as the person responsible for the Pontic massacre, including mass killings, robberies, rapes, and deportations to concentration camps that occurred after his arrival in Samsun in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Inviting a popular Pontic Greek artist to perform in front of Atatürk's portraits risks ending her artistic career, as she would be perceived as a traitor in her own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The organizers, the Turk Education Foundation, were also involved in a match scandal in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This raises questions about whether such incidents are due to ignorance or a conscious attempt to create diplomatic clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The speaker suggests it appears more like a "stupid incident" than a conscious program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### The Symbolic Use of Atatürk

The figure of Atatürk, or rather the "object called Atatürk," is used symbolically in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. For example, a political figure like Mustafa Sarıgül, when facing a scandal, was seen posing in front of Atatürk with a selfie stick, attempting to "cover up his [ __ ] with Atatürk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. This behavior is considered "fantastic" and "unprecedented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. The speaker suggests that understanding the absurdity of this behavior can "solve all the secrets of Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. This practice is likened to hoisting the Turkish flag on illegal construction to deter police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.

## Debating Identity and Ancestry

Discussions around historical and [[historical_narratives_on_turkish_and_regional_identities_including_the_origins_of_certain_ethnic_groups | ethnic identities]] frequently arise in Türkiye.

### The Hunnic-Turkish Connection

The question of whether the Huns were Turkish is often raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. The term "Hun" can refer to two distinct groups: an empire in East Mongolia before Christ (Kun) and a group of looters in Hungary and Eastern Europe 500-600 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. The connection between these two groups is largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

Analysis of personal names of Huns who invaded Europe shows about half are Turkish, with others being Mongolian, Gothic, or Germanic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. While the Huns had a god called Tengri, it is uncertain whether Tengri was originally Turkish or adopted from the Huns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. The academic consensus is that there is no definitive answer on whether ancient Huns were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. It is also challenging to understand ancient states using modern nation-state concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. The speaker asserts that theses claiming the Huns were Turkish (or not Turkish) are "empty talk" due to a lack of definitive knowledge about dominant clans, organizations, and languages used both privately and publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

### The Myth of the "Aryan Race" in Turkish Context

The idea of "blond and blue-eyed Yörüks from Keles" being linked to an "Aryan race" is dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. The speaker states "there is no such thing as an Aryan race" and that racial factors play no role in human societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. Humanity naturally mixes intensely due to various factors like military service, civil wars, trade, and intermarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. Examining any family's lineage would reveal "40 different mixtures" rather than a pure "Aryan race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

### Armenian Identity and Cultural Assimilation

An example from a village in Adana shows how diverse groups can adopt a single identity. In the early 20th century, 300 Armenian households in Tufan Bey's village had surnames indicating origins from Dagestan, Arab lands, and even French crusader times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. Despite varied origins, these people became Armenians, lived with that identity, and passed it on to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. This illustrates how individuals from different nations can integrate and embrace a new [[examination_of_ethnic_and_cultural_identity_in_turkey | cultural identity]].

## Language and Cultural Transmission

### The Sogdian Language (Soca) and its Influence

Sogdian (Soca) was an Eastern Iranian language, different from Persian and Kurdish, and had no relation to Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. It served as the public language of Bukhara and Samarkand before Turks spread into Turkestan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>. Tons of Sogdian texts found in China confirm its detailed knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:23">[01:29:23]</a>.

Sogdian was the trade language of inner Asia between China and the West, with merchants reaching as far as Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:21">[01:33:21]</a>. Sogdians also adopted Buddhism and produced significant Buddhist works that influenced some Central Asian tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

Regarding its influence on Turkish, about a dozen Sogdian words entered Turkish, such as "debt" (sadan) and "woman"/"hatun" (hatın) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>. The first Göktürk Khanate (a Turkish state) used Sogdian as their literacy and liturgical language, and their khans did not have Turkish names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. Sogdians had their own script derived from the Aramaic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. While the first Turkish script (Göktürk script) was rarely used, the Uyghurs adopted a version of the Sogdian alphabet, which was later passed on to the Mongols, forming their vertical writing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Sogdian identity largely disappeared, with people becoming Turkified or Persianized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>.

## Cultural Practices and Social Evolution

### Naming Conventions

The freedom to name children as parents wish, implemented in France and Türkiye, has unexpected consequences for [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>. In France, until the early 1990s, names were restricted to the Catholic religious calendar, aligning with the practice in Greece where "name days" (saint's feast days) are celebrated instead of birthdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. This traditional system provided a fixed and universal repertoire of names, fostering a sense of societal homogeneity and egalitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>.

However, since deregulation, children born in France often have "freak names" that carry a class stamp, allowing one to infer the parents' social class and fashion trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:21">[02:41:21]</a>. The speaker argues that this freedom of naming leads to the destruction of [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural homogeneity]] and the theoretical sense of equality that binds a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. In Türkiye, a law change around 2006-2008 allowed any name, including foreign ones (with Turkish letters, no X, W, V, Q, or numbers/formulas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. The speaker believes this is not a good thing, as it alienates society from its customs, traditions, and continuities, and breaks the bond between generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>.

### Treasure Hunting Psychosis

Treasure hunting is an unchanging agenda in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. The pervasive assumption among locals that anyone exploring a region is looking for treasure is described as a "psychosis" and "mental illness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. This phenomenon is seen as a "manifestation of the Conquest psychosis," reflecting a deep-seated feeling that "this country was not our land," and a desire to "seize the product of the labor of other societies that we usurped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>. Despite countless stories of people finding treasure and getting rich, the speaker has never met anyone who actually did, concluding these are just "legends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>. This topic is considered one of the most important research areas for Türkiye's national culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

## Türkiye's Role in International Relations and its Consequences

The speaker discusses the 1974 Cyprus landing, which is celebrated in Türkiye today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>. While Türkiye had justified reasons to intervene, Greece and the international system also had their own justifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>. Türkiye's decision to act was "very brave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. However, it violated the fundamental principle of the post-1945 world order: the immutability of borders, which was considered a sacred rule by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>.

Since 1974, Türkiye has faced systematic punishment, including troubles hindering its dream of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>. The Armenian Genocide issue, dormant for 50-60 years, was also "revived and put forward" because of the Cyprus incident, creating a persistent challenge for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>. The speaker concludes that the Cyprus landing was a "very big mistake" in the long run, as Türkiye has yet to legalize the actual situation in Cyprus even after 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>. This serves as a reminder that foreign policy adventures require significant strength, and bluffing with weak cards can lead to prolonged difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

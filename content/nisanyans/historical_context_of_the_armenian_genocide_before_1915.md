From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The [[armenian_genocide | Armenian incident]], specifically the events of 1915, is described not merely as a single event, but as "the final blow of a massacre, expulsion, usurpation and collapse process that has been going on for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is characterized as a "finishing move" in a longer historical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | The Kurdish Role]] in Pre-1915 Persecution

In the period leading up to 1915, the primary oppressor of Armenians, which led them to "get tired of their lives and flee their homeland," was identified as the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Kurds, particularly those under the control of Kurdish tribal leaders and later sect sheikhs, were described as "experts in killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This established a "tradition of massacre and extortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Armenian Reliance on the Ottoman State

For a significant period, "until the last quarter of the 19th century," Armenians consistently "preferred to see the Turks, that is, the Ottoman State, as their allies and protectors against the Kurds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It was "typical" for Armenians to seek refuge and assistance from the Ottoman governor when facing attacks from Kurdish aghas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## The 1915 Event as an Annihilation Project

While the Kurds were historically involved in the persecution of Armenians, the 1915 events are distinct. This period is described as "a program taken and carried out by the Union and Progress administration of the Turkish state and the Ottoman state bureaucracy with a conscious and cold-blooded decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It was not a pogrom but an "annihilation project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The objective was to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem that had been a problem for the Ottomans for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For this, the Turkish state utilized the Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish people as "allies and as helpers and subcontractors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, leveraging the existing "tradition of massacre and extortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The state's implicit message to Kurds was, "Okay, friends, you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Evolving [[history_and_dynamics_of_turkisharmenian_relations | Kurdish Perspectives]]

Research indicates a strong animosity towards the Armenian Church rather than solely the Armenian nation around 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. After a certain point, potentially around the abolition of a high school in 1880, as the opportunities for looting and taking concubines diminished, Kurds reportedly "came to their senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, realizing they would then face the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. In recent decades, particularly over the last 20-30 years, the "attitude and approach of the Kurds towards the Armenian issue has changed radically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This shift is seen as a positive development, suggesting that Turks should also overcome their prejudices and ignorance, similar to the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The speaker discusses various aspects of publishing and the book market in Turkey, drawing on personal experiences and observations regarding the accessibility of knowledge and the quality of publications.

## Personal Publishing Projects

The speaker is in the process of creating a compilation book from past Sunday chats and "Samos exiles," which, with the suggestion of his publishing house, is yielding an "incredible amount of material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He notes that half of the material is discarded, and the rest is corrected, summarized, and shortened, resulting in an estimated 8-9 volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Another project mentioned is an "application dictionary" translation, which was his previous undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The publishing house initially moved quickly with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, but the speaker decided it needed one or two more readers before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He expects it to be published within the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

A long-forgotten project, a "dictionary of books," was reminded to him by a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This idea, first mentioned in 2020, was conceived as a comprehensive guide offering 3-sentence descriptions of each book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, the project is currently unrealistic because the speaker lacks access to his old library in Åžirince and its materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, making it difficult to recall information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## State of Turkish Books and Intellectualism

The speaker addresses the question of whether one can become an intellectual by reading only Turkish books, stating that it's "difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Quantity vs. Quality

While there are "a lot of Turkish books on the market," and bookstores, especially second-hand ones, are full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, allowing one to find many books and a "wide spectrum of information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, the speaker notes a significant disparity in production volume compared to English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For every 100 books published in English, roughly 3 are published in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Challenges in Translation and Scope

The smaller market in Turkey means that "marginal books," those appealing to a small number of people, are considered "risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Books that are "outside the ordinary and the mass" are generally not translated into Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The speaker describes Turkish book production itself as "quite miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A significant issue is the poor quality of translations, which are often "unreadable," making it hard to understand the original meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This means that an individual limited to Turkish faces a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Specialized and Historical Publications

Despite the general challenges, there have been many good publications in recent years concerning [[Historical context and analysis of Turkish literature and culture | Turkish history]] and [[Historical context and analysis of Turkish literature and culture | Turkish literature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This trend started with Kitabevi Publishing House, and other publishers are also releasing interesting works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The Turkish Language and History Institutions have also begun producing more "proper, interesting and noteworthy works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. High-quality translations from old writings have also emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

An example given is the "Kamus dictionary," a "magnificent 6-volume Arabic-Turkish dictionary" from the early 19th century, which the speaker reads "like a novel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Such publications, which were unthinkable 5-10 years ago, now appear frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, this progress is in a "very narrow specialization subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Broader Intellectual Engagement

For those interested in global events and "bright ideas" that show the "direction" of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, rather than just [[challenges_faced_by_trkiye_in_establishing_a_regional_influence | Turkey]], the speaker states that living in Turkey is an "unfortunate geography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He strongly advises learning English, calling it the "common language of the world for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>, even if traditional English-speaking empires decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. To be a strong intellectual, he concludes, one must learn English "flawlessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>, at a level enabling one to write literature or engage in major discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

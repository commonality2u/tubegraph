From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

[[alevi_as_a_rebellion_movement | Alevism]] is described as the name of a rebellion movement that emerged across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria at the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It constituted a tremendous uprising in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Demographics and Communities

The exact number of Alevis in Türkiye is not clearly known, with figures ranging from 8 to 10 million mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Approximately 4 to 4.5 million of them are defined as Anatolian Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Key communities associated with [[history_of_alevism | Alevism]] include:
*   **Anatolian Turks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Zazas**, for whom there is a slight indication of Turkish origins in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Hatay Arab Alevis (Nusayris)**, a significant community in the south, known for a more radical line of [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism beliefs]] compared to other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Albanian origin Alevis** in Thrace, possibly stemming from Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Tahtacılar** in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, whose origins are largely unknown despite speaking Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A French researcher proposed that the Tahtacılar are an element that remained before the arrival of Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Nature of the Movement

[[alevi_as_a_rebellion_movement | Alevism]] developed as a movement that could "shelter itself under the filth of Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It incorporated various elements that were in opposition at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Groups that joined this movement include:
*   **Old Turkmen elements**: These groups had been in constant rebellion since the 13th century, frequently rebelling when opportunities arose, refusing to pay taxes to the state, and not bowing to state-imposed religious practices like mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   A large portion of **Kurds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Armenians** and Armenian converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Various groups who were forcibly converted to Islam but found the new Alevi model more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Nusayris**: Though historically distinct from Islam, they declared themselves Alevis as this new model suited them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This group includes Christian converts and old Arab Christians from the coastal parts of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Formation Through Oppression

The formation of [[history_of_alevism | Alevism]] as a distinct identity was significantly influenced by state oppression. After the movement emerged, the state engaged in massacres, banning their names, and raiding their villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This oppression compelled people to integrate in a defensive position, fostering a sense of being "different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This led to the formation of secret codes, solidarity organizations, and a unique [[cultural_evolution_of_alevi_society | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Rejection of "Old Turkish Belief" Connection

The claim that [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] is an Islamic interpretation of old Turkish belief is explicitly rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is stated that [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] has nothing to do with old Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The attempt to connect [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] to old Turks is considered a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This connection is seen as a "metal pathology" formed within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It is suggested that due to not feeling part of the Muslim Ummah, fear of Sunnis, and hostile feelings towards them, Turkism, or the narrative of coming from Central Asia, is clung to as an alternative shelter, leading to this "ugly ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

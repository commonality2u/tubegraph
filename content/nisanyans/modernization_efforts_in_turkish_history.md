From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Modernization efforts in Turkish history span both the Ottoman and Republican periods, characterized by significant societal, political, and cultural transformations. These efforts often reflect a tension between traditional values and Western influences, and have profoundly shaped the nation's identity and trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

## Ottoman Modernization and Western Influence

During the [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization | Tanzimat Period]], educated Ottoman classes widely accepted the moral superiority of the West, particularly France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This acceptance was based on observations of Western societies regarding honesty, education, respect for women, cleanliness of cities, and advancements in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Key aspects of perceived Western morality included loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

> "Westerners don't take bribes as much as we do, lie about the subject... They are well-read, they educate their children, they respect their women, their cities are clean, they do not throw garbage in the ground, they spit on the streets, their educational institutions are magnificent, their parks and gardens are finger-warming, they are advanced in science, they are advanced in every subject." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>

### Women's Rights and Education

The issue of women's rights was a critical component of Ottoman modernization, with progressive intellectuals advocating for women's education from the 1840s and 1850s onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. The establishment of girls' schools and teacher training institutions was seen as crucial for societal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

*   **1880**: The first state girls' high school in France was established, and in the same year, the Darül muallimat (Girls' Teachers' School) opened in the Ottoman Empire, applying a Western-style curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.
*   **1900**: Istanbul University (Darülfünun) was established, followed shortly by a separate girls' Darülfünun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. Eventually, female students were accepted into all faculties after a boycott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.
*   **Pre-Republic (1920s)**: Women's magazines were widely published from the 1880s and 1890s, consistently emphasizing women's education as a path to a modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.

### Class Relations

Unlike the West, the concept of class was very weak in Ottoman culture until the 20th century, with progressive views on class basis becoming widespread in the West after the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. Discussions about the rights of the proletarian class, the poor, and peasants in Turkey only began to emerge after the Soviet Revolution in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Republican Era: Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Modernization

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as the founder of the Republic of Turkey, initiated far-reaching modernization and secularization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:77:41">[02:77:41]</a>. His actions are often defended as necessary to rebuild a collapsed state and protect its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:51">[03:08:51]</a>.

### Strategic Policy and Geopolitics

Atatürk's policies, from a historical perspective, were shaped by the urgent need to re-establish state power and secure its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

*   **State Rebuilding**: Faced with a ruined state, the priority was to rebuild it from scratch, similar to challenges faced by leaders like Stalin in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **National Excitement**: Efforts were made to create national excitement, even if "fake," in a country with a collapsed economy and a large immigrant population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.
*   **Westernism vs. Nationalism**: While Istanbul and Izmir elites embraced Westernism, ordinary citizens were motivated by stories of homeland, nation, and triumph against invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.
*   **Internal Control**: Deterrent measures, including executions, were taken to maintain discipline among comrades-in-arms from a "bloody tradition of intrigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **State Integrity**: Measures were taken against Kurds to prevent further state disintegration, following centuries of territorial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy**: Atatürk sought a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism, adapting policies based on international dynamics, such as seizing territory from Syria when France's influence waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Alleged British Influence

A debated aspect of [[turkish_historical_events | Atatürk's rise]] is his alleged close relationship with British services, particularly in the early stages of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. His modernization programs share striking similarities with those of Riza Shah Pahlavi in Iran, leading to speculation about a common guiding hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>.

*   **Parallel Programs**: Both leaders implemented Westernization programs, suppressed tribes, established Western educational institutions, and created state-led industrial enterprises like Sümerbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>.
*   **Staged Retreats**: It is suggested that the loss of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria in 1918 was a "staged fight" designed to facilitate a strategic withdrawal to Turkish-Kurdish inhabited borders, possibly the result of an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.
*   **Appointments and Discharges**: Atatürk's swift return to Istanbul after the Sultan's death in June 1918, his immediate acceptance by Sultan Vahdettin, and his appointment as Commander of the Palestine front are seen as suspicious. His first action in Palestine was to remove German Chiefs of Staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:53">[02:28:53]</a>.
*   **Intelligence Connections**: Atatürk maintained close, frequent meetings with the director of British intelligence in the Ottoman Empire in 1918-1919, only ceasing contact when he went to Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:42">[02:39:42]</a>.

The British policy aimed to eliminate Enver Pasha's influence, keep France and Russia out of Turkey, and establish a modern Turkish state with good relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### The "Kemalism Disease" and its Impact

The speaker argues that the fundamental problem in [[development_and_changes_in_modern_turkey | modern Turkey]] is not Atatürk himself, but the "Kemalism disease" embodied by his "disciples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This "disease" is characterized as:

*   **Contemporary Turkish Racism**: An "immoral racism" where Turks consider themselves virtuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **State and Flag Worship**: The Atatürk icon symbolizes a "moral blindness" that justifies all dishonesty in the name of the state, homeland, and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Elitist Hatred**: Semi-educated classes use this icon to project hatred outwards while losing emotional communication with their own common people internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Pathological Nationalism**: Unlike global nationalism which glorifies the people, Turkish nationalism is described as a "pathology specific to Türkiye," a semi-elite culture that despises its own society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Arrogance of the Nation**: The Kemalist sect, while rejecting Islam verbally, represents the deepest and most malignant dimension of historical Islam: the "arrogance of the nation," summarized as "We conquered, therefore we are right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This prevents understanding and emotional connection with neighboring peoples and former subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Blindness**: This mindset leads to ignorance on critical issues like the Kurdish question and an inability to grasp [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | Turkey's modern history]], which is viewed as a struggle between those rebelling against and those desperately maintaining this arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that unless Turkey overcomes the "Kemalism disease," it cannot achieve true civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This perspective has been consistently held by the speaker since his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Failures in Assimilation: The Kurdish Issue

Efforts to assimilate Kurds into Turkish society have largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>. The turning point is identified around 1980-1983, or even earlier in the 1960s, when Kurds began attending university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:57">[03:39:57]</a>. The belief that simply granting Turkish citizenship and conducting exams would assimilate them proved wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that "the Turks were defeated in this regard" and have not yet grasped this defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. The future is predicted to involve the Kurdish side integrating into and taking over the system from within, continuing a long-standing nationalism to reach a new balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Personal Scandals and Public Reaction

The public discourse surrounding Atatürk's personal life, particularly the gossip about his relationship with his adopted daughters and the case of his adopted son Abdurrahim, highlights the sensitivities and taboos in Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

*   **Atatürk's Daughters**: The rumor of a mistress relationship with his spiritual/adopted daughters was a widely known gossip throughout his life, documented in foreign memoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The core question posed is the moral and legal defensibility of an adult, single man adopting adolescent girls and keeping them in his private apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The very existence of such gossip is considered a disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Abdurrahim**: Atatürk adopted Abdurrahim, an orphaned child, in Van in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. Abdurrahim accompanied Atatürk through various fronts and lived with him in Istanbul and Çankaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:20">[02:23:20]</a>. However, just before Atatürk married Latife Hanım in late 1922, Abdurrahim was sent away to İzmir and later to Germany for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Abdurrahim's presence as an adopted son, theoretically an heir, was a major taboo until 10-15 years ago, only being brought up recently as a defense mechanism to counter criticisms regarding Atatürk's adopted daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Public Opinion**: A widespread discourse suggests that it is inappropriate to delve into Atatürk's private life given his role in founding the Republic and bringing modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The speaker, however, maintains that the adoption itself, regardless of any physical contact, was inherently problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Societal Responses to Controversy

The speaker recounts multiple instances of public "lynching campaigns" he has faced for his controversial statements, indicating the deep societal divisions and sensitivities in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

*   **Black Sea Guide Incident (2000)**: Comments in a travel guide about Bayburt resembling Afghanistan, a Topal Osman monument in Giresun (likened to Abdullah Çatlı), and the prevalence of "Natasha" sex workers in Trabzon and Rize sparked national outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. The speaker points out the irony that his statements were not negative but rather observations, often with a subtle mockery that incenses those who take these subjects very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech (2009, 2012)**: Campaigns erupted after he questioned the limits of freedom of speech regarding Allah and the Prophet, and later for statements on the Prophet Muhammad's historical personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He asserts he never insulted religious figures, but rather challenged the restriction of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Psychologist-Client Incident**: He was lynched for questioning the moral defensibility of public shaming campaigns against a psychologist involved in a sexual relationship with a client, viewing the popular reaction as a simplistic "Come on, shoot the [__]" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Elazığ Earthquake Incident**: He faced backlash for asking if those who hate the city's inhabitants should feel bad when it suffers a disaster, arguing for compassion towards innocent children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

The speaker sees these campaigns as transient and the perpetrators as "keyboard warriors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. He believes that directing public hatred towards individuals rather than the underlying causes or those in power is a "crime" and "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. These reactions reflect broader societal issues and challenges in [[political_changes_in_turkey | political changes in Turkey]].

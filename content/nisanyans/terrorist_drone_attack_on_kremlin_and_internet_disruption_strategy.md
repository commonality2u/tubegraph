Approximately 23 months prior to the recording, a terrorist drone attack occurred on the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To counteract and confuse incoming drones, a specific defense strategy was implemented: the internet is intermittently cut off for about a minute every 10 minutes within a 1-kilometer radius of the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This measure is intended to disorient the drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

During a visit, the speaker experienced the effects of these security measures, noting that while there isn't problem-free internet in the city generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, the disruption was particularly noticeable near the Kremlin. The speaker mentioned staying in a hotel across from the square that serves as the country's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, near where Putin's office is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Security Measures and Civilian Life
Despite these significant security measures around the Kremlin, daily life in the city appears largely unaffected. The speaker observed no signs of the country being at war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, with concerts, cinemas, and theaters full, and people engaged in their routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. There were no visible signs of fear or tension among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, and a notable absence of police or soldiers on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, beyond one or two officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Bypassing Restrictions
The speaker noted that while some security measures were in place around Putin's office, there were also "ways to bypass this" for those who knew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Locals reportedly described these bypasses as "simple, commonplace things that everyone uses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Using a VPN was suggested for better broadcasting, though interruptions were still expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Moving a couple of blocks away to a cafe would have resolved the internet issues, but the speaker needed to remain in the specific area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Additionally, going out onto a hotel balcony near Putin's office was prohibited due to concerns about potential "rifle attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

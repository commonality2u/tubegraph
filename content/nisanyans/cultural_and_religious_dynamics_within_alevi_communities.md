[[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] is sometimes presented as an [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | Islamic interpretation]] of old Turkish beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, this view is refuted by some analyses, which describe [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] as primarily the name of a widespread rebellion movement that emerged across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria towards the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## [[demographics_and_communities_of_alevis_in_trkiye | Demographics and Geographic Distribution]] in Türkiye

Precise figures on the number of Alevis in Türkiye are not clear, with estimates ranging from 8 million to 10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | Diverse Communities]]
Within Türkiye, Alevi communities exhibit significant [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | cultural and ethnic diversity]]:
*   **Anatolian Turks and Zazas** Approximately 4 to 4.5 million Alevis are defined as Turks in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The Zazas are also noted, though there is only a "slightest indication that they were Turks in the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Hatay Arab Alevis (Nusayris)** A large community, particularly in the south of Hatay, are Arab Alevis, also known as Nusayris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Their beliefs are considered "much more radical" compared to other Alevi groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Thracian Alevis** In Thrace, there are Alevis of Albanian origin, potentially stemming from Southern Albania and connected to Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Tahtacilar** Found in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, the Tahtacilar's origins are "completely unknown" despite speaking Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A French researcher concluded they are an element remaining from pre-Turkic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[historical_development_of_alevism | Historical Formation and Nature of Alevism]]

### [[rebellions_and_social_integration_of_alevism | Alevism as a Rebellion Movement]]
[[historical_context_and_origins_of_alevism_in_anatolia_and_surrounding_regions | Alevism]] emerged as a tremendous uprising in the late 15th century, described as a movement that could "end against Islam" or "shelter itself under the filth of Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This movement became a refuge for various groups opposed to the dominant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Groups Joining the Uprising
The movement attracted diverse populations:
*   **Old Turkmen Elements** These groups had been in constant rebellion since the 13th century, frequently rebelling, refusing to pay state taxes, and rejecting state teachers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Kurds** A significant portion of Kurds joined the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Armenians and Converts** Armenians, including converts to Islam, participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Nusayris and Arab Christians** The Nusayris, who are described as having "nothing to do with Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, and former Christian converts in Syria's coastal regions, along with old Arab Christians, found this new model suitable and declared themselves Alevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The "Old Turkish Belief" Claim and Identity

### Rejection of the Claim
The idea that [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] has "nothing to do with the old Turks" is strongly asserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Claims that Alevis are descendants of ancient Turks or are continuing an isolated ancient religion are labeled as "shameful" and "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Alevism as a Response to Oppression
Alevism's formation is linked to historical oppression: "oppression brings people together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It led to the integration of various groups in a defensive position, fostering the formation of secret codes, solidarity organizations, and a distinct culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Search for Identity
The attempt to connect [[introduction_to_alevism | Alevism]] to old Turkish roots is described as a "metal pathology" formed when individuals do not feel part of the Muslim Ummah, fear Sunnis, and harbor hostile feelings towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In this context, Turkism, particularly the idea of coming from Central Asia, is seen as an alternative and a "shelter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This process contributes to the formation of a "ugly ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

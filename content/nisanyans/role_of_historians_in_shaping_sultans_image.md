When assessing the image of rulers like Fatih Sultan Mehmet, it is crucial to understand the historical context and the motivations of those who recorded their deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historians play a significant role in shaping public perception, often influenced by political agendas rather than purely objective accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## General [[historical_portrayal_of_rulers | Historical Portrayal of Rulers]]

Across various historical periods and cultures—including the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, China, India, and the Abbasid Caliphate—historical texts often feature stereotyped sentences and eulogies about rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This practice was also prevalent in medieval Turkish states, where a sultan was either presented as an exemplary figure or demonized if disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For instance, a disliked sultan might be depicted as dishonest, immoral, cruel, or irreligious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

> [!info] The Historian's Approach
> A good historian's reaction to claims about rulers is not to question if the statement is true, but *why* it was said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This applies whether the statement is in favor or against the ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Portrayal of Fatih Sultan Mehmet

Information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet from Turkish Ottoman sources is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Early histories, such as Aşıkpaşazade's, were written shortly after his death, and later "House Histories" emerged around the 1860s and 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. These are largely official histories of the Ottoman dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Ottoman Sources

Despite being official histories, the attitude of Turkish historians towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet is often described as "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Particularly towards the end of his rule, Fatih was not a beloved sultan and was associated with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He ruthlessly suppressed the Turkish-Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property and executing many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. His 30-year reign was characterized by constant warfare, with new campaigns declared annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Byzantine Sources and Political Agendas

More detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet comes from Byzantine historians like Halkondylis and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They lived during his time, met him personally, and were aware of the situation in his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, their accounts were not impartial; both historians had political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Their writings often aimed to serve specific interests in Italy, particularly concerning relations between Italian states like Genoa and Venice and the Ottoman court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. They sought to establish alliances or rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy within the framework of evolving global power balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This reflects the complex diplomatic realities of the era, where the Ottoman Empire was engaged in extensive interactions and conflicts with various states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

These accounts presented Fatih Sultan Mehmet in a light similar to the rulers of the [[comparisons_between_fatih_sultan_mehmet_and_renaissance_rulers | Renaissance Italian city states]] of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. They even claimed he knew Latin and Italian and was aware of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Challenges in Historical Accuracy

It is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of statements made about sultans and state administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Historical accounts, whether praising or condemning, often rely on cliché, ready-made expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Examples include claims such as a ruler being "very religious" or, conversely, "not religious but secretly prays," being a "poet," or even personally making architectural drawings for major projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

> [!warning] Verification Issues
> These are often "sentences in quotes," and their veracity cannot be confirmed unless one could speak directly with the historical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

After centuries, the information and vocabulary circulated about state rulers become very difficult to verify, as they are "released to the market through buffets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This challenge is comparable to attempting to gain a realistic and objective picture of contemporary heads of state from current literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The potential of large datasets for [[social_sciences | social science]] research in Türkiye is immense, though the current academic climate often overlooks these valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Public Data Breach and Research Potential

An incident involving the theft of e-government data belonging to 85 million people was reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This data, which includes goods and property, was published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The speaker questions why such information, collected by the state, would be considered state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It was revealed that the database in question had been available on the market since February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The speaker is actively involved in reorganizing the "Turkish Dictionary of Names," which he describes as an "amazing" and "very large database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This database contains records of 100 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Approximately 97 million of these are citizens of the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Around 3 million are foreigners residing in Türkiye who do not have a Turkish ID number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Birth dates in the database go back to the 1780s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   More than 3 million names in total, with probably around 5 million names belonging to deceased individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the potential of this "magnificent source of information" for expanding understanding and better comprehending the "first face of Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He asserts that all individuals engaged in [[social_sciences | social sciences]] should utilize such a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Challenges in Academic Approach to Information

A critique is leveled against the academic world, suggesting that subjects related to information or truth are no longer prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Information is described as "not something that is sought after and is popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Instead, bureaucratic wars constitute the primary area of interest for academics, rendering material not useful in these small conflicts as valueless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This situation is deemed "pathetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

A historical parallel is drawn to discussions in the *Taraf Newspaper* years ago, concerning why those in authority, particularly in [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkey]], insist on defending "clearly lies on absurd issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Examples given include claims such as "Hittites are Turks" or "Armenian Genocide did not happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This insistence on "stupid and empirically easy to falsify lies" serves as a "loyalty test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The reasoning is that someone who obeys a known lie demonstrates unquestioning loyalty to authority, as opposed to loyalty to truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This dynamic is applied to the meaning of displaying the LGBT flag at embassies, viewing it as a loyalty test for adherence to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. This system aims to enforce submission and obedience, even through indefensible impositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.

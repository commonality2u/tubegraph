The success and proliferation of religions throughout history have often been intrinsically linked to their relationship with state power and governmental structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. This dynamic highlights the significant influence states can have on the [[development_and_influence_of_religious_institutions | development and influence of religious institutions]] and their longevity.

## Manichaeism: A Religion Without a State
Manichaeism, founded by the prophet Mani in the 3rd century CE in Babylon (part of the Iranian country at the time), saw a tremendous spread, particularly in the Eastern Front of Iran, extending into Central Asia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. During the 1780s and 1790s, the Uyghur Khans and Turks collectively embraced Manichaeism as their religion, translating many of its religious texts, prayers, and educational books into Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

Despite its initial spread, Manichaeism was ultimately "crushed" and largely disappeared after the 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. The primary reason cited for its defeat was the absence of a supporting state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. Unlike major religions that gained vast empires, Manichaeism lacked this crucial foundation, making it vulnerable and ultimately leading to its erasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

## Christianity: State-Backed Expansion
In contrast to Manichaeism, Christianity flourished due to the backing of powerful empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>. The immense Roman and Byzantine Empires, which controlled the entire Mediterranean Basin from the Atlantic to the Euphrates/Tigris rivers, adopted Christianity as their state religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. This state support, coupled with influential patriarchates acting as institutions under state protection, allowed Christianity to spread rapidly and sustain its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

Even in the Iranian state where Christianity also gained ground, it was an "outside the state" phenomenon, and its different sects, like the Nestorians, who lacked state backing, were easily "eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.

## Islam: Born as a State
Islam, from its very inception, emerged as a state and quickly transformed into a "giant empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>. This immediate intertwining of religious doctrine with political and military power allowed Islam to expand rapidly, conquering significant parts of the old Christian world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. This foundational state characteristic has been a key factor in its enduring [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | role and perception of religion in society]].

## [[zoroastrianism_and_its_influence_on_other_religions | Zoroastrianism]]: A Bureaucratic State Religion
[[zoroastrianism_and_its_influence_on_other_religions | Zoroastrianism]], the state religion of the Iranian Empire before Islam, held distinct characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>. It was never a "popular religion" in the sense of widespread spiritual adoption by the masses, but rather a "bureaucratic religion," largely governed by state civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.

A significant spiritual void existed among the populace between the 3rd and 7th centuries, with many Iranians adopting other faiths like Christianity or Manichaeism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. When the Sassanid state fell, [[zoroastrianism_and_its_influence_on_other_religions | Zoroastrianism]] swiftly declined as it lost its primary source of security and power, demonstrating its dependence on state backing for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
The historical examples of Manichaeism, Christianity, Islam, and [[zoroastrianism_and_its_influence_on_other_religions | Zoroastrianism]] underscore a recurring pattern: the long-term success and influence of a religion are often contingent upon the presence and support of a strong state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>. Religions that integrate with state power tend to solidify their position, while those without such backing face significant challenges to their survival and proliferation.

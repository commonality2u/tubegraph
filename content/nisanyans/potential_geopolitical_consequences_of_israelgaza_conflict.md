## Current Situation and Context
The speaker notes that the [[palestine_and_israel_conflict | Israel-Palestine conflict]] has a long history, with both sides claiming rights to the land, though the Palestinian claim may be slightly stronger objectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Historically, the speaker admired Israel for its idealism and effort in its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, the first gas bombardment of Gaza fundamentally shifted the speaker's perspective, viewing Israel's continued "Apartheid regime" as indefensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Gaza is described as an "open air concentration camp" where people have been imprisoned for 17 years, subjected to starvation, bombing, and humiliating treatment when attempting to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The idea of holding a rock festival for peace outside the wires of such a place is deemed "shamelessness, cowardice and dishonesty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The speaker critiques the Western press and Turkish educated classes for their "disgusting" immediate siding with Israel following recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. There is a perceived "rabid hostility towards Arabs" in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The argument that Israel's actions are legitimate because Hamas slaughtered people is dismissed as "despicable" and "dishonorable," given Israel's repeated bombardments of civilians in Gaza for 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Comparisons are drawn to the German occupation force's actions in ghettos during World War II, where people were imprisoned, starved, and hunted, based on the dehumanizing belief that they were "not human, they are animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The speaker finds it deplorable that a nation founded on revenge for such oppression now justifies similar oppression with the same discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Potential Escalation Scenarios
There are two main possibilities regarding the recent Hamas attack on Israel:
*   **Israel's Unawareness/Blind Eye** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>: This theory suggests that Israel was either completely unaware of the highly risky operation, or it turned a blind eye to it and did not react immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This is considered suspicious by a majority of commentators, who believe it was designed by Israel for a certain purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The purpose would be to "solve the Palestinian problem fundamentally," potentially aiming for a "final solution" by cutting off gas, electricity, water, and food to Gaza, which could lead to widespread death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Unforeseen Risk for Israel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>: This counter-argument posits that such an attack, resulting in hundreds of Israeli casualties and soldiers captured, is too risky and damaging to Israel's image to have been intentionally allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

If the conflict escalates into a "chain attack" involving Hamas, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Syria opening a Northern front, it could reach "very serious dimensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This could lead to ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza, and potentially other forms of ethnic cleansing elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Precedent of Ethnic Cleansing
The speaker highlights the recent ethnic cleansing operation in Nagorno-Karabakh a month prior, where 100,000 people were exiled from their homeland with no international intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This is seen as a striking development, creating a precedent that a country can invade another, and its people can be "kidnapped through terrorism" in 2023 without global repercussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. The speaker warns that if the people of Palestine/Gaza are ethnically cleansed, the people of Israel might face a similar fate later, triggering their long-standing "nightmare and fear" since 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Israel's Sustainability Challenges
Israel's basic domestic and foreign policy logic stems from being a "small country surrounded by enemies" who historically aimed to "throw the Israeli people into the sea and destroy them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Israel's stance is that it has been fighting a "War of Existence and Absence" for 70-80 years, where "everything is permissible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

However, the speaker argues that Israel faces several fundamental contradictions:
*   **Economic Sustainability**: Israel is not an economically sustainable country and has relied on over a trillion dollars in aid from America since its establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. It has not managed to stand on its own feet economically for 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic/Strategic Sustainability**: Due to religious fanaticism and its own "mindless defiant policies," Israel has alienated the Islamic world, which numbers over 1.5 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. While Israel has technological superiority and won past wars against larger Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, the Arab world is advancing, making future conflicts uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Reliance on America**: The extent to which America can continue its seemingly unconditional support for Israel is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. A change in U.S. domestic policy could leave Israel to face the entire Islamic world alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Social Structure**: Israel's population is largely middle-class or above, lacking a working or peasant class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This forces it to use Palestinians for labor, creating a "slave labor" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. This structure, similar to Gulf emirates where local citizens rule over foreign laborers without citizenship rights, is deemed unsustainable in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

The "two-state solution," advocated by China, Russia, and Turkey, is seen as legally valid but not practically workable, as Israel needs Palestinian labor and Palestinians need Israeli employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. The speaker suggests a single state where all, including Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews, have equal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. However, Israel's unique foundation conditions prevent it from achieving this modern state order, maintaining a system where a ruling class differs in religion and affiliation from a lower class treated as "second-class citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This unsustainable order could lead to Israel disappearing, akin to the Crusader Kingdom of Israel in the same geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

## Role of Major Powers
A potential war involving Iran and Saudi Arabia together, with Syria and Iraq, could challenge Israel's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. The speaker argues that the outcome of such a conflict is "not at all certain," giving Iran a significant advantage against America if nuclear weapons are not used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.America's defeat in Afghanistan, despite fighting for 20 years, is cited as an example of its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Iran's resilience, especially with potential support from Saudi Arabia (financial) and Russia (technological/industrial), makes its defeat uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

## Global Conflict Implications
There is a 51% chance that a very serious war will break out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. The speaker suggests that the nature of such a conflict, particularly its escalation to a nuclear level, is unknown due to advancements in nuclear technology since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Putin's recently announced new nuclear missile system, if true and functional, could entirely overturn the logic of nuclear strategy, potentially allowing for strikes without immediate detection or clear target identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. This could create a "disaster scenario" where a "balance of terror" based on known missile locations and first-strike capabilities is destabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.

The speaker believes that the American leadership is "psychopaths" and "perverts" who might initiate such a war if facing a "complete economic impasse" or on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. A "cornered cat scratches very badly," and NATO, the United States, and the European Union are currently cornered and facing destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

### Turkey's Position
Türkiye's foreign policy since around 2014 has focused on desperately trying to stay out of a possible major conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. As a NATO member, Turkey will face heavy pressure to intervene on the NATO front in a war between Russia and the West, or between Iran and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. The speaker supports Turkey's efforts to remain neutral, considering it the "only reasonable policy" and a wise effort that should be supported to prevent Turkish citizens from dying in such a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

Regarding Azerbaijan-Israel relations, the speaker notes a simple relationship based on Azerbaijan's oil and Israel's need for allies against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Israel's "deep mental eclipse" leads it to pursue irrational hostility towards Iran, hence its friendliness with Azerbaijan based on the principle "Iran's enemy is my friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Furthermore, special interests and bribery play a significant role in foreign relations, especially in countries like Azerbaijan or under leaders like Netanyahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Turkey maintains an "extremely cautious policy regarding Israel" and will not participate in the Arab conflict, aiming to stay away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. Therefore, there is no immediate possibility of deterioration in relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the [[geopolitical_dynamics_in_the_middle_east | Israel-Gaza conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. The speaker anticipates a rapid softening of Turkey-Armenia and Azerbaijan-Armenia relations after the resolution of the Karabakh issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

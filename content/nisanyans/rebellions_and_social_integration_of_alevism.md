[[historical_context_and_origins_of_alevism_in_anatolia_and_surrounding_regions | Alevism]] emerged as a significant rebellion movement across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria towards the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This powerful uprising, described as a "tremendous uprising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, had a strong anti-establishment and anti-Islamic stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, though it sometimes found shelter under the guise of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Diverse Communities and Early Rebellions

The movement attracted a wide array of groups who had been in constant opposition to state authority:
*   **Old Turkmen Elements** These groups had been in continuous rebellion since the 13th century, frequently refusing to pay taxes or submit to the state's teachers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Kurds** A significant portion of Kurds joined this uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Armenians** This included both Armenians and Armenian converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Arab Christians and Nusayris** In the coastal regions of Syria, groups like the Nusayris, who are described as having "nothing to do with Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, and various Christian converts, also adopted this new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### Demographic Scope in Türkiye

While exact figures are unclear, estimates suggest there are between 8 to 10 million Alevis in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Approximately 4 to 4.5 million individuals defined as Anatolian Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Zazas, with some historical indications of Turkish origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   A significant community of Arab Alevis, also known as Nusayris, primarily in Hatay in the south, who hold a more radical line of belief compared to other Alevi groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   Alevis of Albanian origin in Thrace, possibly stemming from Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   The Tahtacılar in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, whose origins are largely unknown but who speak Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Some research suggests they are an element that existed before the arrival of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Social Integration through Oppression

The Alevi movement solidified through shared experiences of oppression. As authorities "massacred, crushed, banned" their names, and raided their villages, persecution became a unifying force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This oppression fostered integration and a defensive stance, leading to the formation of:
*   Secret codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>
*   Solidarity organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>
*   A distinct [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>

## Rejection of "Old Turkish Belief" Theory

The notion that [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | Alevism]] is an [[alevism_as_an_islamic_interpretation_of_turkish_beliefs | Islamic interpretation of old Turkish beliefs]] is strongly refuted within the discourse. Alevism is asserted to have "nothing to do with the old Turks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, calling such claims a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This connection is characterized as a "metal pathology" formed by individuals who do not feel they belong to the Muslim ummah and harbor hostile feelings towards Sunnis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Instead, the embrace of Turkism as an alternative or shelter is seen as clinging to a "fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

Alevism, therefore, is portrayed as a distinct cultural and social phenomenon forged through rebellion and shared hardship rather than a direct continuation of ancient Turkish religious practices.

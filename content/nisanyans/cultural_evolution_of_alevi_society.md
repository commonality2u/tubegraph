From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Alevi society is a sensitive and often closed community, making it challenging for outsiders to fully comprehend its intricacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01"></a>. Many, even within Turkey, remained largely unaware of Alevi existence until relatively recently, with personal discovery often occurring during university years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59"></a>. Significant exposure often comes from participation in Alevi festivals, such as the Hacıbektaş festival in 1978, or extensive travel to Alevi-dense regions like Tunceli during the late 1970s and early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46"></a>. A deeper understanding typically involves reading extensive literature on the [[history_of_alevism | history of Alevism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30"></a>.

## Historical Genesis and Development

The form of [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] known today largely crystallized between the 1400s and 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45"></a>. It originated as a significant revolutionary and protest movement against classical (Sunni) Islam, initiated by the Safavid dynasty (Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, Shah Ismail) in Ardabil, Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30"></a>. This religious reform movement interestingly coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36"></a>.

The movement grew to a point that threatened the Ottoman Empire, starting in the later years of Fatih Sultan Mehmet and continuing through Beyazıt II's reign, eventually suppressed by Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06"></a>. While the Shah Ismail movement sparked a new political constellation, it built upon earlier roots, including 13th-century rebellions in Anatolia (like those of Baba Ishak and Baba Ilyas) and remnants of traditions such as Hurufism and Batinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39"></a>.

The rise of [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] also involved large groups in Anatolia who had converted to Islam under duress and harbored unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58"></a>. The movement effectively brought together various centers of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02"></a>.

The Ottoman state considered [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] an ideological, existential threat, ruthlessly suppressing it for centuries through massacres, exiles to mountains, and declaring its followers illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27"></a>. This severe oppression continued, even escalating in the 19th century during the suppression of the Janissary Corps, leading to violent persecution of Alevis and Bektashis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59"></a>. Consequently, Alevis maintained a contentious [[relationship_between_alevism_and_turkish_identity | relationship with the state]], living often illegally, hiding their identity, and worshiping secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19"></a>.

## Core Beliefs and Practices

The fundamental characteristic of [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] is a resistance to Islamic bigotry, Islamic law, and the Sunni Islam model enforced by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50"></a>. Alevism constitutes a movement that rejects core tenets of mainstream Islam as defined by the state:
*   No traditional fasting or a different form of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10"></a>.
*   Rejection of Sharia law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14"></a>.
*   No pilgrimage or zakat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17"></a>.

Despite these rejections, Alevis define themselves as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28"></a>. Their self-definition and form are rooted in supporting Ahl al-Bayt (the family of Muhammad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50"></a>. They do not recognize the first four caliphs, except Ali, believing Ali to be the true successor of Muhammad, followed by the Twelve Imams from his lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37"></a>.

While some themes originated from classical Shia Islam, the Shah Ismail movement ultimately forged a new incident and political constellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19"></a>. Unlike Iranian Shiism, which has a strong madrasah tradition and a mullah hierarchy, [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] in Turkey lacks a central organization due to historical oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20"></a>. Instead, it relies on local dedes who continue a shamanic and traditional rahite tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40"></a>.

## Diverse Influences and Communities

[[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] is an eclectic movement, drawing various elements into a common anti-state and anti-Sunni political and religious movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55"></a>.

*   **Turkmen and Turkish Tribes:** While some believe it resisted Islam due to Shamanist Turkic influences, this is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13"></a>. Many Turkish and Turkmen tribes who were "half-Muslims" on the fringes of Islam joined the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28"></a>. Approximately half of the Alevis in Turkey today identify as Turkish and are attached to Turkmen and Central Asian heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13"></a>.
*   **Kurdish Influence:** A significant portion of Alevis are of Kurdish origin, especially in the areas west of the Euphrates, such as Malatya, Sivas, Tunceli, and Erzincan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47"></a>. Historically, Kurds carried diverse local traditions and heterodox beliefs, many supporting anti-Islamic movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30"></a>.
*   **Arab Alevis (Nusayris):** In Antakya and Hatay, there is an Arab Alevi population, often referred to as Nusayri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04"></a>. Their traditions, worship, and beliefs are distinctly different and closer to pre-Islamic Middle Eastern traditions and Arab Christians in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11"></a>.
*   **Christian Influences:** There are notable influences of Christianity in Alevi belief, particularly in the figure of Ali, who is akin to Jesus, and the existence of 12 followers resembling the 12 apostles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15"></a>. Some ceremonies strongly resemble Christian symbols like Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19"></a>.
*   **Balkan Alevis:** Alevis are also found in Albania and Bulgaria. In southern Albania, a significant portion of the Muslim population is affiliated with Bektashism, representing a "not fully Muslim" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13"></a>. In the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria, Alevis are noted for their strong anti-state tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33"></a>.
*   **Tahtacıs and Abdals:**
    *   **Tahtacıs:** Found in the Aegean and Mediterranean coastal mountains (Antalya to Çanakkale), these are forest villagers known for tree cutting and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23"></a>. They have a distinct, primitive culture and historically lived nomadically, showing little harmony with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47"></a>. They are often not associated with leftism and some even vote for the MHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57"></a>.
    *   **Abdals:** Concentrated in regions like Gaziantep, Abdals are also considered Alevis but possess a separate culture and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17"></a>. They are often involved in music and entertainment and are sometimes mistakenly grouped with Romani people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33"></a>. They maintain a healthy skepticism towards state authority and do not take Muslims seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07"></a>.

## Geographic Distribution

The Alevi population is dense in a triangular region encompassing Sivas (especially Divriği, Kangal districts), Tunceli-Erzincan, parts of Tokat and Amasya, and extending south to Maraş and Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51"></a>. This region largely overlaps with the historical spread of the Paulician rebellion against the Byzantine Orthodox Church in the 8th and 9th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19"></a>. Divriği, an important center for Paulicians, remains a core of Alevi culture today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45"></a>.

The Alevi geography is often described as a buffer zone between historical powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54"></a>. It is concentrated west of Eastern Anatolia, on the west bank of the Euphrates, distinct from regions like Van, Hakkari, Siirt, and Mardin, where Alevis are virtually absent due to systematic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23"></a>.

## [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevi Identity and Political Landscape]]

Alevis, having faced centuries of state hostility due to their anti-Sunni Islamic stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35"></a>, find a unique political alignment in modern Turkey. The dominant Sunni Islam ideology in the state defines Alevis as outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07"></a>.

### Association with Kemalism

The [[alevi_community_and_their_association_with_kemalism | Alevi community's association with Kemalism]] stems from its promise of secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48"></a>. For Alevis, Ataturk and secularism symbolized the first time the state offered them a place, allowing them to participate in government, police, and military roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03"></a>. This alignment reflects their desire for a share in the state's resources and recognition, challenging the dominant Sunni narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47"></a>.

However, Kemalism is seen as a dead end for Alevi political aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38"></a>. It is viewed as a "bitter" political approach, doomed to remain a minority policy in Turkey, unable to win broad democratic support against the prevailing Islamic ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00"></a>.

### Shift to Leftist Movements

In the 1960s, Alevis initially attempted to engage in moderate right-wing politics, seeking common ground with Muslims within parties like the Justice Party, hoping for political rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30"></a>. After being disillusioned, they founded their own party, the Turkish Unity Party, which quickly shifted from right to left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01"></a>.

By the 1970s, Alevis largely moved towards the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11"></a>. The revolutionary youth movement of the 1970s in Turkey was overwhelmingly (around 90%) composed of Alevi youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56"></a>. This significantly impacted the [[influence_of_alevism_on_turkish_leftist_movements | leftist culture in Turkey]], shaping its aesthetics (e.g., baglama, folk songs, specific fashion, male-female relations), and its primary anti-Muslim stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35"></a>.

## Contemporary Identity and Challenges

Modern [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevi identity]] is complex, often serving as an "ethnic definition element" regardless of actual Turkic or Kurdish origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54"></a>. Many Alevis, even those who have adapted to modern life and may not actively practice Alevism, carry a foundation of skepticism towards official state narratives and authority due to their familial upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55"></a>.

Despite this resilience, Turkish society and the state are "quite successful in assimilating people," often melting identities away within two or three generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17"></a>. This ongoing challenge highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of Alevi cultural identity within modern Turkey.

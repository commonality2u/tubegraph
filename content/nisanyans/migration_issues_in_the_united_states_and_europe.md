## United States Border Situation

The United States is currently experiencing what some describe as an "invasion" due to high levels of [[Immigration trends and political impact in the US and Europe | irregular immigration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Approximately 250,000 to 300,000 people are reportedly entering the United States each month through its open borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This situation has led to significant political tension, particularly in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

The federal government, under the Biden administration, is perceived by some as having "completely let it go" regarding border control, having abandoned previous efforts to build a wall or tighten controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This perceived inaction led the Governor of Texas to declare that he would protect the border himself, prompting the central government to consider deploying army troops against Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Such actions are seen by some as a defense of an open border policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

It is suggested that half of the US states are "in rebellion" and are preparing for a serious armed conflict against the federal government over border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>. For example, Texas announced it would establish a second border within its territory and mobilize its state militia, inviting other states to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>. Reports suggest that a million people moved to Texas with their guns in response to this call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>. These events are described as "fantastic" and unprecedented in the last 80-90 years, reminiscent of the 1920s and 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.

## Global and European Immigration Trends

The situation in the United States regarding [[Global immigration trends and their impact | immigration]] is not unique, with similar patterns observed in other countries like England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Some countries are experiencing an influx of irregular immigrants that far exceeds their annual birth rates, leading to what is termed "population replacement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

One economic reason suggested for this phenomenon is the need for cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Western countries, including America and England, had previously exported their industries to regions like China, the Far East, and Mexico in search of cheaper labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. This outsourcing led to the disappearance of domestic industries and employment opportunities, leaving younger generations with limited job prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. While there are discussions about bringing industry back, the local population in Western countries is often unwilling to work for cheap wages due to existing rights and the high cost of employing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Consequently, importing cheap labor becomes a perceived solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### Historical Parallels of Mass Migration

The speaker raises concerns about the social impact of large-scale migration, noting that historical empires, such as the Roman Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate, experienced significant changes due to [[mass_migration_and_its_societal_impact | migrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

*   **Roman Empire:** The Roman Empire reportedly collapsed due to migrations of much lower numbers than seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Germanic peoples, initially invited for work, eventually challenged and overthrew the empire after a generation or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Abbasid State:** Similarly, the Arab empire imported Turkish soldiers, who, after a couple of generations, took over governance in regions like Egypt and Aleppo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

### Political Discourse and Challenges in Europe

Political discourse in [[Migration Issues in Europe | Europe]] and the United States is increasingly centered on the [[Immigration trends and political impact in the US and Europe | immigration issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. There is a clear political dividing line between those who view immigration as an "irresistible wave" or natural disaster and those who advocate for welcoming immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

It is observed that anti-immigration parties are gaining significant traction in European countries and are likely to win elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Examples include the rise of Erik Zemur in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a> and Donald Trump's perceived strong position in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. Despite the rising rhetoric against immigration, the speaker believes that countries will not be able to stop it due to economic necessity, as their economies rely on immigrant labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

## Europe's Loss of Assimilation Capacity

Europe has lost its historical capacity for assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. Historically, societies receiving migrants would educate and integrate them, especially their children, into the dominant culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. However, modern Europe lacks this ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

*   Only immigrants with a certain level of education can be assimilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.
*   Others cannot be assimilated due to their large numbers, the structure of European societies, or their desire to protect their own cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   Immigrants often build their own communities within existing societies, as European societies offer little beyond financial aid to encourage cultural integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:01]</a>.
*   For those living in poverty and working long hours, there is little opportunity or incentive to engage with European cultural offerings, leading them to shelter in their own cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.

This situation has reached a crisis point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. One possibility is a complete halt to [[immigration_trends_and_political_impact_in_the_us_and_europe | immigration]], but this is deemed economically impossible due to the lack of a European class willing to perform the jobs immigrants do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. The other possibility is the gradual handing over of streets and cities to immigrants, a process already largely underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. Major European cities like Paris, London, Rome, and Milan are seen as "invaded" by immigrants, with white populations retreating to "inner castles" or rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>. The concern is that this trend will extend to schools, universities, and eventually political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

The long-term outcome of this struggle is predicted to be a victory for "the barbarians," meaning those with "nothing to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

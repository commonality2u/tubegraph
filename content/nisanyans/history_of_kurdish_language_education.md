The emergence of the Kurmanji language as a written and cultural language is contingent on several fundamental conditions. The primary requirement is the provision of education in Kurmanji, spanning primary, secondary, high school, and university levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This also necessitates the development of a teaching staff capable of instructing in the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>, the standardization of its spelling, and the establishment of teaching and educational standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. Furthermore, a corpus of literature that every young person should read must emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

Public administration cannot be effectively conducted independently of Kurdish being adopted as an official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Young people educated in Kurdish, who acquire skills in Kurdish spelling, composition, and petition writing, will naturally seek to apply these skills in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Denying this opportunity would lead to rebellion and create a situation of "first-class second-class citizenship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Conversely, if Kurdish is accepted as an official possibility in public affairs, then educational provisions in Kurdish are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. Education in Kurdish and its adoption as an official or regional language are interconnected and cannot be considered separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, European and Western countries have actively competed in granting language rights to minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This trend began with the official recognition of Catalan and Basque as official languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. In Spain, this led to demands for official status for Galician, and then for Asturian and Andalusian dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. In Switzerland, the Romansh language, despite being the smallest of its four official languages, saw efforts to make official correspondence quadrilingual and introduce Romansh education in high schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. However, it was discovered that Romansh had five distinct dialects, leading to the creation of a blended curriculum language that was rejected by Romansh speakers who insisted on their own dialects being recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. Similar developments occurred in Italy with languages like Bergamasco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>, and in Germany with the Slavic Sorbian language, where traffic signs became bilingual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

This trend of language recognition reached a point where the Occitan language in southern France, previously almost dead, was revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. However, it was then realized that Occitan itself was not a single language but a spectrum of 20 different languages and dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. In the Breton region of France, centuries of suppression of Breton names and language were reversed by the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

This era of promoting minority language rights is now seen as coming to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>. The difficulty of cleanly categorizing and separating languages, and the endless demand for every local language or dialect to be included in educational curricula and official documents, leads to an "bottomless pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

In [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_of_turkish_language | Türkiye]], while Turkish and Kurdish were initially recognized, it was later realized that Kurdish included different languages like Kurmanji and Zazaki, which are mutually unintelligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. The question then arose as to which one should be the language of education or official documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>. Further complications arose when it was recognized that Zazaki itself comprises at least two distinct languages, such as those spoken in Bingöl and Dersim, which are quite separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

The project and dream of linguistic specialization are considered much weaker in 2025 than they were in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

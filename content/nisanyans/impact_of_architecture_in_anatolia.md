Anatolia's rich history is deeply reflected in its diverse architectural landscape, which showcases a blend of influences from various civilizations that have inhabited the region. The urban and architectural fabric of Anatolia primarily reflects the legacies of the Seljuk, Beylik (principality), and Ottoman periods, alongside earlier Armenian and Byzantine contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

## Seljuk and Beylik Period Architecture

Many of the cities that serve as provincial and district centers in modern Türkiye were founded or significantly developed during the Seljuk and Beylik (principality) periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>. The current urban texture of these city centers is largely a product of this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>. The truly impressive architectural works that remain standing today, such as mosques, madrasahs, bridges, caravanserais, baths, and hospitals, predominantly date from the Seljuk and Beylik periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.

This era, specifically from the 1190s to the mid-15th century, was a time of significant [[Urbanization and cultural adaptation in Turkey|urbanization]] across Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. Cities and towns were strategically established at key points and road intersections, serving as vital trade and cultural centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. A notable characteristic of Seljuk and Beylik architecture is its originality; none of the great mosques from this period are alike, each demonstrating a unique and creative design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

## Ottoman Architecture

In contrast to the Seljuk and Beylik periods, the architectural heritage from the Ottoman era in the Anatolian countryside is relatively limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. Following the Ottoman conquest, mosques were built in every town and city, but these often adhered to a standard, templated architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>. Significant Ottoman architectural achievements are primarily found in the three imperial capitals: Edirne, Bursa, and Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>. Beyond these, few substantial Ottoman structures remain in Anatolia, apart from some mosques built by local feudal lords in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Influences and Continuities

The architectural styles in Anatolia demonstrate clear continuities with preceding civilizations. The Turkish and Islamic architecture east of the Euphrates River, exemplified by structures in places like Erzurum, Kars, Ahlat, and Silvan, is a continuation of Armenian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>. This influence is evident in the materials, aesthetics, and concepts of integrity used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. Similarly, west of the Euphrates, Turkish and Islamic architecture continues the traditions of Byzantine architecture, with Hagia Sophia serving as a clear example of continuity into Ottoman mosque design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

The Sivas Divriği Mosque, a masterpiece of Seljuk architecture, raises questions about its designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:26">[01:33:26]</a>. While some suggest Armenian architects and workers due to their distinctive stone-shaping skills, the underlying influences are more complex than simple ethnic attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>.

Beginning in Ahlat, a pivotal location in Eastern Anatolia, a new Islamic architectural synthesis emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. This synthesis incorporated the traditions, technical mastery, and forms of older Armenian architecture, reinterpreting them with a new spirit and ideological meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. Examples include the Ahlat tombs, Tercan Mamahatun tombs, and structures in Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>. This represents a [[cultural evolution in Anatolia|new vision of civilization]] that emerged from the existing cultural landscape after the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, rather than a complete replacement of previous cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>. It signifies a period where an existing ideological structure and customs transformed, leading to a new state, architecture, symbolism, and ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. This transformation provides a new perspective on the [[Impact of historical migrations and cultural changes in Anatolia|conquest of Anatolia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.

The study of [[Historical and architectural influences between Trkiye and its neighbors|Anatolian architecture]], particularly through the lens of places like Ahlat, can offer profound insights into the region's complex [[Historical perspectives and cultural heritage of Turkey|cultural and linguistic history]] and the enduring legacy of its diverse peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.

## Early Archaeological Findings

Archaeological records show no information in Egyptian sources about the Jews being in Egypt or leaving Egypt around 1000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The Egyptian records are extensive and indicate a highly literate culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Around 1000 BC, during the supposed period of David and Solomon, Jerusalem was merely a shepherd's settlement with about 30 households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. There was no Hebrew script yet, with its emergence occurring much later, around 700-800 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Emergence of the Northern Kingdom

Around 800 BC, a highly developed kingdom emerged in the area north of modern-day Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This kingdom featured at least two significant cult centers and a rich aristocratic and royal class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This Northern Kingdom was completely destroyed by the Assyrians in 712 BC, becoming an Assyrian colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A significant portion of its population was exiled and settled around modern-day Mosul, while non-Jewish, non-Hebrew tribes were brought in as colonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Rise of the Southern Kingdom (Jerusalem-Centered)

Following the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, Jerusalem's population significantly increased, becoming an important city around 712 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. During this period, Jerusalem was not under Assyrian rule, and a kingdom centered there emerged, playing a political role for about 120 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This kingdom acted as a buffer state between Assyria to the north and Egypt to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Under King Manasseh, the kingdom entered a profitable relationship with the Assyrians, becoming a crucial source of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. After the collapse of the Assyrian State, the Babylonian State formed, and the Jerusalem-centered Jewish state played a role in the power balance between Babylon and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This significant kingdom, though relatively small, existed for approximately 130-140 years between 712 and 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Key Kings and Religious Development

### King Hezekiah (Hezek)
King Hezekiah reigned from 715 to 686 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Extensive information about him exists not only in the Torah and the Book of Kings but also in Egyptian and Assyrian sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Jerusalem experienced a significant population increase during his time, likely due to resettlement of immigrants from the North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

During Hezekiah's reign, the name "Yahweh" for God first appeared; previously, God was referred to as "El" and "Elohim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This period saw the initial stages of a new cult, a religious revival, and religious reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The prophet Isaiah, who first introduced the concept of the Messiah, was a key ideologist for King Hezekiah's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is understood that much of the biblical narrative was formed during this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### King Manasseh
Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, reigned for 40 years from 686-642 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Torah portrays him as a "bad guy" who strayed from monotheism, giving way to foreign gods and disregarding prophets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, archaeological and historical data indicate that his reign was a period of significant wealth, prosperity, and alliance with Assyria, benefiting greatly from the olive trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Wealthy houses began to appear in Jerusalem during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### King Josiah (Yosa)
Following a period of instability after Manasseh, his grandson Josiah became king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Josiah initiated an absolute religious reform, akin to a "Wahhabism movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. His first act was to eliminate all provincial shrines and small local temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. He pursued an imperial policy, seizing control of the north as the Assyrian state collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. According to the Torah, Josiah not only destroyed old temples in the north, such as the Baal Temple, but also exhumed and desecrated the graves of 40,000 Bethel priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Josiah's actions were driven by the belief that these places had fallen to "false gods" and deviated from the true religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. His chief ideologist was the prophet Jeremiah, described as a "Middle Eastern fanatic" who preached divine punishment for idol worship and deviation from true faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Jeremiah advocated for the destruction of stone temples and the concentration of all worship at the Temple in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This push for a single cult and single God, directed by Jeremiah, led to significant chaos, objections, and resistance within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Shortly after Josiah's death, the Babylonians devastated the kingdom in 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Jeremiah's Lamentations are seen as a defense against criticisms that his fanaticism caused the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Biblical Narratives vs. Archaeological and Historical Evidence

### Dating of Holy Texts
The oldest extant manuscripts of holy texts, such as the Torah, do not predate the 1st century BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. However, textual analysis strongly suggests that the core teachings and main body of the Torah were created during the reigns of Kings Hezekiah and Josiah, responding to the needs and polemics of that specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### The Conquest of Canaan
The Torah narrative states that the Israelites, led by Joshua, completely slaughtered the Canaanite people and destroyed their cities, including Jericho and Gibeon, with divine assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. However, other parts of the Torah indicate that Canaanite cities and kings still existed hundreds of years later, with ongoing conflicts and Israelites being punished for disrespecting Canaanite idols (e.g., King Ahab marrying Jezebel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This inconsistency suggests a deliberate internal polemic within the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### North-South Polemic and the Formation of Official History
Careful reading reveals that those who "incompletely" fought the Canaanites or worshipped idols were often northerners, while southerners were portrayed as more faithful to Yahweh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This suggests the text was written during a period of intense conflict between the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah), with the poorer southerners asserting their dominance in the religious narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The text served as an official history for the Southern Kingdom, especially after northern refugees swelled Jerusalem's population following the Assyrian destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It aimed to legitimize the Southern Kingdom by claiming an older, more sacred lineage through figures like David and Solomon, even though the Northern Kingdom had been historically richer and more established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The description of King David and Solomon's customs and palace life often reflects the Jerusalem of the 8th and 7th centuries BC, specifically the times of Kings Hezekiah and Josiah, rather than 400 years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### The Role of Moses
The narrative of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt served to further legitimize the Jerusalem-centered state. King Josiah's "discovery" of the book of laws in the Temple, which made a single temple mandatory and set rules for it, linked his reforms back to Moses, thus asserting a divine, ancient precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

The names Moses, Amram, Miriam, and Aaron are not Hebrew but likely Egyptian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. Moses is depicted as growing up in the Egyptian palace, possibly an Egyptian prince or noble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. The story of an Egyptian exodus, even if not a mass event, may reflect past connections or diplomatic needs with Egypt, which historically occupied the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. The narrative of ancestors defeating Egyptians and God punishing them likely had a political meaning in the context of struggles against Egyptian hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## Monotheism and Religious Evolution

### Early Monotheism in Israel
While Akhenaten's monotheism in Egypt predates it, the radical monotheism of ancient Israel, which demanded the destruction of other temples, was highly systematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. The Torah frequently condemns the worship of foreign gods (Babylonians, Phoenicians, Philistines, Canaanites, Assyrians) and highlights subsequent divine punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

Polytheism in that period often served as a diplomatic tool, where alliances or trade agreements involved respecting and even building temples for other nations' gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

### Political Drivers of Monotheism
The formation of the Torah coincided with a political movement opposing foreign alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Northern Kingdom Crisis**: The story of King Ahab marrying a Phoenician princess and building a vineyard temple, followed by Prophet Elijah's ideological war, destroying Baal temples and killing priests, reflects a foreign policy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This narrative emphasizes internal conflict over reliance on foreign gods.
*   **Manasseh's Assyrian Alliance**: King Manasseh's alliance with the Assyrians led to the weakening of Yahweh worship and the introduction of foreign idols into temples, reflecting the prosperity brought by Assyrian contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Josiah's Reforms**: King Josiah's radical purge of all idols and foreign temples, particularly in newly occupied northern territories, was a direct rejection of such foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

The archaeological record indicates no fundamental difference between Canaanites and Israelites; their languages were the same, and there's no evidence of a violent conquest and ethnic change as described in the Torah for the 1000 BC period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. The notion of two separate migrations (Abraham's and Exodus) followed by conquest is not supported by archaeology; instead, these people appear to have been indigenous to the region for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

## Post-Exilic Judaism and Persian Influence

The final edition of the Torah text and the establishment of the new Jewish state after the Babylonian captivity are strongly linked to Iranian influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. Ezra (Uzayr in the Quran) and Nehemiah, who were Iranian civil servants, played a crucial role in rebuilding the Temple and defining the Jewish religious institutions, cleansing them of old political conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. The very term "religion" used at this time (circa 530-520 BC) is an Iranian word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

Key theological concepts like Satan, hell, and the Sirat bridge (a concept from [[historical_religious_texts_and_interpretations | Zoroastrianism]]) emerged during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. The idea of an evil principle rivaling God is new, reflecting a clear Zoroastrian influence, which offered an attractive explanation for evil in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Evolution of Eschatology

In earlier books of the Torah, God's punishments and rewards are primarily earthly: destruction of enemies, protection of the land, and material well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. There is no concept of heaven or afterlife rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

Later books introduce the concept of the Messiah, who will come to establish a great kingdom, suggesting a future hope when earthly conditions are dire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. The idea of the immortality of the soul appears to be a later development, emerging around the time of Jesus, in Palestine and the Greek world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>. Discussions about the afterlife are more prominent in the Talmud, with some interpretations suggesting allegorical meanings for places like the "Valley of Tears" (likely the Valley of Hinnom in Jerusalem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

## Archaeology, Religion, and Reason

[[archaeological_evidence_vs_biblical_narratives | Archaeological evidence]] combined with textual analysis and records from neighboring countries allows for a skilled reconstruction of the historical narrative surrounding ancient Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. This approach aims to provide the most plausible and probable hypothesis for the origins of the biblical narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. This does not reject religion or faith, but rather seeks to establish a historically grounded understanding of its origins, allowing faith to exist within a framework of real-world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

Similar studies have been done for Christianity and are ongoing for Islam, examining the historical and textual evidence for their origins and prophetic figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. However, ancient Zoroastrian texts (Avesta) present challenges due to their oral transmission and later written forms, making it difficult to ascertain their health and exact dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The emergence of concepts like "Satan" and an organized afterlife in Judaism is strongly influenced by Zoroastrianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

The general phenomenon of religious and philosophical ideas spreading across cultures through trade and interaction in the ancient world is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. Ideas are adopted if they find "fertile soil" and meet the needs of a civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Understanding the true narrative of [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]] is challenging due to the carefully constructed story surrounding his life and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Powerful leaders like him typically do not give honest answers about their past, as they possess a strong will that shapes their own narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. An intelligent person, if they are the one telling the story, ensures that their narrative is not easily shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## Unanswered Questions and Gaps in the Narrative

Several periods in [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]]'s life raise questions about the official account:

### Return from Damascus and World War I Allegations
During World War I, while on duty on the Syrian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]] was allegedly involved in "dark events in the nature of Cemal Pasha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. [[allegations_against_mustafa_kemal_during_world_war_i | His name was implicated in a coup attempt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> and he was accused of corruption, specifically selling army horses and pocketing the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. He was subsequently pardoned from his duties and went missing for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This raises a significant question: why was the Ottoman Empire's most talented and successful commander left without duties during the war's most critical period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>? Approximately six months later, he was assigned a very sensitive and serious political task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Appointment as Vahdettin's Caretaker
In December 1917, [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] became the new Crown Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. As Sultan Re≈üad was expected to die soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] was sent on a long visit to Germany, an ally and protector of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]] was assigned as [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]]'s political caretaker, a very sensitive and vital task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This appointment is curious because [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]], over 60 years old at the time, had never been involved in politics and was described as a "shy, cowardly old gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Sending such a figure to meet the German Emperor during a life-or-death war, with [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]] as his escort, begs for explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### The Vienna Visit
In May and June of 1918, during a critical period of World War I, [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]] was sent on a long holiday and for medical treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Before Karlsbad, he stayed in a Vienna hostel for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. A diary from this period was surprisingly published, detailing mundane activities like taking walks and a dog barking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. It is peculiar that a commander holding significant and politically sensitive posts would be sent on a two-month holiday to Austria during such a crucial time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### The "Double Game" after Samsun
A key question involves [[mustafa_kemals_strategic_decisions_in_samsun_amasya_and_erzurum | Mustafa Kemal]]'s actions after going to Samsun, specifically if he "played a double game" all the way to Amasya and Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. He was sent by [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] and Damat Ferit Pasha with incredible authority and an important mission to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. However, he then "suddenly turn[ed] against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. The transition from being sent with a significant mission to turning against those who sent him is a crucial part of his self-crafted narrative that requires further explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

These inconsistencies and unexplained periods highlight how [[mustafa_kemals_early_political_and_military_career | Mustafa Kemal]], like many powerful figures, built and controlled his own story, rather than leaving it to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

At the beginning of a live stream, the speaker encountered several [[technical difficulties during live streams | technical difficulties]] related to sound and internet connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Initial checks were made to ensure the voice was audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and eventually, the sound quality improved significantly, receiving positive feedback from viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Despite these improvements, the speaker noted [[recurring technical issues and computer problems | recurring technical issues]] with the broadcasting device, stating, "Why is this device doing such nonsense? I have no idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The troubleshooting process involved:
*   Resetting the device, which was ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Turning the computer off and on, which resolved an initial issue but led to a new problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The internet failed to connect after the computer restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Random adjustments were made in the settings, described as "like a cat wandering around the piano keys," with no clear understanding of how the problem was ultimately resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

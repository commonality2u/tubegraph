## Background to the 1922 Migration

While the 1915 Deportation period did not generally apply to Istanbul, with only a specific incident on April 24, 1915, involving the arrest and disappearance of 150-200 people, a different wave of migration occurred in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The speaker's family, residents of Istanbul for generations, was not directly affected by the 1915 deportations in the same way, though the speaker's great-grandfather, a writer and publishing house owner, was briefly arrested and later released around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. An individual exiled during that period even hid in the speaker's grandfather's house for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The context of Armenian schooling in Istanbul also shifted; all Armenian schools in Istanbul were closed in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The speaker's grandmother, then in middle school, attended a school opened by French Jews for 2-3 years, where she learned French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Armenian schools reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## The Mass Exodus to France

Following the fall of Izmir to the Turks in 1922, a significant panic spread throughout Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This event triggered, for the first time, France's permission for the [[mass_migration_and_its_societal_impact | mass migration]] of Armenians from Istanbul to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This differed from the situation in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Consequently, Istanbul Armenians migrated en masse to France in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. In the months immediately after Izmir was taken in September 1922, people departed in great panic, packing onto ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Family's Experience in France and Return

The speaker's family, including their father's side, also traveled to France together during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This included the speaker's grandmother, siblings, and grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

After spending 2-3 years in Paris, the speaker's grandfather decided to return to Türkiye, feeling "bored" and aiming to revive his old publishing house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His publishing house, previously active in publishing translations of modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, was re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Bookstore and second-hand bookseller shops were opened in Beyazıt Square, near the current university's Faculty of Letters and Chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These shops remained well-known and beloved in Istanbul until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This account of [[Travel experiences in France and neighbouring countries | travel experiences in France]] and the return to Istanbul is based on stories heard from the speaker's grandmothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

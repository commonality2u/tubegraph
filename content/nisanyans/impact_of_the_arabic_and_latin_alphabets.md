The discussion surrounding the alphabet revolution in Türkiye often involves questions about its necessity and its distinction from the language revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Distinction Between Alphabet and Language Revolutions

The alphabet revolution and the language revolution are two entirely independent events in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The alphabet revolution occurred in 1927-1928, while the language revolution began in 1932 and peaked around 1935, indicating a four to five-year difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The language revolution's aim was to eliminate words of Arabic and Persian origin from Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Necessity of the Alphabet Revolution

The need for a script change in Türkiye emerged as early as the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Many sensible people in Türkiye began to view a writing revolution as a prerequisite for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Proposed Reforms to the Arabic Alphabet

During the First Constitutional Era (1908-1918), the Ottoman ruling classes explored various ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It was considered that the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] could be radically reformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, transforming it into a fully alphabetic script that expressed all vowels and consonants separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This included changing the shapes of [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic letters]] to be more independent, similar to Latin alphabet letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Influence of [[Cultural Westernization and Alphabet Change | Cultural Westernization]]

From 1850 onwards, the cultural landscape of Türkiye's ruling, cultured, and educated classes underwent a complete transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Their horizons shifted, with the West becoming their primary point of reference for new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Children of means were sent to Western cities like Geneva, Paris, and London for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Literary forms, fashion, scientific developments, political and legal concepts, journalistic styles, and article writing were all imitated or learned from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In this process of trying to align with Western norms, the idea of adopting a Western-style alphabet became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Challenges with the Arabic Alphabet for Turkish

The [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] posed significant problems for writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. While these issues could be overcome, the Latin alphabet adopted in Türkiye today is considered much more advanced than the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] for expressing the fine details of Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

One major issue was its inability to correctly write non-native words in Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. When attempting to write foreign words that did not match the sound structure of Turkish and Arabic, the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] would yield absurd results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. For instance, deciphering place names in old maps or tax records written in [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] often makes pronunciation unclear, leaving ambiguity about vowels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Debunked Arguments for the Alphabet Revolution

Two common arguments put forward for the alphabet revolution are often debunked:

1.  **Increased Literacy**: It is often claimed that the alphabet revolution increased literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, this argument lacks logical basis and cannot be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. For example, Iran preserved the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] for Persian, even though it is a foreign alphabet for Persian just as it is for Turkish, being incapable of expressing Persian sounds. Yet, Iran's literacy rate is comparable to or higher than Türkiye's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Similarly, Israel uses an alphabet with the same letters and structure as the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]], despite the traditional Jewish alphabet being Hebrew. Through systematic education, Israel achieved a nearly 100% literacy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Therefore, the alphabet revolution in Türkiye likely did not significantly contribute to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **Helped Westernization**: The argument that the alphabet change directly helped [[Cultural Westernization and Alphabet Change | Westernization]] is also not entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, when a country's cultural structure and orientation shift dramatically, strong pressure for a change in script would naturally arise, making it an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Emergence of Non-Arabic Scripts for Turkish

Another significant factor in the alphabet revolution was the growing use of non-Arabic scripts for Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. From the mid-19th century, a vibrant publication industry emerged in Türkiye using Armenian letters, and subsequently Greek letters, to write Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Many Turkish novels and newspapers were published in Armenian and Greek scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. These publications covered daily news, international affairs, market information, jokes, and poems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Many Muslims, or Turks, began to prefer reading these versions over those written in [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic letters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. They even learned the Armenian alphabet to read Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This preference stemmed from the fact that both the Armenian and Greek alphabets were significantly more successful than the old [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] at expressing the nuances of spoken language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. They were easier, more direct, and better at conveying meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

With increasing literacy in Türkiye, there was a real possibility of people shifting towards Armenian and Greek alphabets for Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This shift had to be prevented, and it was difficult to achieve this by simply reforming the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic alphabet]] or through a massive education campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Therefore, the alphabet revolution can be seen as an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

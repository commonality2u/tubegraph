The Pınar Gültekin case refers to the brutal murder of a young woman named Pınar Gültekin in Muğla, Turkey, approximately two years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Initially, the public perceived it as a straightforward brutal murder that evoked widespread sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. However, the speaker, after reviewing the case file, asserted that the incident was "completely different" from the public narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Case Background

Pınar Gültekin was a student at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University, described as having an active life and enjoying spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The perpetrator, Cemal, worked in the auto industry and sought to distance himself from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Cemal and Pınar met at a small bar in Muğla and engaged in an intense, short-lived relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Pınar subsequently requested money, and Cemal covered her rent and other expenses for about a year, typically between 500 to 1000 liras per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

When Cemal's business declined and he could no longer provide money, Pınar threatened to expose their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Over three to four months, she blackmailed him, demanding "serious figures" that reached 20,000 liras, which Cemal paid in installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This blackmail led Cemal to hate Pınar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## The Murder

Cemal killed Pınar, a crime he had planned for several days, despite his later claim of acting in anger due to insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. He took her to a farmhouse and strangled her to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Panicked about body disposal, he attempted to burn the body, but failing that, he tried to conceal it in a barrel with Kalekim, which was described as an "absurd comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## Legal Proceedings

The court's decision was based on the Turkish Criminal Law, where premeditated murder typically carries aggravated life imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. However, the law allows for a "provocation discount" if the crime is committed under the influence of an "unjust event, anger, and fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. The court ruled to apply this reduction, sentencing Cemal to 23 years in prison, which implies he will serve approximately 14.5 years in a closed prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

The prosecution and Pınar's family's lawyers argued for a charge of "torturous killing" because of the attempt to burn the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. However, the court found that the burning occurred *after* Pınar's death, thus not constituting torture during the act of killing itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Cemal's motive for killing was determined to be his extreme fear of his wife discovering his affair and the blackmail, as attested by multiple witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

The speaker highly praised the court's 130-page decision as "extraordinary," "clear," "consistent," and "written by intelligent people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. The court criticized lawyers for making "baseless and empty statements" that brought the case to the media level rather than focusing on legal merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

## Media Reaction and Public Perception

The case generated significant media attention and public outcry, largely fueled by what the speaker described as "false publications" and "propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The public narrative focused on "male violence" and "killing our women," with accusations that the court was a "male court" for giving a "provocation discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This public discourse was believed to mislead people into thinking the discount was given because the victim "showed her body" or similar misconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

The speaker attributed the widespread "fuss" to "the actions of the Witches gang" who deliberately aimed to deceive and mislead the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. This group, convinced of their own righteousness, openly presented lies as virtues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. The ensuing "shout" and "fuss" led to people "competing with each other to swear at both the child who is the murderer and the judges," driven by a lack of information and understanding of legal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that those who defend evil for the sake of evil are more immoral than those who commit crimes out of fear or anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

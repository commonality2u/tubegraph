From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The discussion around religion often elicits strong, negative reactions from opposing viewpoints: those who believe reason and religion are inherently at odds, and those who contend that asserting reason's independence from religion merely turns reason into another form of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Persistence of Religion

Despite significant societal changes, people continue to believe in religion, even when secularism and non-belief become viable social options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Empirically, this persistence is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Historical examples, such as 80 years of anti-religious propaganda in the Soviet Union, paradoxically led some to conclude that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For many, religion serves as a means to cope with the meaninglessness, oppressiveness, and falsehoods of public life, providing something to cling to when "nothing is real and no truth is accepted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## The Need for a Rational Approach to Religion

Representatives of rational thought do not have the luxury of ignoring or belittling the phenomenon of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Instead, there is a serious need to understand why religion is such a persistent and permanent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This involves:
*   Understanding the phenomenon of religion on a rational basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Discussing its boundaries and determining its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   Answering the questions that religion poses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

The speaker expresses a personal goal to establish an institution that approaches religion rationally, distinctly different from vocational theology faculties, which traditionally serve as propagandists for Islamic religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This endeavor is considered a "more important and serious step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Defining Rational Thought

Rational thought, often equated with the scientific method, involves the human mind's perception of truth through:
*   Putting forward assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   Testing these assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   Revising theories or seeking new ones when encountering contradictory results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Science, in this context, is defined by its method, where all propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. If a theory explains something well and no counter-evidence is found, it is accepted until a "brighter and more original view" emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

### Engaging with Religious Hypotheses

Rational thought can engage with religion by:
*   Attracting religiosity with rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Confining it within rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   Determining mutual boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Systematically exploring its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

When confronting religious claims, such as those about the birth of Islam, three methods are suggested:
1.  Accepting the hypotheses as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
2.  Taking them seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
3.  Falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The last method is considered more enjoyable and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Challenges in Communicating Non-Religiosity

Communicating non-religiosity to religious people is complex. Learning from institutions like the Jesuits, who are experts in conveying religion to young people indirectly, suggests an indirect approach might be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. They prioritize moral issues and psychological problems of youth, rather than direct doctrinal teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

Direct arguments aimed at destroying a believer's religiosity can be problematic, especially if there's "nothing to replace it with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. A more valuable and productive approach is to reinforce non-religious people or those undecided, rather than trying to convince devout believers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

## Secularism and Freedom of Expression in Turkey

In Turkey, since the beginning of the 20th century, non-religious individuals have largely adopted one of three approaches to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>:
1.  Dismissing religious people as not worth talking about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
2.  Believing that Atat√ºrk showed the right way, and religious people are traitors who need to be crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
3.  A continuation of the first, often associated with a focus on leisure activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

These approaches have left religion in the monopoly of religious people, leading to a lack of answers from non-religious individuals when confronted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. If dissenting opinions on religion are threatened and religious approaches gain political and cultural influence, then a "serious war" exists, demanding intelligent engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### The Debate: Rationality vs. Irrationality

The question arises: Can the irrational be defeated with rationality? The hope is to defeat irrationality and open doors for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. A key aim is to "place religion within the framework established by reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Evolution of Religion and the Role of Falsifiability

Early stages of religion appear to have a scientific component, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events, such as jinn causing people to get lost or gods influencing battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These "scientific hypotheses" do not have to be true, but they must be falsifiable and explain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

A significant turning point in the evolution of religion is Judaism, where God is portrayed as directly interacting with the world and history, making questioning God and religious stories politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This leads to a concept of God that is increasingly abstract and incomprehensible, rendering it impossible to falsify with real-world evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

Christianity further emphasizes belief *without* proof. The story of Thomas needing to touch Jesus's wounds to believe is contrasted with the ideal of believing without needing empirical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. To be a "real Christian" or "real religious" means believing in something without rational possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. The argument "I believe this, I am not obliged to question this, I cannot question this" is seen as the basic principle of faith, leading to a point where faith and reason cannot meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Positivism and the Infinity of Knowledge

The speaker criticizes positivism, which assumes that as knowledge increases, ignorance decreases, implying that all knowledge can eventually be attained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Instead, the speaker posits that as knowledge increases, so does the awareness of one's ignorance, likening it to perceiving the vastness of the sea the further one ventures into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. Knowledge is infinite, and the more one learns, the less one realizes they know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.

### The Quran and Historical Context

The Quran's statements, such as Mary being the sister of Aaron, are presented as data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Objectively, within the "natural flow of normal human actions," it is highly likely the Quran's writer confused two different Marys from historical texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. While alternative hypotheses (e.g., another Imran and Harun) are possible, they lack strong evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

During Muhammad's time, the Torah and Bible were known, at least by hearsay, and Christians were widely present in the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. It is plausible that Muhammad, likely illiterate, received information about these texts indirectly, leading to potential inaccuracies in his understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. The fact that errors in the Quran were not corrected later, despite opportunities, is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Conclusion: Reason and Religion

The core question remains: How can religion be surrounded by reason, made harmless within a "cocoon of reason," and how can reason be the "referee in this match"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. This requires not ignoring religion or dismissing it as worthless nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. The aim is to explain religious data through more rational, common-sense thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

Future discussions should delve into:
*   The origins of holy books like the Torah, Bible, and Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   The position of religion within [[human_rights_law | Human Rights Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.
*   The limits of [[freedom_of_expression_and_religious_criticism | freedom of expression]] in religious matters, referencing doctrines and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.
*   The current religious position in Turkey and how to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

The notion of a society confronting its past for social peace is debated. According to one perspective, the idea of "confronting the past wounds" is merely "shaving words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">00:03:55</a>.

It is asserted that no society truly confronts its past, and there is no inherent need for such confrontation to achieve social peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">00:04:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>. Instead, those in positions of power tend to impose their own version of history, their values, and their perspective on the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">00:04:16</a>. Those without power are left to "nag and complain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">00:04:24</a>.

This viewpoint suggests that the concept of confronting historical wounds is more about rhetoric than a practical necessity for societal harmony.

[[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalism]] is widely prevalent in the coastal regions of [[Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond these areas, its spread in inland regions is supported by two primary social bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. One of these significant bases includes civil servants and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Civil Servants as a Social Base for Kemalism

Civil servants constitute a key social group that contributes to the prevalence of [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This demographic is characterized by being educated according to [[Turkey]]'s averages, despite not necessarily being exposed to global culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalism]] resonates strongly within these segments, serving as a distinguishing factor from the general populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Geographic Impact

The career trajectory of civil servants in [[Turkey]] often involves postings across various regions. A 30-year civil service career can see individuals moving from their initial posting, for example, to Çorum, Diyarbakır, or Denizli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Upon retirement, many civil servants choose to settle in major coastal or western provinces such as Izmir, Antalya, or Bursa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Consequently, these provinces have a high concentration of retired civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Intergenerational Influence

The influence of retired civil servants extends to their children and grandchildren, creating an intergenerational link to [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_politics | Kemalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

It provides a sense of distinctiveness and perceived higher value compared to the average population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

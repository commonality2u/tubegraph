In the aftermath of natural disasters, the response and strategies employed by governments and leaders become a critical point of public scrutiny and have significant societal consequences. The devastating earthquake that struck Türkiye and Syria in February 2023 highlighted various aspects of this challenge, including perceived government incompetence, the psychological drivers behind blame allocation, and the strategic use of fear and hatred to maintain political control.

## Initial Response and Perceived Incompetence
The initial response to the earthquake in Türkiye was widely criticized for its shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The government's actions, particularly those of the state's leader, were characterized by a combination of arrogance and incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The leadership was perceived as displaying "insensitivity and meanness" in their public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, with criticisms suggesting that the state's bureaucracy and even armed forces demonstrated behaviors indicative of an inability to effectively manage the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This led to accusations of creating an "incompetent and stupid order" and failing to take necessary precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Instead of focusing on relief efforts, the state's "natural reflex" was seen as threatening, spreading hatred, and humiliating its own people to secure "miserable political advantages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Blame Allocation and Psychological Responses
Following major disasters, there is a natural human reflex to seek a culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, a phenomenon historically observed after events like medieval plagues where groups such as Jews were blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In Türkiye, this instinct manifested in two main ways:
*   **Blaming Syrians:** Some attributed the disaster's consequences to Syrians, portraying them as "naughty looters" who do not share national feelings, inciting a desire for their destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Blaming Contractors:** Others, particularly those identifying as more "elite" or "left-leaning," blamed contractors for poor construction practices and inadequate enforcement of zoning laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The speaker personally saw no fundamental difference between these two blame styles, viewing both as a search for a scapegoat driven by a "culprit needs to be sought" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It's argued that finding a single source of fault in a complex system where individuals operate within limited budgets and market pressures is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The responsibility for construction quality involves multiple actors: property owners, contractors, and zoning bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Leadership Strategies and Political Instincts
The long-standing political leader in Türkiye, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is described as possessing strong political instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. However, his response to crises is characterized by operating in a "hate mode," relying on threats and "spewing hatred" as primary statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This approach is seen as damaging the country's "moral settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

A theoretical justification for such behavior might stem from Machiavellian principles, where it is argued that it is "better to be afraid of the Presidency than to be loved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Love is seen as an "unstable and slippery foundation," while fear is a "much more successful management tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. It is pondered whether the government's response, particularly the leader's unsettling public appearances, was a calculated decision to ensure state authority and public fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This includes diverting public anger away from the government itself, potentially towards easily targetable groups like the construction sector or, more pragmatically, "incapable of defending themselves" refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Such a strategy might be considered "smart policy" to prevent "unpredictable results" like the destruction of a vital economic sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

## Impact on Democratic Processes and Opposition
Despite the severity of the disaster, there is skepticism about whether it will significantly weaken the current leadership's political position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. The ability of the leader to arbitrarily close universities demonstrates a lack of any legal order and an absence of effective opposition capable of challenging the "current accumulation of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. The 21-year rule of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is largely attributed to the lack of a "proper alternative" opposition, with existing alternatives like Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu described as political merchants lacking vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>.

## Role of the State in Urban Planning and Safety
The disaster highlighted fundamental flaws in Türkiye's urbanization policies. The prevailing reinforced concrete construction, dominant since the 1960s, is described as a "humanitarian disaster" in earthquake-prone regions, making cities "uninhabitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The state's duty to create "decent and healthy living space" for its people is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. It is argued that individuals or private entities cannot create such spaces due to limiting legal frameworks, bureaucracy, and the "social and legal structure based on making money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. The current system prioritizes profit and adherence to minimal laws over broader public responsibility for quality of life and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. The dilemma presented is a choice between capitalists driven solely by profit and civil servants who, if given more power, could worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Trust in Authorities and Conspiracy Theories
The widespread emergence of conspiracy theories during the crisis is linked to a fundamental erosion of trust in official information sources and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. When political leaders, experts, and media are perceived to consistently lie or serve biased financial interests, public trust is shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. This leads people to seek alternative explanations, often producing hypotheses or "theories" when official narratives lack credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. Evaluating such theories requires considering:
1.  **Knowledge of how relevant authorities operate:** Do those proposing theories have a realistic understanding of bureaucracies, political decision-makers, and public health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>?
2.  **Distinction between truth and hypothesis:** Do proponents understand the difference between an absolute truth and a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>?

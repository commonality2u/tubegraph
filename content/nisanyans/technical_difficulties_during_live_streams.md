Technical challenges can arise during live broadcasts, impacting audience access and presentation.

## Initial Broadcast Problems

The host experienced initial difficulties with the live stream, noting that the video was not visible to them, despite the broadcast appearing to have started [00:00:06]. There was uncertainty about the broadcast's visibility to the audience, with the host asking, "can we see the video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> and expressing concern that viewers might not be able to see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## "Members Only" Mistake

A significant [[technical_issues_with_live_streaming_and_internet_connectivity | technical issue]] arose when the broadcast was inadvertently set to "members only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The host explained the predicament: "as we broadcast only for members only since I am not a member of my own thing I can't get into the management thing of my channel so that I can reopen the site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This oversight prevented them from directly managing the channel settings to correct the audience restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Resolution

After some effort, the issue was resolved. The host acknowledged this as a "little [[technical_issues_with_live_streaming_and_internet_connectivity | technical incompetence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, confirming that the broadcast was no longer restricted to members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Other Technical Glitches

During the stream, additional [[technical_issues_and_challenges_in_podcastvlog_production | technical issues]] surfaced:
*   **Mouse Issues** The host noted, "your mouse is about to break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>, indicating potential [[recurring_technical_issues_and_computer_problems | computer problems]].
*   **Display Problems** There were persistent difficulties in displaying a map on screen, leading to repeated attempts to make it visible to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

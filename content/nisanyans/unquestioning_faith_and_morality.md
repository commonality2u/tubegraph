Unquestioning faith is defined as believing in something impossible, even when it is proven wrong, or holding onto a belief that cannot be given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It signifies the ability to maintain a belief despite contradictory evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This form of faith requires trust in something that the mind cannot comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

## Faith and Moral Understanding

Unquestioning faith can sometimes conflict with basic understandings of morality and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. A classic example is Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his own son because God commanded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This act is presented as the epitome of Abraham's faithâ€”submitting without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Such narratives suggest that unquestioning faith, or "unquestioning obedience," can be woven into human and community life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Conflicts with Rationality
The concept of unquestioning faith often stands in opposition to a skeptical and questioning perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Arguments are generally considered ineffective against faith, as faith maintains belief even when faced with counter-evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

> "If unquestioning obedience is the ability to maintain a belief despite women against faith and this is exalted... you can never fight in faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>

Religious concepts are not necessarily rational concepts and do not need to be consistent with rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Genuine faith may imply a complete disregard for the rational mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. For example, the Jewish religion contains extraordinarily complex rules that lack logical reasons beyond "God commanded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. These incomprehensible rules are followed solely due to God's inaccessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

Examples of beliefs requiring unquestioning faith include:
*   Conception from a virgin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   Resurrection three days after torture and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

If one believes unconditionally, simply because it is stated, then they are considered a believer and will be "saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This often means abandoning personal attachments, family, and possessions, and concentrating all existence on the singular spiritual existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Faith and Religious Texts

Historically, the reliability of religious narratives was initially based on ancestral transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, this was deemed unsatisfactory because ancestors are human and fallible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. To achieve greater certainty, religions evolved to claim direct divine intervention as the source of their hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This development, roughly 2000-2500 years ago, meant that if a message came from God, it must be indisputable and absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It implies that one cannot argue with God's word, even if it appears irrational or nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

Later, written sources became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. A "direct message" transformed into a set of verbal statements and written scriptures, requiring belief even if not outwardly apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This leads to a situation where a scientific or critical mind must either accept the "crooked" elements or interpret them to align with reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

In the Jewish tradition, the Torah, consisting of the first five books, includes historical events and a set of laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Other parts of the Hebrew Bible, such as the Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings), include historical accounts, prophecies, wisdom literature (like the Book of Job, which emphasizes not losing faith despite tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>), and even love poetry like the Song of Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. These texts demonstrate a long, evolving textual tradition, with some parts exhibiting mixed languages and dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Modern critical analysis of biblical texts, particularly from the 18th century Enlightenment era and later, has shown that many narratives, like the creation stories in Genesis, contain internal contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Archaeological findings, particularly from the 1970s and 80s, suggest that much of what is considered official history in these texts is actually a "mythology" created for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. For example, evidence indicates that Jerusalem was a small shepherd settlement, not a grand kingdom during the time of David and Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, and that a complex societal structure required for writing these epics did not exist then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. This critical approach implicitly challenges the basis for [[philosophical_and_ethical_considerations | unquestioning faith]] by examining the factual basis of its narratives, which touches upon the [[loyalty_to_the_truth_in_historical_and_cultural_narratives | loyalty to the truth in historical and cultural narratives]].

Nonetheless, the concept of unquestioning faith remains a powerful force in many [[role_and_perception_of_religion_in_society | religious and philosophical discussions]], often leading to [[philosophical_discussion_on_morality | philosophical discussion on morality]] and [[comparison_of_religious_and_secular_values | comparison of religious and secular values]].

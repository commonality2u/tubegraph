Kemalism, while widespread in coastal areas of T端rkiye, also has a significant social base among specific groups in inland regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:02]</a>. One of these groups is the [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevi community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Historical Homeland and Demographic Shifts
Historically, the [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevi community]]'s homeland was concentrated in inner Eastern Anatolia, specifically regions like Sivas, Malatya, and Tokat, where their population was dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, since the 1980s, systematic oppression has led to a significant exodus from these traditional [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevi homelands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Consequently, very few [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevis]] remain in regions like Sivas and Malatya today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Many migrated to Europe, while a large portion moved within T端rkiye to major cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, and the Aegean region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Kemalism as a Symbol and "Last Holdout"
For the [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevi community]], particularly in the present day, the symbol of Kemalism serves as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This association is rooted in their experience with an ideology that has historically ignored, disregarded, and excluded them from the state and citizenship in T端rkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Despite these challenges, [[Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey | Alevis]] view themselves as the rightful owners of T端rkiye and its state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The adoption of Kemalist thinking has become their "last holdout" and their sole hope for not being oppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This stance is described as understandable and humane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Understanding their adherence to Kemalism, similar to understanding why people are Muslim, requires empathy and the ability to maintain distance from ideological conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

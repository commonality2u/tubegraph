## The 100th Anniversary of the Republic

The 100th Anniversary of the Turkish Republic was anticipated to be marked by grand ceremonies and enthusiastic celebrations, with expectations of significant [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | political events]], such as the declaration of a new constitution [00:01:48]. However, these expectations largely went unfulfilled [00:02:16]. Compared to the 80th and 90th anniversaries, the 100th was observed as an ordinary and unimportant event, reflecting what appears to be a government policy [00:02:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While a small group attempted to generate excitement through demonstrations and social media posts, the general sentiment across the country suggested that the anniversary held little widespread significance [00:03:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This muted celebration is viewed as the "right policy" from a historical perspective [00:03:50].

## Continuity and Change: Ottoman Empire to Republic

From a broader historical lens, the Turkish Republic is considered an "episode" within the continuous flow of the [[political_history_of_Turkey | history of Turkey]] [00:04:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Similar to France, which transitioned from a kingdom to a republic, or Russia and China, which underwent significant regime changes, fundamental continuities often outweigh differences [00:05:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The name "Türkiye" has consistently been used by foreigners to refer to the region, regardless of its official state name [00:06:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The state's historical narrative demonstrates continuity, linking figures like Fatih, Yavuz, and Abdulhamid to Mustafa Kemal and Tayyip Erdoğan [00:07:43]. Furthermore, institutions such as the Turkish Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police Organization, land registry, and population administration show an obvious continuity through regime changes [00:08:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Republic of Turkey is seen as a "revised version" of the Ottoman State adapted to new conditions [00:09:09].

The collective identity of the people, previously known as "Muslims," largely overlapped with the later adopted identity of "Turks" [00:09:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Externally, Ottoman Muslims (excluding Arabs) were consistently referred to as Turks by their neighbors and European observers [00:10:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The ruling cadres of the Republic were largely continuous with those of the old state, with graduates of elite schools and commanders establishing the new regime while maintaining state continuity [00:11:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Ottoman laws, increasingly reformed based on European models since the 1840s, also continued into the Republican period [00:12:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Republic also assumed the debts of the Ottoman State, and many Ottoman traditions, customs, and habits persisted [00:12:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The dominant language, Turkish, remained, although its usage style underwent significant reforms from the 1930s onwards [00:13:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Sociological Transformation

One of the most significant changes attributed to the Republic, a continuation of a process initiated by the Tanzimat reforms, was the radical shift in the structure of society [00:15:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. In the Ottoman State, the Muslim/Turkish segment was considered the "Sovereign Nation" over other coexisting nationalities [00:16:02]. The process of removing non-Muslims from the Turkish Anatolian and Rumelian population began in the 19th century, intensified before the Republic, and continued until the 1980s [00:17:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This deep [[cultural_and_political_transformations_in_turkey_and_its_periphery | transformation]] aimed for the previously sovereign segment to become a single nation, profoundly altering the sociological structure and state ideology [00:17:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### Administrative Cadre Expansion

A second major change, also a continuation of processes begun during the Tanzimat, was the expansion of the modern state's duties and the corresponding need for a larger and more diverse bureaucratic staff [00:20:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. This global trend, seen throughout the 20th century in various regimes (monarchies like Iran, Jordan), led to a tremendous increase in the literate population capable of administrative work [00:21:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. After a period of stagnation during Abdulhamid's reign and wars from 1908-1923, there was a significant increase in the number of people integrated into state cadres [00:22:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This expansion, from perhaps 10,000 to 100,000 literate individuals in administrative roles, marked a quantitative increase in education [00:23:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. These new administrative segments, often from Anatolia and Rumelia, became loyal supporters of the Republican regime, seeing it as their savior [00:24:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This phenomenon, however, is not exclusive to the Republic; it would have occurred under any regime (sultanate, communist) [00:26:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

### Revolutionary Enthusiasm and its Limits

Turkey experienced a "great revolutionary excitement" in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly among its administrative cadres [00:27:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This was fueled by the collapse of the old regime, wartime defeat, and a global sentiment post-World War I to abandon outdated institutions and rebuild societies on rational foundations [00:28:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Such revolutionary spirits were present in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, China, and Germany [00:29:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

However, the "revolutionary enthusiasm" in Turkey, which lasted until the 1940s, largely resulted in "much talk and little action" [00:29:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. In contrast, Russia under Catherine the Great and Stalin demonstrated profound [[exploration_of_western_and_turkish_political_dynamics | transformations]], building cities and institutions from scratch through mobilization, even by force [00:30:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. Turkey's claim in 1923 to reach the level of contemporary civilization mostly faded by 1938-1939 [00:33:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The reforms were superficial, and the administrative cadres were insufficient [00:34:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. A significant portion of the Republic's founders amassed wealth through the elimination of non-Muslims, primarily focusing on protecting their gains [00:34:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. While Mustafa Kemal Pasha and a small core tried to instill dynamism, the wider founding generation reverted to traditional styles after his death [00:35:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. The failure is attributed to the inadequacy of administrative cadres, rather than the sociological infrastructure [00:36:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

### Change in Head of State Election Method

A specific and distinguishing feature of the Republic was the change in the method of electing the head of state [00:37:08]. Historically, it was widely accepted that large states required a strong leader, usually determined by hereditary succession to prevent conflict [00:37:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. However, this model collapsed globally at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly after World War I, with monarchies in Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and China giving way to republics [00:38:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

The "fashion of the age" or necessity led to the principle that elites, with public approval, could elect a head of state [00:39:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. While theoretically this involved periodic changes (like in America), in Turkey and many other countries, those in power often sought to retain it [00:40:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, for instance, served as president for 15 years [00:41:13]. Despite this shift in succession methods, the actual real-world results in terms of overall development are not seen as significantly different from monarchies [00:41:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Iran, which maintained a monarchy, showed a similar development process to Turkey between the 1920s and 1970s [00:42:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. The problematic continuation of hereditary monarchy in Iran led to instability due to the "unbalanced personality" of Reza Shah [00:42:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Jordan, another monarchy, also shows similar development rates in education and literacy to republican regimes [00:43:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Development Metrics: A Global Trend

Progress in areas like decreased child mortality, increased life span, rapid population growth, improved public health, higher literacy rates, urbanization, and increased university graduates are universal developments of the 20th century, not specific achievements of the Turkish Republic [00:44:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. These trends show no significant correlation with a country being a monarchy or a republic [00:45:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. Countries like Japan (monarchy) and Nigeria and India experienced similar development evolution [00:47:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. These are products of new state understandings, increased state influence, developments in transportation and communication, and the astronomical demand for educated personnel, all seen globally throughout the 20th century [00:47:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

In summary, the two most important changes from before to after 1923 were the transformation of Turks from a sovereign nation to a single nation and the expansion of educated public cadres [00:48:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. These changes would have occurred regardless of the republican regime [00:49:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. The "excitement of a revolution" in the 1920s and 1930s affected only a narrow segment and ultimately "failed" [00:49:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Therefore, viewing the Republic's centennial as a "very important turning point" or a "matter of existence and non-existence" is not considered serious [00:50:22].

## The 1990s in Turkey

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the Özal movement ushered in a period of "liberalism" in Turkey, emphasizing wealth creation, enjoyment, and less focus on traditional values [01:21:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. The world's rapid integration made international travel easier, fostering an optimistic outlook among the country's middle and upper classes [01:22:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. This era saw the emergence of new cafes, restaurants, and consumption alternatives in Istanbul [01:23:07]. There was a dominant feeling that Turkey would integrate with the West and join the European Union, overcoming the "dark ideological obsessions" of the 1970s, with expanding freedoms of press and expression [01:23:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.

However, this optimism gradually gave way to pessimism by the mid-1990s [01:24:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>. The Kurdish issue escalated significantly around 1993, leading to a terror campaign, deportation policies in Eastern provinces, destruction of villages, forced migration, and assassinations of Kurdish writers and businessmen [01:25:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. The military re-entered [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | political life]] with renewed tyranny and oppression [01:25:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. This dark period worsened throughout the 1990s, eventually leading to the explosion of the existing [[turkish_political_climate_and_elections | political party]] system, from which the Justice and Development Party emerged around 2000 [01:26:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:31">[01:26:31]</a>. The 1990s are summarized as "not a good period" [01:26:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

## Turkey's Place in International Relations

### The 1919-1922 Greco-Turkish War

The conflict between Turkey and Greece from 1919-1922 is framed within the context of [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | broader international dynamics]]. A war between Turkey and Greece, even with Turkey's exhaustion and poverty, was expected to result in a Turkish victory given Turkey's larger population (4 times Greece's), larger economy (3-4 times Greece's), and long-standing military tradition [00:58:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. The real concern in this war was the extent of British involvement, as the British and French allies had driven the Greeks into the field [00:59:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>.

This war is compared to the current Ukraine War, where Russia's outcome against Ukraine is clear, but Ukraine is supported as a pawn of the Western alliance [00:59:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Similarly, Greece was pushed forward by allies who promised support but withheld direct military involvement [01:00:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. When success was not achieved, military and financial aid to Greece was gradually cut off [01:01:20].

The "great pageant" and "national epic of defeat" surrounding the Greek War were largely due to Mustafa Kemal Pasha's political calculations [01:02:05]. He presented the final clashes, especially the Battle of the Commander-in-Chief, as his personal success and used it for propaganda to lay the foundation for his [[turkish_politics_and_political_figures | political future]] and path to dictatorship, commencing on August 30, 1922 [01:02:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### The Gallipoli Campaign (Çanakkale)

In March 1915, the British and French allied navy attempted to cross the Dardanelles but failed [01:03:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. They subsequently landed land forces on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915 in a "crazy project" driven by "extreme arrogance and pride," which ultimately failed [01:03:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. Their primary objective was to capture Istanbul within 48 hours by passing through Çanakkale, aiming to remove the Ottoman Empire from World War I [01:04:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. Another unspoken concern was to prevent a potential Russian operation towards Istanbul [01:05:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. Landing in Izmir was not a viable alternative as an army has never historically marched from Izmir to capture Istanbul due to the long distance and high risk of being blocked [01:05:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. The Çanakkale campaign was an "opportunist move" with a small force, which failed [01:06:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

### Contemporary Geopolitics and Turkey's Stance

There is a serious danger of war, and countries often engage in posturing to deter opponents [01:36:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>. Iran, known for its boasting, seems likely to be forced into a war, which it is predicted to win [01:37:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>. Turkey, aware of a serious threat of war, most likely wishes to avoid involvement [01:37:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. It sends mixed signals, with the President organizing a Palestine rally while Turkish warships participate in NATO fleets in the Mediterranean [01:38:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>. Turkey is likely aiming to remain neutral by maintaining a "smiling face to both sides" [01:38:34]. If a new Palestinian order is established, Turkey desires to play a role as a guarantor, patron, or supporter, though this is deemed difficult given the Arab world's likely rejection [01:38:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>.

## Critique of Official Historical Narratives

The prevailing discourses about Turkey's [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | history]] and identity are criticized as "stupid lies" [01:28:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. People often feel a gap between what they learn in school and what they hear from older generations [01:28:38]. Researching the past of Turkey's 45,000 settlements, purifying oneself from official lies, and moving beyond narrow ideological molds is considered a crucial endeavor [01:29:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

Behind the official ideology's imposed identity of Turkey, there are numerous human stories and cultural divisions in every region [01:29:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>. These include Arabs and Kurds, Laz and Chileans, old greengrocers and Circassians, Yörüks and Turkmens, and Alevis with Sunnis [01:30:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>. These divisions, clashes, and envies constitute the "real history of the country," lived by its people [01:30:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. However, the entire education curriculum and official national ideology deny these realities, forcing them into a "stupid narrative" or myth [01:31:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. Discovering and revealing this true history, even at a local level, is seen as a "revolutionary service" that challenges the official narrative of the Republic and integrates it with world events [01:31:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>.

## Introduction to Modern Freedom and its Roots

The concept of freedom, particularly in the Western world, has undergone significant transformations over the centuries. In the modern era, the understanding and implementation of freedom have been shaped by a series of revolutions and societal shifts.

### The Western Claim of Freedom
For the past 250 years, the Western world has strongly asserted a claim of freedom, making it attractive globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:31">[03:03:31]</a>. This attraction has led people from the [[Islamic world | Islamic world]], India, China, Russia, and Africa to view the West as a "Pole of freedom" from the 1750s until the early 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:04">[04:11:04]</a>.

However, the speaker expresses skepticism about the contemporary notions of moral and political freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:58">[02:50:58]</a>.
*   **Moral Freedom**: The idea that an individual can form their own value judgments and live accordingly is largely considered an illusion, except in Hollywood movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:40">[02:56:40]</a>. Value judgments and actions are often shaped by upbringing, accidents, fate, coincidences, and societal currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:11">[02:57:11]</a>. Individuals tend to justify their behaviors with theories *after* adopting them, rather than deriving them from free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>.
*   **Political Freedom**: The belief that individuals can change or limit political power by their own choice is described as a "deception" and an "illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:45">[02:58:45]</a>. Societal changes are seen as collective phenomena, not the result of individual choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Three Revolutions Defining Modern Western Freedom
Modern Western freedom is viewed as a result of three significant revolutions:

1.  **The French Revolution (Symbolic Event)**: Beginning around the 1720s, with the symbolic event of the [[French Revolution | French Revolution]], individuals in Western society declared independence from the coercive dominance of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:52">[03:11:52]</a>. This shift occurred after a 200-year civil war in Europe, where it was understood that Christianity could not be defeated, leading to a compromise that allowed individuals to free themselves from religious obligations without blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:10">[03:33:10]</a>. This freedom spurred significant developments in science, knowledge, and political ideas by liberating thought from the moral constraints of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:54">[03:39:54]</a>. However, it also led to negative outcomes, such as a decline in high arts and music in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>.
2.  **Post-World War I Urbanization**: The second revolution unfolded after [[World War I | World War I]] (around 1918) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>. It was driven by massive rural-to-urban migration and the growth of gigantic cities like London, Paris, Berlin, New York, and Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:45">[03:55:45]</a>. People gained "anonymous freedom" in these cities, shedding the responsibilities and moral concerns of local identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:36">[03:58:36]</a>. This led to radical changes in clothing (especially women's fashion, becoming "extremely provocative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:26">[03:37:26]</a>), normalization of extramarital affairs, and the rise of art movements (like Cubism and Surrealism) aimed at shocking people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.
3.  **The 1968 Revolution**: The third revolution was the 1968 revolution, rooted in a rapid increase in university populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. This diluted the traditional function of university life, which previously concerned a small, socially responsible segment of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. As a result, large segments of society embraced tremendous freedom in sexual morality, asserting the right to have sex freely and terminate relationships at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:13">[03:53:13]</a>. The development of birth control methods significantly reduced the risks associated with sexual intercourse, further expanding this new world of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:56">[03:53:56]</a>.

These three revolutions collectively pushed religion into the background, eliminated traditional local identity pressures, and liberated sexual life, leading to the "tremendous attraction" of Western societies based on freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:24">[04:04:24]</a>.

### Current Challenges to Western Freedom
At the present juncture, there is serious concern about the sustainability and positive outcomes of this "freedom climb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:22">[04:22:22]</a>. The speaker questions whether the current state of freedom has produced good results for humanity, both collectively and individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:59">[04:29:59]</a>.

Historically, rules, institutions, and customs that restrict human potential also provide a framework for social unity and common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:25">[04:32:25]</a>. While stretching this framework can increase freedom, completely destroying it can lead to collapse and dispersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:56">[04:39:56]</a>. It is suggested that the West's 250-year journey of freedom has reached a "bankruptcy point" or "collapse point," making it necessary to re-establish certain things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>.

## Freedom Before Modernity: Western vs. Ottoman/Islamic Worlds

### Western Pre-Modern Freedoms
Even before modernity, the West was considered a "home of freedoms" with fundamental principles of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:51">[04:49:51]</a>. The concept of freedom, theorized since the Middle Ages, became a pillar of Western political thought from the 12th and 13th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:08">[04:59:08]</a>.

Two key aspects of pre-modern Western freedom include:
*   **Feudal Independence**: The relative freedom of powerful political figures (e.g., lords, kingdoms with armies) from the king, operating on principles of mutual respect and boundary adherence. This differs from the later concept of "citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>. This fragmented political structure of Europe, where rulers struggled for centuries to centralize authority and taxation, fostered this relative independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:19">[04:47:19]</a>.
*   **Separation of Church and State**: The principle that religious authority (the church) is independent of the state (the ruler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:05">[04:53:05]</a>.

By the 16th century, an abstract model emerged in Europe: "we are the civilized European countries that are free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:02">[04:58:02]</a>. This was often contrasted with the [[Ottoman Empires modernization and westernization | Ottoman Empire]], where ruling classes were civil servants whose power and wealth could be seized by the Sultan, unlike European feudal lords who were property owners and could challenge rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Islamic World Before the Ottomans
The speaker highlights a recent interest in the [[Cultural Transformation in the Middle East Turkey and Iran | Islamic world]] before the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:25">[05:25:25]</a>. When comparing the "Bright Age" of the [[Influence of cultural and religious dynamics in the Middle East | Islamic World]] (e.g., the Seljuks, the period of principalities) with old Europe's freedoms, "no difference" is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:27">[05:46:27]</a>.

This earlier [[Impact of political and historical contexts on Middle Eastern societies | Islamic world]] was structurally similar to European feudalism, with fragmented power shared among many layers and armed feudal lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:52">[05:08:52]</a>. Importantly, in terms of relative freedom of religion against the ruler, the [[Role and perception of Islam in modern society | Islamic world]] was considered more advanced than Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:27">[05:12:27]</a>. It had a theoretically and legally defined area of freedom that no religious ruler would violate, fostering a clergy class largely independent of the ruler's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:38">[05:13:38]</a>. The term "military type" or "denigrated" often refers to a new style of government that emerged in Eastern and Islamic countries after the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:22">[05:22:22]</a>.

## Modernization and Challenges in Islamic Societies

### Contrasting Russia and the Ottoman Empire's Reforms
A fundamental question arises regarding why reforms like those of Peter the Great in Russia, which were permanent and transcended ages, could not be replicated by leaders like Atat√ºrk or Mahmud II in the [[Social and economic changes in the Ottoman Empire | Ottoman Empire]]/Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

*   **Similar Starting Points**: In the early 18th century, Russia and the [[Ottoman Empires modernization and westernization | Ottoman Empire]] were similar in size, state structure, ideological problems, and development levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. Russia made a significant leap in reforms and transformed into a major modern power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, despite attempts at reform (e.g., during the reigns of Ahmet III and Selim III), experienced a 100-year delay before reforms truly began under Mahmud II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.
*   **Difference in Modernization Leadership**:
    *   **Russia**: The engine of change and modernization was carried by the politically dominant Russian ethnic group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. New artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen were primarily Russians or operated under a Russian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
    *   **Ottoman Empire**: The leadership of change and modernization was taken by Christian elements (Greeks, Armenians, Christian Arabs, Serbs, Bulgarians), who were religiously and socially distinct from the state's dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. These groups achieved similar levels of modernity to Russia, establishing Western-style institutions and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. However, unlike Russia, a growing conflict between these modernizing groups and the political power led to mutual massacres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. The modernizing forces became "enemies of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia's New Modernity Claim
The speaker observes an "incredible revolution" currently taking place in the Arab world, particularly in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Prince Salman, despite his controversial actions (e.g., chopping up opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>), is presented as a "moderate" figure in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

Saudi Arabia is projecting itself as a pioneer of modernity, distinct from the West, which is seen as "finished" and unable to manage basic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. This is exemplified by ambitious architectural projects like a huge cube-shaped building and "NEM," a giant, self-contained desert city in the aesthetic of a space base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. While the realization of these projects is uncertain, their conceptualization and marketing are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has radically cut ties with its traditional patrons, England and America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>. They have made agreements with Iran, readmitted Syria to their midst, and declared they will not use dollars for trade with Russia and other markets, instead using Chinese currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. They have also refused to participate in sanctions against Russia, asserting their independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.

This shift represents a claim by Saudi Arabia to be the "representatives of modernism" and the "leading power of the new age" in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. They aim to determine the next stage and horizons of humanity without abandoning Islamic labels and traditions, such as building the world's most modern structures in the shape of the Kaaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>. This suggests a potential for a "new type of secularization" or something entirely different from Europe's historically conditioned model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.

### Conclusion on Global Power Dynamics
The speaker believes that the current global situation marks the potential "end of the Western world as we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. These [[Political shifts and changes in global power dynamics | political shifts]] and [[Western Cultural History and Modern Challenges | cultural transformations]] suggest a fundamental reordering of global power dynamics and societal paradigms.

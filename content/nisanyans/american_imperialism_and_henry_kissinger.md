Henry Kissinger's death at over 100 years old was a noteworthy event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Even in his final months, he undertook a significant diplomatic mission to [[historical_perspectives_on_americanchinese_relations | China]] for important, undisclosed meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Kissinger's Legacy and Perception

Kissinger is often characterized as "the devil himself" in discussions criticizing [[modern_geopolitical_conflicts_and_alliances | American imperialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, left-leaning critics of [[neoconservatism_and_american_foreign_policy | American foreign policy]] (especially during the Vietnam War and the Chilean coup) strongly opposed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

However, after the 1990s, when "real American world hegemony got out of hand," Kissinger was no longer in active duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In this later period, he became a critic of [[neoconservatism_and_american_foreign_policy | American foreign policy]], delivering consistent and academically framed criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Interestingly, Vladimir Putin and Chinese officials offered the most powerful and sincere comments about Kissinger, describing him as "an enemy we respect" and "a man of brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. They lamented that the [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | United States]] and Western countries no longer produce individuals of his caliber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Kissinger's 100-year life story largely mirrors the rise and peak of the American Empire and what is known as Pax Americana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The American world order was established during his youth, reached its peak during his career, and began its decline as he neared the end of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. He symbolized an era of sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## The Establishment of the American Empire

American sovereignty was not a spontaneous development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Beginning around 1940-1942, before America entered World War II, the [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | United States]] systematically and consciously established its global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This involved building economic infrastructure, institutions, political structures, ideology, and military alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Following the catastrophic period of 1918-1938, American leaders resolved not to repeat past mistakes and aimed to establish a world order under their control – economically, militarily, and intellectually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Importing Cadres for Empire Management

To execute this vision, the Americans lacked sufficient cadres and thus "imported" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. After World War II, highly qualified young individuals were brought from Europe, particularly from Germany, Eastern Europe, France, and England, and placed in influential positions within the American system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Key sources of these imported talents included:
1.  **German Jews:** Many, like Kissinger himself, were born in Germany and lived there until adulthood before moving to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
2.  **Other European Migrants:** Figures like Zbigniew Brzezinski (from Poland) and Madeleine Albright (another Secretary of State during Clinton's era) also migrated to the U.S. after reaching maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

These imported individuals were integrated into the system and specifically trained within three core institutions:
*   **Military:** Talented soldiers from World War II, like Kissinger, were transferred into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Intelligence Organizations:** Individuals trained within intelligence agencies were selected and promoted, with Kissinger being one such example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Elite Academia:** Graduates from prestigious universities like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia served as academic researchers and idea producers before being promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

This practice of importing people continues today, as seen in the diverse backgrounds of leaders in countries like the UK (e.g., Indian Prime Minister, Scottish First Minister of Arab/Kurdish descent, London Mayor of Pakistani descent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Evolution of American Leadership and its Implications

A significant difference exists between the American leadership of the 1940s and today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. In the 1940s, a cadre of administrators still came from the old American elite—Protestants from Northeastern states like Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania—who formed a kind of American aristocracy with strong Protestant religious feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. These individuals were seen as "straight, vulgar, and moralistic," unlike the European-style diplomats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Until the Kennedy era (1960s-70s), this native aristocracy held the helm of the country, setting targets and determining boundaries, even if they were hypocritical in their moral discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

While [[neoconservatism_and_american_foreign_policy | American imperial policy]] was largely carried out by imported individuals, this dual structure meant a native aristocracy provided a moral discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Kissinger, in his doctoral thesis on Metternich and Castlereagh (19th-century British and German diplomats), admired the European approach to interstate balance policies, contrasting it with Americans' lack of understanding due to their comfortable upbringing and wide horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The American Empire's establishment benefited from this tension between American ideology and European governing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Many European intellectuals who ran the Empire came as refugees from war, massacre, tyranny, and concentration camps, viewing America as a symbol of hope and liberation, and were fiercely loyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

Today, the situation is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The old American aristocracy has largely disappeared, having no function in state administration, with many now engaged in rentier activities or leftist fantasies without actual political roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. The new generation of imported individuals did not come to America unconditionally for liberation; they came for money, career, and material comforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This shift in motivation results in a significant "difference in quality" and perspective for those leading the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## International Relations: Legitimacy and Stability

Kissinger's doctoral thesis, as well as the theories of other influential figures like Brzezinski, highlighted a core principle derived from European history (e.g., Congress of Vienna 1815, Bismarck's policy): the fundamental goal in the international system is to achieve a "legitimacy consensus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. This means establishing a system where the world's great powers find the principles acceptable and reasonable, leading to a stable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Conversely, a situation where one or more powerful states deem the order unacceptable leads to instability and war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

The European order of the 1920s was unstable because major players like Germany and the Soviet Union viewed it as illegitimate, lacking a common value system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. In contrast, the 19th-century European system was stable, preventing major wars for nearly a century because its key states reached a consensus on legitimate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. The establishment of such a consensus is the basic condition for an empire and a world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Decline of the Current World Order

Currently, this perspective and the idea of a common value system have "completely gone bankrupt" and disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The war in Palestine and Gaza is seen as the "last straw," leading major states to conclude that the existing situation and balance of powers are unacceptable and illegitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. This conflict is viewed as the culmination of a process that began in 2001 with the Twin Towers attack and the Iraq War, representing the accelerating collapse of the current world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### Foreign-Born Managers of the American Empire

Individuals born abroad can become managers of the American Empire, even if they cannot become President or reach the highest domestic political positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. To do so, one must become fully American, think like an American, and make American state interests the sole goal of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Personal family history or narrow cultural preferences should not influence state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. For example, a discussion with Brzezinski revealed concerns about his innate anti-Russian sentiment, questioning whether it was based on rational American state interests or personal Polish animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

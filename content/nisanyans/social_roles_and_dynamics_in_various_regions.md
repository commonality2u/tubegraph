## Religious Communities and Societal Influence

The influence of religious figures and communities on societal dynamics can be significant. CÃ¼bbeli Ahmet Hoca, for instance, is recognized as an "extremely intelligent person" who "thinks fast, reacts quickly and understands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He holds a "convincing position with convincing arguments" among a "very wide segment" of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

In a contrasting context, the Naqshbandi Community, specifically its Halid branch, played a "tremendous role" in the 19th century in [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkish lands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This period saw a "great social upheaval" after the collapse of the old aristocratic and Kurdish model, with the Naqshbandi order contributing to the "recovery of Islamic fanaticism" and the "restoration of a social order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These religious centers, such as the old Seyit Taha Dergah in Nehri village, were "very striking" and "beautiful places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, with a "spiritual" impact on generations of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The Naqshbandi community, particularly the Ismail Aga Community, was "extremely active" in prisons, organizing "lonely, hopeless people" and supporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Many prisoners are abandoned by families, lack money, and have "no hope of salvation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, making spiritual and psychological support invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Historical Social Structures

### Ottoman and Middle Eastern Context
Historically, regions conquered by Islamic empires, including Anatolia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, North Africa, and Spain, were acquired through "military colonization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. The objective was to "establish dominance... as a ruling class" and extract labor and surplus value from the local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Muslims often remained a minority in these conquered lands for a significant period (e.g., Baghdad during Harun Rashid's time, Egypt during the Mamluk State, the Ottoman Empire under Fatih Sultan Mehmet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Despite being a minority, they held authority, including the right to carry weapons, and did not aim to destroy or forcibly convert the local Christian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Instead, non-Muslims were expected to "work and... pay tribute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.

In the 19th century in [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkish Land]], Armenian and Kurdish histories became intertwined, leading to some Armenians collectively accepting Islam and adopting a Kurdish identity, speaking the Kurdish language, and joining the Naqshbandi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Those who "insisted on Christianity had to pay a terrible price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### African and Asian Contexts
In contrast, in places like Ethiopia, Sumatra, Indonesia, and Malaysia, Islam spread not through conquest but via merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. Here, Muslims were minorities who held "certain privileges within the society" but lacked "political sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

In Ethiopia, the "main mountainous part," including landowners, farmers, administrators, and the educated class (university graduates, district governors), are primarily Christian and members of the Tawhid church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. Conversely, Muslim communities often dominate the "bazaar shopkeepers and merchants" in towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>, resembling the role of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Muslims in the Ethiopian countryside are described as a "small minority," more "respectful," "polite," and possessing a "more dominant culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

Similarly, in [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | Sri Lanka]], the state and agricultural sectors are controlled by Buddhists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. However, jewelers, street vendors, hotel owners, and grocery store owners in towns are generally Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

## Modern Social Dynamics

### Individualism and Self-Realization
The concept of "individual's self-realization" is dismissed as "just empty talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. The primary purpose of marriage is stated as "to have children and raise children" to "ensure the continuation of the generation," which is also seen as a "duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. The only "real and morally valid goal in life" is to consider what one can give for another human being to "grow up, live in safety, become a man and a woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.

> [!info] Personal Reflection on Modern Society
> Ninety percent of what is said about "the role of the individual and so on" in modern society can be summarized as "how can I be more gasoline" (a euphemism for selfishness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. This focus on selfishness is not considered a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

### Gender Roles and Monogamy
Regarding [[human_reproductive_behavior_and_social_dynamics | human reproductive behavior and social dynamics]], the ideal of monogamy is a "fact that both men and women have," though it is "generally much stronger in women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. Men are described as having weaker reasons for upholding this ideal, but "most of the men, at least at some point in their lives, carry the feeling of 'I wish I had wheels, I wish I could achieve the ideal life of monogamy'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. When they do not comply, they feel "guilty and uncomfortable" and try to conceal their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. It is stated that men having heart relationships outside of marriage is common, while it is "not very possible in today's society" for women to be monogamous throughout their lives, although it was more common in "a more traditional society environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.

### Mental Health and Social Support
In modern society, the opportunity to talk about troubles and memories, which can be psychologically healing, is "greatly restricted" because people are "encouraged to live an isolated and lonely life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>. This has led to the emergence of "institutional chat services" where people pay to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>. This contrasts with traditional forms of sharing problems like gossip, or confession to a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

Regarding individuals with mental disabilities, the question of whether to provide pedagogical and rehabilitation support or allow them to be "mascot[s] of the neighborhood" is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. While the latter is considered a "better life than being a number one," it's acknowledged as a difficult subject for which an expert opinion is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

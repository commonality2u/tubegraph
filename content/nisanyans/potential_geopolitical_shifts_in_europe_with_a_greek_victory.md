The question of whether the Turkish National Movement could have been revived if the Greeks had captured Ankara and overthrown the organization there is a matter of speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Greek Objectives and International Context

During the War of Independence (1919-1922), Greece was initially promised only the province of Izmir and the district of Ayvalık on the international platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. There was no broader agenda for Greece to permanently settle beyond these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. While some individuals in Greece might have harbored such dreams, it was not the stance of sensible echelons with administrative responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

The landing of Greek troops in Izmir and Ayvalık was decided at the Paris Peace Conference a few days before May 16, 1919, primarily to maintain public order in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This was considered a police operation, and Greek flags were not raised in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The objective was also to provide a safe haven for Greek refugees deported from the Aegean Region by Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Major powers like Britain, France, Italy, and America never suggested permanent annexation of these territories to Greece at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Izmir and Ayvalık were placed under Greek security until a peace treaty could be finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## The Treaty of Sevres and Greek Military Expansion

The Treaty of Sevres in 1920, described as a "strange text," envisaged a 5-year occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, followed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This implied that these territories would be ceded to Greece after the transitional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

However, the wider Greek military operations in 1920 and 1921, which saw the Greek Army advance beyond Izmir province to invade Nazilli, Bursa, Aydın, and reach the Sakarya River, were different in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The aim of occupying Western Anatolia was not annexation but to force the Ankara government to surrender, bargain, or be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. It was a punitive and intimidation operation intended to make Ankara accept the Treaty of Sevres or its renegotiated versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## [[hypothetical_outcomes_of_a_prolonged_greek_occupation_in_anatolia | Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory]]

If the Greek operation had been successful and Ankara had fallen, leading to the surrender of the Ankara army and the withdrawal of Mustafa Kemal and his associates as political players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, the following [[Middle East geopolitical shifts | geopolitical shifts]] could have occurred:

### Reshaping Treaties and Governance
*   The Treaty of Sevres, which was considered "stillborn" and a bargaining/threatening document, would have been reformulated to reflect the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   Victorious Greece would have secured Izmir and the Aegean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   A consortium or collective management committee, potentially involving Greeks, would have been formed in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

### Shifting Alliances and Conflicts
*   The victory of the Greeks would have elevated England to the sole diplomatic player in Turkey, further widening the already strained relationship between France and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   This could have led to "an endless and bottomless conflict" between France and England, with Italy aligning with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Turkish Response and Future Geopolitical Alignment
*   Despite defeat, the Turkish population, which constituted the overwhelming majority of the country, would not remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   An advanced Turkish administrative class (officers, academy graduates, governors, ministers, journalists, professors) would engage in a gradual struggle through economic, social, political means, propaganda, and organization to seize the country's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   British management would likely involve using Greece against Turkey, attempting to play both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   After 20 years, a Turkey established under British rule would likely resemble other European countries like Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, and Austria, joining an "avengers camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. They would seek revenge for their perceived mistreatment in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   Given the opportunity in 1938-1939, such a Turkey would likely have joined the war on the side of Germany, potentially altering the entire history of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Unlikelihood of a Decisive Greek Victory
At the time, the possibility of a definitive Greek victory against the Ankara government was not taken seriously by most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. While the Greek army and the re-established Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) army were roughly equal in terms of soldier numbers (around 190,000-200,000 mutually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, key factors made a prolonged Greek victory unlikely:
*   **Demographics:** Türkiye's population was 4-5 times that of Greece at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Economy:** Türkiye's economy was at least 3 times larger than Greece's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term War:** In a prolonged conflict (longer than 1-2 years), Greece had no chance of winning against Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   **Military Tradition:** The Turkish army possessed a centuries-old war and weapon tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Political Homogeneity:** The political population of the Turks in the Aegean Region was overwhelmingly Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

The only chance for the Greek army was a swift "lightning" victory with strong and immediate weapon, equipment, and financial support from England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This quick victory would have aimed to disband the unorganized Ankara government and its fledgling defense system before it could establish itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. However, once the conflict dragged on and became a stagnant frontal war after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece's chances disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. This reality was understood by the British, French, and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

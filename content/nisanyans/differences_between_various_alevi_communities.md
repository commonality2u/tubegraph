The exact number of Alevis in Turkey is not clearly known, with estimates ranging from 8 million to 10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This diverse community comprises several distinct groups, each with unique characteristics, origins, and beliefs.

## Major Alevi Communities in Turkey

### Anatolian Alevis (Turkish Alevis)
Approximately 4 to 4.5 million Alevis are identified as Turks from Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Kurdish Alevis (Zazas)
Around 4 million Alevis are Zazas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. There is a slight indication that Zazas may have been Turks in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A significant portion of Kurds joined the Alevi uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Arab Alevis (Nusayris)
A third important community is the Arab Alevis, known as Nusayris, located in the south, specifically Hatay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The Nusayris constitute a large community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In terms of their [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism beliefs]], they hold a much more radical line compared to the Anatolian Turks and Zazas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Historically, Nusayris have been described as having nothing to do with Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Many Christian converts, ancient Arabs, and Christians from the coastal part of Syria joined this movement because the new model suited them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Thracian Alevis (Albanian Origin/Bektashiism)
In Thrace, there is an element of Albanian origin, possibly originating from intermittent Southern Albania and Bektashiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Most people in this region are inclined towards [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Tahtacılar
The Tahtacılar are an Alevi element found in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Their origins are completely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, although they speak Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. There is no clear information on when they emerged or how they took shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A French researcher concluded that the Tahtacılar are an element that remained before the arrival of the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical Context of Alevism

Alevism emerged as a widespread rebellion movement across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria at the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This movement can be seen as an opposition to Islam, sheltering itself under a form of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It incorporated old Turkmen elements who had been in constant rebellion since the 13th century, refusing to pay taxes to the state or bow to state-sanctioned teachers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Many groups, including a large part of the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, Armenian converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, and Nusayris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, joined this uprising.

The constant oppression, massacres, and banning by authorities led to the integration of these diverse groups into a defensive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This oppression fostered the formation of secret codes, solidarity organizations, and a distinct [[cultural_evolution_of_alevi_society | Alevi culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Historical Misconception
> Claims that [[alevi_religion_and_beliefs | Alevism]] is an Islamic interpretation of an old Turkish belief or that Alevis are descendants of ancient Turks are considered fraud and have nothing to do with the historical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This idea is described as a "mental pathology" that emerges when Alevis, not feeling part of the Muslim ummah and fearing Sunnis, cling to a "Turkism" fairy tale as a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

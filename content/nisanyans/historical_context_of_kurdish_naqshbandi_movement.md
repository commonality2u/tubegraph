The [[role_of_naqshbandi_sheikhs_in_kurdish_history | Halidi movement]], generally known as the [[role_of_naqshbandi_sheikhs_in_kurdish_history | Naqshbandi movement]] in Türkiye, is a deep and significant subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:23">[02:28:23]</a>.

## Origins and Revival

The Naqshbandi movement was revived by Mevlana Halidi around 1830-1840, when it was in a stagnant state in Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:02">[02:57:02]</a>. Mevlana Halidi was a significant guide and saint who trained many students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:11">[02:59:11]</a>. Almost all of his students were Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:20">[02:59:20]</a>.

## Spread and Establishment in Kurdistan

In the next generation, these Kurdish students began establishing their influence in various parts of Kurdistan in the 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:24">[02:59:24]</a>. Notable figures included Siddik Abdullah, Sheikh Subatullah Arvasi, Taha, Hakkari, and Şemdinli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:35">[02:59:35]</a>. They established lodges ("oil fields," likely a mistranslation for religious centers or lodges) in places like Nurşen near Muş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:04">[03:00:04]</a>. With the support of the Ottoman government, particularly Abdulhamid, these lodges rapidly gained power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>.

Within two to three generations, they formed a network that almost completely enveloped and took control of the Kurdish region, becoming the most powerful political formations with a feudal sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:21">[03:00:21]</a>.

## Background: Tanzimat and Principality Dissolution

This rise of the Naqshbandi movement occurred against the backdrop of the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:41">[03:04:41]</a>. Starting from the time of Mahmud II, just before the Tanzimat, the traditional Kurdish principalities, which had existed from the 12th and 13th centuries and acted as de facto independent entities (collecting their own taxes and maintaining armies), were systematically destroyed by the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:46">[03:04:46]</a>. This crushing of the Kurdish dynasties led to a period of great chaos and upheaval in Eastern Türkiye, also known as Eastern Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:08">[03:12:08]</a>.

### Social Order and Armenian Population

During the period of Kurdish principalities, the social order in regions like Muş primarily consisted of Armenian villagers, who were the vast majority of the population and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:45">[03:14:45]</a>. Kurdish tribes roamed the mountains, and a few Kurdish villages were strategically located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:08">[03:20:08]</a>. Although Armenians often complained about the Mirs (princes) and Beys, they had established a familiar status quo and balance with these rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

When this balance was disrupted by the Ottoman crushing of principalities, a terrible period of chaos and significant losses ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>.

### Impact of Naqshbandi Lodges

When the Naqshbandi lodges re-established sovereignty from the 1830s to the 1870s, their relationship with Armenian villagers differed from that of the previous Mirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>. During this period, a significant portion of Armenian villagers in Eastern Türkiye (which was largely synonymous with Armenia at the time) converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:45">[03:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Under the previous civil Mirs, Armenians had their own churches, monasteries, and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:23">[03:39:23]</a>. The Ottoman government and the Abdulhamid regime appreciated and supported the Naqshbandi sheikhs due to their role in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>.

The contemporary Menzil Dergah is described as a link in a chain that extends from Halidi Baghdadi to Sebatullah, and from there to Nurşin and Adıyaman, having brought a new vitality to this tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

This history highlights a crucial aspect of [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | Turkish and Kurdish relations in modern Eastern Anatolia]], where understanding such social structures and historical events is vital for comprehending the region's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:15">[03:51:15]</a>. However, this knowledge is not widely disseminated in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:15">[03:51:15]</a>.

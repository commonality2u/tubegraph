The adoption and evolution of surnames among Armenians in the Ottoman Empire reflect significant [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | cultural and linguistic shifts]]. Prior to the late 18th century, it was rare for Armenians in the Ottoman Empire to have surnames, with exceptions primarily found among the aristocracy and elite [00:00:44]. The common individual would be identified by their given name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas," similar to how Turks were identified at the time [00:00:58].

## The Surname "Revolution"

A notable shift occurred around the 1820s when all Armenians rapidly began acquiring surnames, and from that point, they were recognized by these new designations [00:01:06]. This phenomenon, which has been termed the "Armenian surname revolution" or "surname reform," lacks extensive published research, prompting a call for a doctoral thesis on the subject [00:00:34].

A striking aspect of this change was that almost all these newly adopted surnames were Turkish [00:01:28]. This was due to a significant [[changing_religious_and_cultural_dynamics_in_turkey | cultural dynamic]]: by 1828, Turkish was the mother tongue for the overwhelming majority of Ottoman Armenians [00:01:35].

While a major educational campaign in the 19th century later revitalized Armenian as a cultural language [00:01:45], in the 1820s, many Armenians either did not know Armenian at all, or it was a language reserved primarily for church or specific situations [00:01:56]. The common language for public interaction and commerce was Turkish [00:02:14]. As surnames needed to be declared to neighbors including Turks, Kurds, and Greeks, Turkish was the practical and prevalent public language [00:02:38].

Most of these surnames, acquired in the first quarter of the 19th century, were either professional titles or descriptions of personal characteristics [00:03:08]. Examples include:

*   **Professional Surnames**: Pastırmacıyan (from *pastırmacı*, "pastrami maker"), Deveciyan (from *deveci*, "camel driver"), Nalbantyan (from *nalbant*, "farrier"), Terziyan (from *terzi*, "tailor") [00:00:06], and terms like "shoemaker" or "shrimp exporter" [00:03:46]. Armenians commonly adopted professional names as surnames, reflecting their typical occupations, unlike Turks who were often engaged in official duties or were villagers [00:03:54].
*   **Characteristic Surnames**: Boduryan ("shorty"), Boşgezenyan ("idler"), Çolakyan ("one-armed") [00:00:11], or other traits like "loquacious," "lame," or "toothy" [00:03:29].

While a few adopted patronymic surnames like Sarkisyan or Hagopyan [00:02:58], the vast majority reflected occupations or physical attributes.

### Later Shifts and Regional Differences

Purely Armenian surnames were initially rare [00:04:15]. However, influenced by modern nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some families with Turkish surnames changed them to Armenian equivalents, such as changing "jeweler" to "Kenvosgeriyan" [00:04:23]. Despite these later changes, the truly old [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenian history and relations]] surnames predominantly remained Turkish [00:04:41].

Interestingly, Iranian Armenians also largely followed the Ottoman Armenian trend, adopting Turkish surnames [00:04:48]. A notable difference, however, is that Iranian Armenian surnames often end with a 'T' sound, as in 'yant,' distinguishing them from the 'yan' ending common among Ottoman Armenians, which highlights the cultural differences between the two empires [00:05:02].

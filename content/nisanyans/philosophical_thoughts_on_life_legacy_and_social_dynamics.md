## The Nature of Legacy and Permanence

The concept of legacy and permanence is seen as a fundamental drive for human happiness and connection to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Despite the reality that nothing one does in life truly holds meaning in the face of death, as everything will eventually disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>, the "dream of permanence" is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

This dream manifests as the desire to leave a lasting impact on society, community, family, and descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This feeling, though irrational, is deeply ingrained and essential to recognize, understand, and develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. A person without a "sense of lineage" – the desire to leave something for their children and for their name to be carried with pride by future generations – is considered lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. Aiming for this form of permanence is a valuable pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

The speaker expresses doubt regarding the "moral fortitude" of those who state they do not wish to have children, labeling them as "naughty people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. To be a useful person, one must possess the conviction that there are people to leave behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Without a belief in inheritance, not merely monetary but of fame or legacy, an individual cannot be consistent or moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Such an existence, reduced to mere consumption, is deemed "miserable, very meaningless," and inevitably leads to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

### Challenges to Legacy in the Modern World

The ability to sustain a grand legacy, such as a palace, across generations faces significant challenges in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Two basic conditions are identified for maintaining such a project:
1.  **Solid, long-term income source:** Major income sources in the modern world are highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Bank accounts or stock market investments are uncertain over decades, subject to inflation, government seizure, or company bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Agricultural income, derived from land, is presented as the only truly permanent source of income that can be transferred across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
2.  **Many children:** A large family increases the likelihood that at least one child will be capable and willing to continue the work and preserve the legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

The speaker notes that modern society often fails to meet these conditions, making the creation of enduring beauty and legacy difficult, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The example of Claudio Bravo's palace in Morocco highlights this; after his death, lacking heirs, the palace is expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## Social Dynamics and Class Structures

### Evolution of Turkish Society and the Republic

The Republic's "great effort and success" was the creation of a middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This middle class comprised urbanites who were sufficiently literate and qualified for civil service or professions like law, medicine, or accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This modernization project, which began in the 19th century, aimed to establish a middle class where one previously did not exist in the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

Before the Republic, Ottoman society was structured into classes: peasants, tradesmen, warriors/state administrators, and clergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. The 19th-century modernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire had started to create a non-Muslim middle class, which was largely destroyed in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. The Republic then sought to create a new middle class composed of Turkish Muslim peasants and townspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This segment became the primary advocates for the Republic's reforms and ideology, known as Kemalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

However, the Republic regime did not bring equality of opportunity or prosperity to the large peasant and working classes until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. A significant criticism leveled against the Republic is its failure to cultivate a "ruling elite" in addition to a middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Elite education, distinct from middle-class education, is crucial for those responsible for managing societal boundaries and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. The Republic, it is argued, feared and suppressed such individuals, leading to a society with a large middle and proletarian class but "no heads, with cut heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. This is seen as a "great shame" that has left the country behind the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

### Political Loyalty and Identity

The discussion of Turkishness and Kurdishness reveals differing social dynamics related to state loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. Turkish identity is strongly tied to loyalty to the state, with successful Turks historically distinguishing themselves through state service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

Conversely, Kurdish culture is characterized as a "feudal culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. This refers to a history of "different opposing local small-scale political formations and their endless struggle with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>. Unlike Armenian feudalism, Kurdish feudalism lacks a unifying church institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. Instead, various branches of the Naqshbandi order since the late 19th century have attempted to foster a cultural unity among Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

This distinction implies that a powerful individual like Atatürk, if born a Kurd, would have faced a choice between fighting other Kurdish factions or attempting to align with Turkish state structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

### Power and Leadership Dynamics

The discussion on what constitutes a "mafia boss" highlights key traits in wielding power: loyalty, reliability, and the ability to protect friends while being ruthless with enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. Power, especially illegal power, requires immense strength and the ability to cultivate unconditional loyalty from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. This unconditional loyalty is fostered by reciprocating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. The capacity for brutality is seen as an extension of reliability, necessary to deter betrayal and eliminate obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

### Gender Dynamics and Violence

Contrary to popular belief, the speaker asserts that "male violence against women is not a big problem" nor the "main problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. Instead, [[Philosophical and ethical considerations | female violence against men]] is deemed "a much more serious, much more deadly problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Cautionary Note
> This perspective on gender violence is a highly contentious viewpoint and deviates significantly from widely accepted sociological and psychological understandings of domestic violence.

It is argued that women rarely use physical violence and that when they do, they are often perceived sympathetically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. Instead, women allegedly apply psychological violence to gradually "darken their lives" and "extinguish the light of life of the men in their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This is likened to a praying mantis, where the female consumes the male after mating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

The speaker suggests that most incidents of violence against women, including murders, are "a cry of desperation" by men defeated in psychological warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. It is proposed that the introduction of "restraining orders" in Turkish law around 2006, which allow a woman's unilateral statement to be sufficient for removal of a man from his home, has led to an astronomical increase in injuries and murders against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This is considered "the most despicable act of humiliation that can be directed at a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. Despite the lack of academic research on this, the speaker's observations from prison experiences with men arrested for domestic violence strongly support this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.

## Economic and Political Systems

### Planned Economy and Freedom of Expression

The speaker sees no reason why a planned economy and freedom of expression cannot coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It is asserted that "all economies are planned," and the concept of a "free market" is largely "a propaganda formula invented by the Americans after 1945" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Large-scale investments are always subject to political will and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. No society, it is argued, can sustain its economy without control, as this would negate the need for a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This view aligns with [[Political and social commentary on international relations | political and social commentary on international relations]].

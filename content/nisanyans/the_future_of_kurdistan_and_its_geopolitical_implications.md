A significant event, described as a milestone in 21st-century history, has occurred in Syria, resulting in a major geopolitical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This development signifies a substantial victory for the United States and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, while representing a considerable defeat for Russia, Iran, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Turkey has also gained a certain, albeit small, advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

## Emergence of a Kurdish Region in Syria

Among the primary beneficiaries of this geopolitical shift are the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. It is now understood that Syria will likely feature a structure comprising at least two distinct regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. This includes a Syrian state centered in Damascus and Aleppo, predominantly controlled by Hay ºat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>, and a **Kurdish region** located east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>.

This [[political_and_military_implications_of_regional_ethnic_changes | Kurdish region]] is expected to be largely independent in its internal affairs, resembling a "second Kurdistan" akin to Northern Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. The speaker expresses satisfaction for the Kurdish community, congratulating them on this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

The Kurds are anticipated to play a significant role in the new Syria, becoming one of the two key players at the negotiation table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

### Geopolitical Implications for Turkey

As a result of this new formation, Turkey will inevitably have to compromise with and accept this new structure in Syria, ultimately engaging in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. This aligns with the speaker's assessment that Turkey, facing a dominant American-Israeli alliance, opted to side with the victors, a choice deemed wise given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>.

The speaker previously did not believe in the future of "Syria Kurdistan" but acknowledges being wrong in that assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.

The possibility of a **Kurdish region** bordering the sea is raised, but its feasibility is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>. Regions such as Azaz and Afrin are under Turkish control, and Manbij is also a factor, making direct access to the sea challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. Further south, the presence of Alawite Arabs in Tartus and Latakia also poses questions regarding Kurdish expansion to the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:29:00">[41:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>. However, if Kurds achieve an active and powerful role as part of Syria's ruling coalition, coastal access could become possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>.

### International Support and Reliability

News has circulated about Donald Trump inviting the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to a coronation ceremony, which is seen as a significant symbolic event signifying American backing: "we are behind you" and "trust us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>.

Russia's reliability as a partner for the Kurds or any other actor has been severely undermined by recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>. Russia's actions have revealed its limited capability to project significant military force beyond its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>.

## Challenges for Syria's Future

The Syrian people are largely seen as the ultimate losers of this conflict, though peace could potentially make them winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. The establishment of a central authority in Syria, especially after the collapse of state authority and the rise of various groups, appears very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Re-establishing state authority after such a collapse is considered one of the most challenging tasks globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. It is believed that such a process cannot occur without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. If efforts to avoid bloodshed are made, Syria risks fragmenting into numerous pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. A strong, decisive leader capable of enforcing authority is deemed necessary to restore order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.

## Turkish Nationalism and [[Change in Kurdish perspective on Armenian issues | Kurdish Issues]]

The speaker states that the basic instinct guiding secular Kemalist people in Turkey regarding the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish issue]] is Turkish racism and nationalism, with secularism being a secondary aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

Turkey's policy on the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurds]] is described as a dead-end, asserting that "there is no such nation as Turks and [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurds]], [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurds]] are part of the Turkish nation," and that those who claim otherwise are deemed "terrorists and traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:09:00">[48:09:00]</a>. This policy is compared to the Ottoman Empire's World War I policy of "Turks and Arabs being brothers and one nation," which ultimately ended in disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>.

## The Printing Press and Societal Transformation
The invention of the printing press and the subsequent proliferation of printed materials profoundly impacted societal structures. The classical narrative suggests that the printing press fostered a more autonomous and widely spread information environment, leading to a more vocal and free world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

However, post-liberal perspectives argue the opposite: that the printing press strengthened central control mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. It provided managerial cadres with an opportunity to guide and "herd" human societies by determining the content of printed material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The speaker, however, disagrees with this view, stating that asking whether the printing press restricted social freedoms is a legitimate question, but the answer is no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Impact in Europe
In Europe, the effects of the printing press have been extensively debated and analyzed for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The advent of the printing press led to a fragmentation of the world of ideas, previously controlled by the church, and an increasing liberation from ecclesiastical control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Impact in Turkey
In [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkish culture and Ottoman culture]] for 200 years, the printing press led to information becoming more autonomous and spreading widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Its arrival in Turkey is linked to:
*   The emergence of a central bureaucracy and professional classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   The development of state-determined formal education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   The rise of an educated elite class with distinct cultural preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   A radical shift in the production of cultural narratives from religious institutions to new classes of writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### Language and Social Hierarchy
The printing press also had significant, unexpected results on language history, particularly in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[01:14:19]</a>. It led to:
*   **Shift from Latin to Vernaculars:** Latin, previously the common cultural language for literature in Western Europe, became insufficient due to a wider audience's inability to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. This created a need for new cultural languages closer to spoken dialects, expanding the market for books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Standardization and Fixation:** Printed languages were quickly standardized and fixed, allowing texts to be read across generations and regions. For instance, English spelling was chaotic until the 16th century, but the printing press introduced a new standard language that slowed its evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:46]</a>.
*   **New Social Hierarchy:** The standardized printing language became the language of the capital and administrative staff, creating a hierarchy where regional dialects were deemed "second-class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. In Turkey, this led to Istanbul Turkish becoming the dominant cultural language, marginalizing dialects like Antep Turkish and Erzurum Turkish, which were increasingly stigmatized as "the language of ignorant people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

## [[political_dynamics_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Sheikh Said Rebellion]] (1925)
The Sheikh Said rebellion is viewed through several narratives:
*   The leader of the Kurdish national movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>.
*   Provocation by the British to destabilize the new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   A rebellion by religious bigots demanding Sharia law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

The speaker offers a different perspective: Sheikh Said, far from being an ignorant village imam, was a member of one of the most prestigious and powerful aristocratic Kurdish families, with extensive lineage and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>. The rebellion, in this view, was a response to a profound sense of betrayal by the new Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of Kurdish Governance
From the 16th to the 19th century, the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire (east of the Euphrates) were largely ruled by autonomous Kurdish principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[32:15:00]</a>. These beyliks (e.g., Hakkari, Botan, Bitlis) functioned as de facto independent states, collecting their own taxes and maintaining armies, while theoretically paying tribute to the Ottomans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. Ottoman pashas in key cities like Erzurum and Diyarbakır struggled to assert central authority over these resilient Kurdish lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12:00">[34:12:12]</a>.

### Ottoman Centralization and the Rise of Naqshbandi Sheikhs
During the reign of Mahmud I, the Ottomans systematically destroyed these principalities to establish central state authority, leading to a period of chaos and anarchy in the Kurdish geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. In the latter half of the 19th century, a series of Kurdish religious students of the Baghdad Naqshbandi saint, Mevlana Halid, began establishing their spiritual and temporal sovereignty in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>. Sultan Abdulhamid supported these Naqshbandi lodges to re-establish Ottoman control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. These sheikhs expanded their power, notably by seizing properties from churches and monasteries. A significant number of Armenian villagers even supported this new phenomenon, converting to Islam and paying homage to these sheikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>. This led to a radical [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | demographic and cultural transformation]] in areas like Hizan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.

Sheikh Said was the grandson of Sheikh Ali Sepin, a prominent Naqshbandi leader who had established a sovereign structure in the Hınıs region with Ottoman support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. The new Turkish state's efforts to dismantle their power structures and dismiss them as "people of a bygone era" fueled their rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>.

### The Rebellion and Its Aftermath
The Sheikh Said rebellion (1925) saw a tragic suppression, with tens of thousands killed and villages burned across the Kurdish geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. The new Turkish regime aimed to send a clear message of force. The speaker emphasizes a moral principle: one should never side with the oppressor, especially when discussing a victimized person or a power that destroyed an entire society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>.

There was also a modern Kurdish national movement, distinct from the Naqshbandi sheikhs, centered in Syria and led by figures like the Bedirhan brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>. Despite their historical animosity, there are claims of attempts to unify these two disparate groups during the 1925 rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>.

## American Colleges in Anatolia
American Colleges were established in various locations across Anatolia, predominantly by Protestant missionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:44:00">[52:44:00]</a>. Their primary aim was to convert Armenians to Protestantism, an endeavor where they were quite successful, unlike with the Greeks who resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>. Protestantism was linked to modernity, good education, and rebellion against traditional religious authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>.

These colleges focused on training qualified personnel for modern professions like teaching, medicine, and commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>. Their student and teaching staff were overwhelmingly Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>. During Abdulhamid's reign, Muslim Turks were forbidden from attending these schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:33:00">[54:33:00]</a>. The establishment of these schools was also influenced by a significant migration of Armenians from eastern villages to western and central Anatolian cities like Adana, Kayseri, and Merzifon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:00">[55:02:02]</a>. Merzifon's rise as a cultural center was likely due to its location at the junction of major trade routes connecting Samsun, Istanbul, and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Tarsus
Tarsus holds a rich history, serving as the ancient capital of Cilicia and a crucial port city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a>.
*   **Roman Period:** After the Roman overthrow of the Cilicia Kingdom around 60 BC, Tarsus became the capital of a Roman province. Notable figures like the jurist Cicero served as governor, and Saint Paul, a key founder of Christianity, was a Jew from Tarsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.
*   **Arab Rule:** For 300 years, starting in the late 7th century, Tarsus was an Arab province and remained the regional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>.
*   **Byzantine and Armenian Influence:** Byzantium reclaimed Cilicia in the 11th century. An Armenian governor, Abul Garib, was appointed, and he played a crucial role in settling Armenian feudal lords in Cilicia after the Battle of Malazgirt (1071), laying the foundations for the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:35:00">[58:35:00]</a>. While Tarsus remained the official capital and coronation site (Hagia Sophia church), the actual capital shifted to Kozan for security reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49:00">[59:49:00]</a>.
*   **Mamluk and Ramazanoğlu Rule:** In the 14th century, the Egyptian Mamluks captured Cilicia, making Tarsus their power center and relocating a significant Arab population there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. However, the Mamluks entrusted the administration of the region, increasingly dominated by Turkmen tribes, to a Turkmen named Ramazan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. Ramazan established a separate capital in Adana, an older but previously less important city, leading to Adana quickly surpassing Tarsus as the region's main city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

## [[turkish_political_transformation_and_international_relations | Turkey]]'s Image and Political Culture
### Hatred of Turks in Armenia
The hatred of Turks in Armenia is attributed solely to Turkey's stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. The continuous and blatant denial of historical facts, such as the massacre and exile of a society that shared a 1000-year history, is seen as immoral and the primary reason for this deep-seated resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

### Political Landscape and Freedom (Russia vs. Turkey)
When comparing Russia and Turkey, Russia is described as having a much freer and more relaxed society, both in terms of private life comfort and the freedom of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. In contrast, the "political opposition" in Turkey is viewed as increasingly turning into "unnecessary slop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

### Determinants of Political Views
An individual's political views are primarily shaped by two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>:
1.  **Family Tradition:** The political attitudes and beliefs learned from one's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>.
2.  **Quality of Relationship with Family:** This relationship determines whether an individual continues the inherited political tradition, adopts the opposite view, or seeks a new path by selectively integrating themes from their upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>.

## Sarız Alevis/Turkmens
The Sarız district of Kayseri province is known to have a significant population of Avşar Turkmens who settled there recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>. These Turkmens were relocated by the Ottoman administration to Adana, Tarsus, and Mersin in 1909, where they participated in the Armenian massacre and were subsequently given the opportunity to loot Armenian properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.

## [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | Commercialization of Şirince]]
The village of Şirince has undergone a disappointing commercial transformation, from a place where village women made and sold traditional lace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a> to a hub of "predatory aggression and immorality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. Local villagers, initially selling handmade lace, transitioned to selling cheap, factory-made goods from places like Taiwan, pretending they were handmade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. This evolved into selling various "trinkets," postcards, and soap, driven by wholesalers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. The wine sold is described as "garbage," and the other goods as "terrifying unnecessaryness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.

## Capitalism and Advertising Culture
Capitalism is criticized for turning everything into a commodity and making natural human feelings artificial and plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.
*   **Greed and Domination:** While greed for money is a timeless human trait, modern society, particularly since the mid-19th century, has seen this "Harpagon mentality" become the dominant societal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>. The state's sole or guiding concern has become serving this "stinginess" or "growth," leading to cultural and civilizational collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.
*   **Advertising as Normalized Lying:** Modern society is characterized by the advertising discourse, which has "taken people's minds, souls, and culture captive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>. This is seen as an American phenomenon, where constant, non-stop bombardment of advertisements normalizes lying for profit. This immoral worldview has dominated Western societies, becoming a dogma where lying for profit is considered morally right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. This system is deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>.

## Madrasah Science vs. Modern Science
The comparison between madrasah science (or Scholastic science in Europe) and modern science is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. Both are systems of knowledge that provide answers about the universe, its formation, morality, and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. Scholastic science, particularly in the later Middle Ages, involved sophisticated and rational discussions based on religious foundations (Church in the West, Islam in the East) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

Two fundamental differences are highlighted:
1.  **Institutional Sclerosis:** Old science, relying on written infrastructure like holy books (Bible, Quran, Hadith), suffered from institutional sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. When existing hypotheses became insufficient, it was difficult to overcome fundamental assumptions due to entrenched interpretations and institutional ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>. Modern science, in contrast, bravely rejected existing religious institutional frameworks, a "difference of courage" not seen in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>.
2.  **Validation through Technical Application:** Modern science, since the 17th century, strongly emphasizes testing knowledge through technical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. The accuracy of information is proven by its technological utility, rather than its conformity with sacred texts or established authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. This shift in validation criteria is a key distinction.

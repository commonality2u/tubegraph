The terms "monarchy" and "republic" describe different methods of succession for the head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. For a significant portion of human history, monarchy was perceived as the most accurate method for governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Monarchy
Monarchy is characterized by power being given to a person as a birthright, rather than being determined by intrigues, conflicts, or elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The extent of the monarch's power can vary greatly, from symbolic roles like the kings in England who do not directly interfere in governance, to kings who attempt to rule personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

A known benefit of monarchy for ruling cadres is that it generally allows for a longer term of power, potentially spanning 10, 20, or even 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. The underlying idea is that when power is passed down from father to son within a family, the new ruler will show loyalty to the preferences of the previous one and protect those who gained positions of power during the predecessor's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. However, in reality, sons have historically rebelled against, staged coups against, killed, imprisoned, or harmed their fathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

The view that republican regimes were not sustainable prevailed until the 1920s and 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## Republic
In a republic, the head of state is not chosen through a "genetic lottery" where the son replaces the father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Instead, various ruling factions engage in behind-the-scenes deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, nominating two or three candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. One candidate is then elected president through an "election drama" with an almost always certain outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. The elected president accumulates political debts and obligations towards those who supported their rise to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. To avoid paying off all these debts, the president may remove their supporters one by one, ensuring the "political game wheel" continues to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

Today, republican regimes appear to be "stalling" and in "serious distress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
There is no definitive answer as to which of these two methods of governance is inherently better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Both monarchies and republics have seen success at different times and in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, but more often than not, both have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

A fundamental obstacle in any system of governance, whether monarchy or republic, is the mortality of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Even if a perfect order is established with the right team of governors, these individuals will eventually die, leading to the challenge of finding new replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

Discussions on various Turkish cities reveal their deep historical layers and transformative periods.

## Merzifon: A Crossroads of Development
Merzifon's rise as a cultural and attractive center is largely attributed to its strategic location and later economic developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. It is speculated that Merzifon was not particularly significant in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. Its growth in the 19th century was spurred by the development of the Samsun port and the increased traffic on the highway connecting Samsun, Istanbul, and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

### The American College of Merzifon
Many American colleges were established across [[historical_and_social_overview_of_turkey_and_its_evolution | Anatolia]] by Protestant missionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. Notable examples include institutions in Harput and Antep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. The primary goal of these colleges was not to educate Turks or Muslims, but rather to convert [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]] to Protestantism; efforts with Greeks were less successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. For [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]], Protestantism was seen as a path to modernity, good education, and professional training, challenging traditional priestly structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

These schools aimed to train qualified personnel such as teachers, doctors, and merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Their student and, later, teaching staff were overwhelmingly [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. During the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid, Muslim Turks were forbidden from attending these schools, though a few were accepted after 1908 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. The 19th century saw a significant migration of [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]] from [[historical_settlement_structures_in_eastern_anatolia | eastern villages]] to western cities like Adana, Kayseri, Merzifon, Gürün, and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. These schools were established in areas where [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]] had densely settled, shifting from agricultural work to urban trades and modern professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

## Tarsus: A Legacy of Shifting Powers
Tarsus holds a rich history, serving as the capital of Çukurova and its main port in ancient and medieval times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. Today, Tarsus is inland due to alluvial deposits from rivers like the Seyhan or Ceyhan, which filled its original port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.

### Roman and Early Christian Eras
Around 60 BC, the Romans established a province in the region after overthrowing the old [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]] Kingdom, with Tarsus as its capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. The famous Roman jurist Cicero even served as governor in Tarsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. Importantly, Saint Paul, considered the true founder of Christianity, was a Jew from Tarsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

### Arab and Byzantine Rule
By the late 7th century (around 650 or 660), Tarsus fell under Arab rule for 300 years, becoming an Arab province and regional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. Later, in the 10th century, the Byzantines recaptured [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]], reorganizing it as a Byzantine province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

### Armenian Kingdom and Mamluk Influence
In the 11th century, an [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] governor named Abul Garib, from the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] Royal lineage, was appointed to Tarsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. Following the Battle of Malazgirt, many [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenians]] migrated from the east, and Abul Garib played a key role in settling [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] feudal lords in [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]] around 1068-1073, laying the foundation for the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] sovereignty period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

When the [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | Armenian]] Kingdom of [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]] was established, Tarsus served as the official capital, with coronation ceremonies held in the Hagia Sophia church there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. However, for security reasons, the kings preferred to reside in Kozan, which became the *actual* capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. The Hagia Sophia cathedral was later demolished, and the Tarsus Ulu Mosque was built in its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.

In the mid-14th century (1350s), the Egyptian Mamluks captured all of [[cultural_and_architectural_traditions_in_trkiye_and_surrounding_regions | Cilicia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Tarsus again became a Mamluk capital, serving as a garrison center, and a significant Arab population from Egypt was relocated there to support Mamluk power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. However, the region's administration was largely dominated by Turkmen tribes. The Mamluks handed over regional governance to a Turkmen leader named Ramazan, leading to the emergence of the Ramazanoğlu Principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. As the Mamluk central authority was in Tarsus, Ramazan chose Adana, a previously less important city, as his separate capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. This decision quickly elevated Adana to become the main city and capital of the region, surpassing Tarsus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

These city histories illustrate the dynamic nature of power, trade, and cultural shifts across [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | Turkish]] and regional identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

The speaker is currently undertaking a [[translation_project_of_an_unfinished_encyclopedia | translation project]] of an unfinished geography dictionary, a task he has been deeply engaged with for four months, working from morning until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This dedication involves a strict routine of quick breakfast and then straight to the table, only rising occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The family eats one meal a day, and other than that, he remains at his desk until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Geography Dictionary

The specific work being translated is a geography dictionary published by Sukiyasi in 1902 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The speaker has frequently mentioned this dictionary over the past 10-12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He first discovered it around 2009-2010 while working on place names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Unfinished Nature

Like many famous encyclopedias in Turkey, such as the Istanbul encyclopedia (name not recalled by speaker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, this geography dictionary is an unfinished work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It remained incomplete for various reasons, with only two volumes, totaling over 1300 pages, ever published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Significance and Content

The dictionary is described as a very interesting Armenian dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It uniquely describes geography as a "Land of symbols and meanings," illustrating how the same physical geography can be presented as a completely different place through another culture and narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The book focuses on Eastern Turkey, highlighting Armenian perspectives and history with Armenian terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The speaker considers it an extraordinarily useful book for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>:
*   **Microhistory**: It provides unparalleled detailed information on the microhistory of the region, covering every village, town, fountain, hill, and ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Unique Information**: Approximately seventy percent of the information contained in the dictionary is not available in Turkish sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Ottoman History and Armenian Crisis**: It is an exceptional resource for understanding Ottoman history, particularly the Armenian crisis, by presenting real struggles of real people without reducing them to clich√©s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Entertaining Read**: The author, a priest who is not an intellectual but full of superstitions, includes many fun stories and tales about villages and their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Historical Accumulation**: It draws from a rich collection of old Armenian historical sources and chronicles, detailing events from the 4th to the 19th centuries in a mixed and engaging way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Pre-1915 Context**: Written 15 years before the 1915 incident, it reveals a painful and terrible process that unfolded before that event, offering a perspective where the 1915 incident is merely a "footnote" or "final act" of a longer historical tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. It highlights that Armenian history is not solely defined by the 1915 events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### The Speaker's Translation Process

The speaker recognizes that the Turkish reader might find many references, names, ceremonies, and customs in the book obscure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. To address this, he is writing comments and explanations for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. He also plans to complete some of the missing parts of the original work by utilizing the author's sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, expecting to add 100-150 new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Additionally, for each item, he includes information about the current status of the place, its changing names, explanations of references, and source checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

While the original is 1300 pages, the speaker has cut parts not directly related to Turkey, such as items concerning Armenia, Iran, and Russia, reducing the core text to 800-something pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, with his additions, the translated work is expected to again reach 1200-1300 pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Around eighty percent of the main translation is complete, with the full translation expected to be finished in about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Additions, corrections, and forewords will likely take until the beginning of summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

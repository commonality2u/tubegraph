From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The persistent question of why women have not achieved prominence in various fields is explored, considering whether it is due to a lack of rights or other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Historical and Cultural Absence in Arts and Politics

Historically, and across diverse cultures, there has been a notable scarcity of women in fields such as arts, visual arts, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This observation spans `[[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | ancient times]]`, the `[[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | Middle Ages]]`, `[[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | modern Europe]]`, Aegean and American native cultures, and `[[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | Islamic culture]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While there are some "good writers" among women, their numbers are few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Similarly, in politics, there are very few `[[the_role_of_women_in_turkish_politics | Turkish women]]` who can be classified as geniuses in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The general pattern observed is that, even when opportunities are provided, exceptional female talent does not emerge as a rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Debunking Oppression as the Sole Explanation

The idea that this disparity is solely explained by `[[power_dynamics_and_elite_control in western societies | oppression]]` and male domination is dismissed as incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Biological Differences and Human Psychology

A more critical understanding involves human psychology and the `[[biological_differences_between_men_and_women | biological differences between men and women]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Men and women possess different biological functions, meaning their genetic structures vary, leading to distinct psychological advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### The Primary Biological Function of Women

The fundamental `[[biological_differences_between_men_and_women | biological function]]` of women is to give birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. After birth, a woman's primary duty is to ensure the safety, care, and feeding of the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This includes ensuring the child does not die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Compensatory Drives in Men

Conversely, men have historically attempted to compensate for their `[[biological_differences_between_men_and_women | biological dysfunctions]]` or weaknesses in the biological field by developing skills and ambitions in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This perspective views human beings as not significantly different from other mammals like monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The functions of men and women in mammals are obvious and logical, reflecting `[[evolutionary_psychology_and_its_influence_on_gender_dynamics | biological evolution]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Modern Society and Equality

In contemporary society, where `[[impact_of_societal_roles_on_womens_achievements | human functions]]` have become complex and "unnatural," discussions around granting women certain rights and degrees of equality are considered valid and necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, the underlying principle remains that humans are animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### The Animalistic Core of Humanity

Just as a gorilla differs from a chimpanzee or an orangutan, humans have added "decorations" such as science, art, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These societal structures and achievements are likened to a peacock's decorated tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. At its core, a human being is an animal whose primary functions are sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In these fundamental functions, the capabilities of women and men differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Truth vs. Ideology

It is asserted that these are facts, contrasting with an age where ideological lies are often more respected than objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

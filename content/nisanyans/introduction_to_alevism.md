Alevism, as it is understood today, crystallized in the late 15th and early 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The Alevi society was historically a very closed community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[historical_development_of_alevism | Historical Development of Alevism]]

The movement originated in Ardabil, Iran, with the Safavid dynasty, led consecutively by Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and Shah Ismail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This marked the beginning of a significant revolutionary movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> and a religious reform movement against classical Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The movement grew to a point that threatened the existence of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, particularly during the reigns of Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Beyazıt II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It was ultimately suppressed by Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

While the Shah Ismail movement sparked a new incident using some themes of poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, the roots of Alevism go back further, with earlier rebellions in Anatolia in the 1200s, such as those led by Father Ishak and Father Ilyas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Remnants of movements like Hurufism and Batinism also continued in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A significant number of new and often forced converts to Islam in Anatolia experienced unrest, contributing to a rebellion movement that unified various resistance centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

The Ottoman state perceived Alevism as a deadly ideological danger and ruthlessly suppressed it for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This suppression included crushing, exiling to mountains, and killing those declared illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The state continuously used oppressive tools to destroy Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Persecution continued into the 19th century, particularly during the suppression of the Janissary Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Alevis often lived illegally, fleeing to remote areas to hide their identity and worship secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Core Beliefs and Practices

The main theme of Alevism is a resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law, and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. The movement is based on rejecting many basic Islamic conditions, such as fasting (or practicing it differently), Sharia rules, pilgrimage, and zakat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:14">[01:54:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>. Despite this, Alevis define themselves as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>.

Alevis believe that the first four Caliphs, except Ali, were illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. They accept Ali as the true Caliph of Muhammad, followed by the 12 Imams from his lineage, who they believe were the real representatives of Islam until the 800s AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:18">[02:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:24">[02:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>.

Alevism in Turkey differs from Iranian Shiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:42">[02:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>. Unlike Iranian Shiism, which has a strong madrasah tradition, academic framework, and mullah hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:55">[02:16:55]</a>, Turkish Alevism lacked such opportunities and central organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. Instead, it relies on dedes who continue a local shaman and rahit tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.

## [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community | Cultural and Ethnic Diversity within the Alevi Community]]

Alevism is an eclectic movement, drawing from diverse influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>. While some Turkish and Turkmen tribes in Anatolia who resisted full Islamization joined the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:28">[02:12:28]</a>, a significant portion of Alevis are Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>. Approximately half of the Alevi population in Turkey considers themselves Turkish, and half are of Kurdish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:44">[02:48:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

*   **Kurdish Alevis:** A substantial Kurdish population, especially west of the Euphrates in regions like Malatya, Sivas, Tunceli, and Erzincan, has adopted the Alevi religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:55">[02:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>. East of the Euphrates, Alevis were largely cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:17">[02:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:44">[02:12:44]</a>. Kurdish Alevis have historically carried various local traditions and heterodox beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>.
*   **Arab Alevis (Nusayris):** In Antakya and Hatay, there is an Arab Alevi population, also known as Nusayris, who follow a completely different tradition with distinct temples, worship forms, and beliefs, similar to Syrian Alevis on the Mediterranean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10">[02:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:18">[02:13:18]</a>. They have closer ties to Arab Christians in terms of lifestyle and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:06">[02:38:06]</a>.
*   **Tahtacı:** Located in the Aegean and Mediterranean mountains, especially in pine forest regions from Antalya to Çanakkale, Tahtacıs are forest villagers who historically had little harmony with the state and lived nomadically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:35">[02:38:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>. They have a distinct, primitive culture and are not related to leftism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:47">[02:39:47]</a>. Some Tahtacıs vote for the MHP and may not consider themselves related to Islam at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:57">[02:39:57]</a>.
*   **Abdals:** Found in Central and Southern Anatolia, particularly Gaziantep, Abdals are considered Alevis but have a separate culture and tradition, often involved in music and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a>. They are sometimes associated with Romani communities by Anatolian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:33">[02:40:33]</a>. Famous Abdals include folk singer Neset Ertaş <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:46">[02:40:46]</a>. They also hold a healthy perspective against state authority and do not take Muslims seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:03">[02:41:03]</a>.
*   **Alevis in the Balkans:** Alevi populations also exist in Albania and Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Southern Albania has an intense Bektashi presence, where almost all the Muslim population is affiliated with Bektashism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. In the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria, a serious radical state hostility tradition exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:23">[02:52:23]</a>.

## [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis' Connection to Kemalism in Turkey]]

Alevis largely vote for the CHP (Republican People's Party) today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a> because their long-term enemy has been the Sunni Islam side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:39">[02:35:39]</a>. For Alevis, secularism and Atatürk are symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:48">[02:47:48]</a>. The Kemalist state offered them recognition and opportunities for the first time, allowing them to be civil servants, police officers, or generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>. They view Kemalism as the only means to assert their share in the state and challenge Sunni Islamist dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02">[03:03:02]</a>.

### Political Alignments and Shifts

In the 1960s, Alevis attempted to engage in politics within the Justice Party, a moderate right-wing, liberal, and pro-American party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. However, feeling cheated by Süleyman Demirel, they founded their own party, the Turkish Unity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:41">[03:33:41]</a>. This party, initially strong in Sivas, quickly moved to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:51">[03:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:04">[03:56:04]</a>.

By the 1970s, Alevis largely shifted to the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>. The revolutionary youth leadership of the 1970s was predominantly from the Alevi community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:20">[03:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:52">[03:49:52]</a>. The Alevi culture significantly influenced the leftist culture in Turkey, leading to the bağlama and Alevi breath becoming symbols of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:41">[03:38:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:43">[03:44:43]</a>. A key characteristic of the Turkish left, shaped by Alevi influence, is its anti-Muslim stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>.

## [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | Cultural and Religious Dynamics within Alevi Communities]]

Alevism is characterized by its opposition to Islam as defined by the Ottoman state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. It has incorporated various elements, including potential influences from Shamanist Turks from Central Asia, although this is not considered a primary factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

Alevism also exhibits clear influences from Christianity in its Ali mythology, where Ali is a figure similar to Jesus, and his 12 followers resemble the 12 apostles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:15">[02:05:15]</a>. Alevi traditions and ceremonies strongly resemble symbols of Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:19">[02:05:19]</a>. Additionally, Alevism has drawn from old Kurdish traditions and anti-Islamic Middle Eastern ceremonies, some with Christian themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:38">[02:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:40">[02:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:45">[02:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:48">[02:05:48]</a>.

### Geographical Distribution

The historically dominant Alevi region forms a clear triangle, encompassing Sivas (especially Divriği, Kangal districts), Tunceli, Erzincan, parts of Tokat, Amasya, and narrowing towards Maraş in the metropolitan area of Malatya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:16">[02:20:16]</a>. This area largely overlaps with regions where religious separatist movements rebelled against the Byzantine Orthodox Church for almost a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:41">[02:18:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>. Divriği, for example, was a center of the Paulician rebellion and remains a key center of Alevi culture today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:42">[02:20:42]</a>.

Other notable Alevi regions include:
*   Coastal Syria, including Antakya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:56">[02:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   Southern Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>.
*   The Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:14">[02:08:14]</a>.

These four distinct regions share the common feature of being under Ottoman rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:16">[02:08:16]</a>. Alevism is not specifically an Eastern Anatolian phenomenon but is concentrated west of Eastern Anatolia and east of Central Anatolia, specifically on the west bank of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:34">[02:16:34]</a>. Regions like Van, Hakkari, Siirt, and Mardin have virtually no Alevi population due to historical cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>. Some Alevis in Urfa and Diyarbakir are Turkmen Alevis who migrated there later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:29">[02:17:29]</a>.

## [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye | Alevis and Modern Turkish Politics]]

Alevis have often been at odds with the state for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. The core definition of their identity is shaped by opposition to Sunni Islam ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:43">[02:38:43]</a>. When the Republic of Turkey was established with a secular framework under Atatürk, it provided a unique opportunity for Alevis to find a place within the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a>. This shift offered them a chance to assert their rights and participate in state institutions, contrasting with the previous Ottoman emphasis on Sunni Islamic ideology that marginalized them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>.

Despite the appeal of Kemalism, the speaker notes that it is a "dead end" for Alevis because Kemalist thought is a political ideology doomed to be a minority in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:41">[03:38:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. In a democratic context, the majority's ideology is often rooted in Islam, leaving Kemalists marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:43">[03:43:43]</a>.

## Personal Observations

Visiting Alevi villages or regions like Tunceli (Dersim) evokes a sense of relief and optimism, encountering intelligent, well-mannered people who have largely protected themselves from state ideological aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:31">[04:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:52">[04:19:52]</a>. However, discussions often veer into staunch support for Atatürk, which can become tiresome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:25">[04:22:25]</a>. Many modern Alevis, while not actively practicing Alevism, carry a foundation from their family upbringing that fosters skepticism towards official lies and state aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:15">[04:31:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:55">[04:39:55]</a>. This resilience stems from a long history of resisting forced assimilation by the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:11">[04:41:11]</a>.

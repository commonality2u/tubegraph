The [[historical_perspectives_on_kurds_and_turks_in_anatolia | origin of the Karaman dynasty]] is a subject of historical debate, particularly concerning the ethnic background of its founder, Nure Sufi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>.

## The Armenian Origin Theory

Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, who wrote the standard history of the Ottoman Empire in Western languages, stated, based on an Ottoman historian, that Nure Sufi, the founder of the Karaman dynasty, had [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian origins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:39">[03:15:39]</a>. This information is also found in the *History of Ebü Fida*, considered an older and reliable source on medieval Islamic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:19">[03:52:19]</a>. Some [[turkish_historical_events | Ottoman historiography]] also repeated this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:37">[03:57:37]</a>.

Mustafa Ali, a notable Ottoman historian writing around 1600, also mentioned this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:44">[05:05:44]</a>. According to Ebü Fida, Nure Sufi was originally an Armenian who became a Muslim and joined a Sufi order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:10">[05:39:10]</a>. Due to his asceticism, honesty, and piety, people paid allegiance to him, and his son, Karaman, subsequently became a regional power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:15">[05:59:15]</a>.

## Challenging the Armenian Origin Theory

Despite some historical accounts, the notion of Armenian origins for the Karamanids has been a subject of continuous discussion for 700 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:17">[04:49:17]</a>. The speaker suggests this theory likely stems from a misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:53">[04:54:53]</a>.

A crucial piece of evidence against the Armenian origin theory comes from İbn Bibi, who wrote a Seljuk history around 1282, approximately 202 years after the Karamanids appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:08">[06:43:08]</a>. As a person from the ruling class at the time, he would have been well-informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:12">[07:12:12]</a>. İbn Bibi never mentions an Armenian origin for Nure Sufi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:48">[07:14:48]</a>. Instead, his work (originally Persian, but translated) describes Karaman (Nure Sufi's son) as a "Turkmen coal miner living in the Armenian and surrounding districts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:28">[07:24:28]</a>.

The speaker posits that the word "Armen" (Armenian) used by İbn Bibi was misinterpreted by later historians like Ebü Fida and Hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:05">[09:07:05]</a>. The locality referred to is Ermenek, which has no connection to Armenian ethnicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:29">[08:01:29]</a>. The name Ermenek derives from the ancient Roman town of Germanika (or Germanicopolis), named after the Roman commander Germanicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:35">[08:12:35]</a>. Therefore, the confusion likely arose from a geographical place name being mistaken for an ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:20">[09:36:20]</a>.

Ultimately, there is zero information from Nure Sufi's contemporaries or even his son regarding his roots or origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:04">[09:42:04]</a>. The Karamanids only began mentioning Nure Sufi as their grandfather after they became a Beylik dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:18">[10:02:18]</a>.

## Critique of Turkish Historiography

The speaker criticizes modern Turkish historical accounts, such as the Turkish Wikipedia article on Nure Sufi, for creating a "whole mythology" of his origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. This mythology, which describes his journey from Central Asia to the Caucasus, then to Eastern [[turkish_historical_events | Türkiye]], and finally to Karaman, is deemed a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:07">[10:31:07]</a>. The speaker asserts that [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | national Turkish historiography]] is "completely empty from A to Z," describing it as "a lie and a history of telling mythology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:17">[10:46:17]</a>.

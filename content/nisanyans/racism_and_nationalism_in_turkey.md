## Overview of Turkish Nationalism and its Criticisms

The speaker identifies a specific "pathology" of nationalism in Türkiye, describing it as a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. This contrasts with global nationalism, which is often seen as a tool of populism that glorifies the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. The speaker argues that this form of [[role_of_nationalism_in_modern_trkiye | nationalism]] is the "present-day representative of the arrogance of the nation," which is seen as a "deepest and most malignant dimension of historical Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:54">[01:41:54]</a>.

The fundamental theory of this society is summarized as "We conquered, therefore, we are right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. This perspective, according to the speaker, prevents understanding or emotional connection with neighboring peoples and subjects of Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>. It also leads to an "ignorance bordering on stupidity on the Kurdish issue," Türkiye's most important contemporary issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.

## Kemalism as a Form of Racism and State Worship

The speaker labels "Kemalism" as a "disease" that, if not overcome, prevents the cause of civilization in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:29">[01:43:29]</a>. They assert that "contemporary Turkish racism and state worship" are symbolized by the icon of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>. This icon is seen as a "flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a> and a "symbol of a moral blindness that a priori justifies all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a>.

Those who carry this icon, specifically the "semi-educated and cheap modernity-polished classes of Türkiye," spew hatred and complexes against the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>. Domestically, they have lost the opportunity to establish emotional communication with common strata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a> and are forced to marginalize themselves politically and embrace state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>. The "Kemalist sect" rejects Islam verbally but represents the deepest, most malignant dimension of historical Islam's arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with "Lynching Campaigns" in Türkiye

The speaker has frequently been the target of "lynching campaigns" on a national scale in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, attributing this to being "born in the wrong country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These campaigns often stem from perceived insults against national symbols or sensitivities.

Examples of such campaigns include:
*   **2000: Black Sea travel guide:** A "stone and crush" enthusiasm became public due to sentences in a Black Sea travel guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Specific contentious points were:
    *   Describing Bayburt as a place where "all the women and girls run away as if possessed by a demon" when foreigners enter, similar to Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The women wear "ihram" (a beige, potato-colored cover) and run away, making it seem like "Afghanistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The speaker clarified this was a simile and a correct observation, having a dream to visit Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
    *   Mentioning Topal Osman, described as someone like Abdullah Çatlı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The speaker stated he knew how much love and admiration Topal Osman's close friends had for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Referring to the presence of "Natashas" (women from former Soviet republics, often associated with prostitution) in Trabzon and Rize, noting that hotels were full of them and it had become a main sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The speaker wrote that these "Natashas filling the lobby were completely harmless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The speaker noted having "nothing against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>, and described a personal encounter in a hotel where "professional ladies" were sitting in low-cut clothes, cracking sunflower seeds, and drinking tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. He wrote that these hotels are "brothels" but "it doesn't harm anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.
*   **Post-2000: Şirince constructions:** Exposure to a hate campaign due to constructions in Şirince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **2009 & 2012: Freedom of speech regarding Allah and the Prophet Muhammad:** Lynched for asking about the limits of freedom of speech regarding Allah and the prophet in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and again in 2012 for statements regarding the historical personality of Prophet Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The speaker states he has "never insulted Allah or the prophet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.
*   **Sexual intimacy between psychologist and client:** A "wild lynching campaign" occurred when the speaker questioned the moral defensibility of the consequences of lynching a psychologist for sexual intimacy with a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Elazığ earthquake:** Lynched for questioning the sentiment of praying for people to die in Elazığ, then feeling bad when they do, specifically asking about a city whose population is "190% or so fascist and bigoted fascists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The speaker stated he didn't care about the men but focused on saving innocent children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.
*   **Atatürk's adopted daughters:** A recent incident involving questions about Atatürk's relationship with his adopted "spiritual" daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. The speaker stated that the rumor of a mistress relationship is "gossip known by everyone throughout Atatürk's entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a> and "not something I invented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. The core question posed was whether it was "right for an adult man [Atatürk] to adopt a girl and keep them in his private apartment, that is, in his own suite where the doors of the nightgown are closed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. The speaker believes the "event itself is wrong" even if he "didn't even touch his finger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that these campaigns become boring over time, as they involve "keyboard warriors" who send threats but "will do none of these" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.

## Atatürk's Character and Political Actions

The speaker discusses Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's personality, drawing parallels from a Nazım Hikmet poem, describing him as a "person with an extraordinarily strong personality and who reduced everyone around him to nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>. Atatürk is characterized as someone who "trusted no one but his soul" and "betrayed everyone who was close to him, everyone without exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:15">[03:21:15]</a>. This included close friends and political allies such as Fethi Okyar, Rauf Orbay, Kazım Karabekir, and İsmet İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:30">[03:23:30]</a>.

Atatürk is also called a "victorious and magnificent Gambler" who "gambled wildly throughout his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:06">[03:40:06]</a>, taking "crazy risks" at every point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>. He is further described as "sarcastic, belligerent, cunning and dominating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:57">[03:43:57]</a>.

Regarding Atatürk's adopted son, Abdurrahim, the speaker notes that this topic was a "big taboo" until 10-15 years ago, but was later brought into play as a "defense mechanism" against criticisms regarding the adopted daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>. Abdurrahim was an orphaned child Atatürk took with him in Van in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. He was with Atatürk in his personal service, even in Damascus and Çankaya mansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, he was sent away to İzmir just before Atatürk married Latife Hanım in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:13">[02:41:13]</a>, only to return after the divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:37">[02:47:37]</a>. The speaker questions why he was sent away when Atatürk got married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>.

The speaker argues that in 1922, any leader in Atatürk's position, facing a ruined state and needing to protect their own power, would logically rebuild the state from scratch while protecting their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:57">[03:29:57]</a>. This would involve creating "national excitement," even if fake, in a collapsed economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:17">[03:37:17]</a>, and painting the eyes of ordinary citizens with stories of "homeland, nation, Sakarya and infidels pouring into the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It would also necessitate deterring the Kurds to prevent state disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:22">[03:41:22]</a>.

## The Kurdish Issue and Turkish Racism

The speaker notes that [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey_and_armenia | Turkish racism]] has an "immoral" but "rational" policy against the Kurds, attempting to assimilate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>. However, this assimilation project has "failed," marking a "terrible defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:50">[03:33:50]</a>. The turning point is placed around the 1960s, when Kurds started attending university, leading to the collapse of this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:17">[03:34:17]</a>. The speaker sees the "Turks were defeated in this regard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:02">[03:35:02]</a>, and predicts that the Kurdish side's victory will involve integrating into the system and taking it over from the inside, continuing a nationalism similar to the Turks to reach a new balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:57">[03:35:57]</a>.

## Ottoman Perceptions of Western Morality and Women's Rights

During the Tanzimat Period, the educated classes of the Ottoman Empire, particularly those aware of France, "unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. This acceptance included observations that Westerners took fewer bribes, lied less, were well-read, educated their children, respected their women, had clean cities, and were advanced in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. [[impact_of_european_political_changes_on_turkish_identity_discourse | Women's rights]] were among the most important issues; Ottoman intellectuals believed that a nation with ignorant women would suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

Notable developments in women's education include:
*   The establishment of a Girls' Teachers' School (Darül muallimat) in the Ottoman Empire in 1880, the same year as the first state girls' high school in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. This school applied a "completely Western-style curriculum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   Later, a separate girls' Darülfünun (university) was established, and eventually, female students were accepted into all faculties of Darülfünun before the Republic in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.
*   Women's magazines were published since the 1880s and 1890s, with a common theme of women's education and its role in becoming a modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

The concept of class-based relations, however, was very weak in Ottoman culture until the 20th century, unlike in the West where it became widespread after the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. Ideas about the rights of the proletarian class, the poor, and peasants started being heard in Türkiye after the Soviet Revolution in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Power and Human Psychology

The speaker suggests that the desire for social power and sexual power often "go hand in hand" in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Unlimited power, where "no one can say nice to you" or dare to confront you, leads men to "push the limits" and "go a step further every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Historically, men who gain great power often desire a "harem," seeking to engage with many women, and sometimes men, including underage individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. This behavior is limited by social conventions, laws, and neighborhood pressure for most people, but when these brakes are removed, there are "no brakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. An exception to this pattern, as noted by the speaker, is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who, despite being at the top of power for 21 years, has not been associated with such mischief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

## Challenges in Government Change

The speaker notes a contemporary trend where it has become increasingly difficult to change governments through elections, suggesting that election technology and management methods have become so advanced that the process seems to have reached a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Regarding [[political_changes_in_turkey | Turkish political developments and changes in government]], the speaker expresses a feeling of nausea when thinking about the elections in Türkiye, especially after Kılıçdaroğlu's recent statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The speaker questions whether Kılıçdaroğlu's rhetoric was due to political pragmatism or something worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Political pragmatism, according to the speaker, involves easily adopting the lowest discourse for "petty calculations of the moment," even if one doesn't truly believe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It's suggested that it's impossible to know if a politician's seemingly "bad" actions stem from genuine belief or situational necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Hypothetical Presidential Reforms for Radical Change

When asked what actions a radical president would take, the speaker outlines several initial steps for a leader promising significant regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>:

1.  **General Amnesty:** A serious regime change should begin with a general amnesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This amnesty should specifically exclude crimes against women and property (e.g., murder, theft, rape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. However, crimes against the state, its ideology, or the public interest (as defined by the political power) should be pardoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Political crimes and crimes of thought are prioritized for amnesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Such a law should be enacted unconditionally within hours of coming to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.
2.  **Establishing a Direct Intelligence Organization:** To ensure orders are obeyed and to gather information about the country's "upper floors," a president needs an intelligence organization directly affiliated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. Existing state institutions are deemed unsuitable for this purpose as they are designed to protect the existing power balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. This new organization would collect useful individuals from existing ones and liquidate the rest to prevent sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
3.  **Creating a Special Treasury/Budget:** Real power requires money that can be used freely for projects, employment, and directing civil and military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. The public budget, being controlled by bureaucracy and subject to accountability from courts, is not suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Therefore, a "Special and Special budget" outside the public budget is essential for revolutionary leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. This can be achieved through methods like high taxes with reduced rates or commissions on major projects (e.g., a nuclear power plant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.
4.  **Using Terror and Example-Setting:** Citing Niccolò Machiavelli, the speaker states that a head of state "should be feared, not loved" to ensure obedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. A brave and radical head of state needs to "click some important people who are in sight for the purpose of making an example and terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>, even killing them, to demonstrate seriousness and ensure compliance with orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

### The Inevitable Downfall of Revolutionary Regimes

The speaker asserts that the process described above—followed by historical figures from Hitler to Atatürk—is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>. The "inevitable logic of power" dictates that leaders who undertake objectively necessary actions for great things eventually cause the system to get stuck and wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>. The initial big steps give way to a system that "scabs over," forming new power balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This leads to a "spiral of tyranny," where the revolutionary power becomes increasingly harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

Key points on the decline:
*   The intelligence organization established for revolutionary programs becomes an uncontrolled oppression force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
*   Parallel state structures and budgets descend into a "swamp of corruption," turning the country into an "economic gangster chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.
*   The intimidation tactic of arrests and killings loses its effect over time, requiring escalation to maintain credibility, thus necessitating "more terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.

For these reasons, "every revolutionary turns into a dictator," and "every dictator eventually has to retire after completing his useful life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. These conclusions are presented as inevitable for anyone studying centuries of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.

## Evolution of Freedom and Modern Revolutions

The speaker critiques common definitions of moral and political freedom, arguing that true individual freedom in forming judgments or influencing political power is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>. However, the Western world did make significant claims and strides in freedom over the last 250 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.

This "modern age" concept of freedom emerged from three key "revolutions":

1.  **The French Revolution (late 18th century):** Marked the independence of individuals from the coercive dominance of religion, particularly the Church's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. After 200 years of religious civil war in Europe, it was realized that religion could not be defeated, leading to the acceptance that individuals could free themselves from religious obligations without blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. This unprecedented revolution fostered significant developments in science, knowledge, and political ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:54">[01:33:54]</a>.
2.  **Post-WWI Urbanization (early 20th century):** Driven by massive rural-to-urban migration, especially to gigantic cities like London, Paris, and New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>. People gained "the freedom to be anonymous," escaping local identity, responsibilities, and moral restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>. This led to radical changes in clothing (e.g., women's provocative attire), normalization of extramarital affairs, and the rise of "shocking" art movements like Cubism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:19">[01:37:19]</a>.
3.  **The 1968 Revolution (mid-20th century):** Enabled by the rapid increase in university populations and the development of birth control methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>. This revolution brought tremendous freedom in sexual morality, allowing individuals to engage in sexual acts with reduced risk of life-altering consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:23">[01:39:23]</a>.

These three stages represent "very important steps taken in the field of moral and political freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>, making Western societies a "pole of freedom" globally from the 1750s until the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>.

However, the speaker questions the sustainability of this "freedom climb" and whether the current point has produced good results for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>. The speaker suggests that the West's 250 years of freedom might be leading to a "bankruptcy point" or "collapse point," indicating a need to re-establish certain things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>.

## Historical Context of Freedom and Reforms

The speaker also discusses an older concept of freedom in the Western world, theorized since the Middle Ages, centered on the relative freedom of powerful political figures (lords, kingdoms) from the King's absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:03">[01:46:03]</a>. This meant "mutual respect for mutual boundaries" between the ruler and powerful elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:45">[01:46:45]</a>. Another dimension was the independence of the religious authority (the Church) from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>. This fragmented political structure in Europe fostered resistance against rulers who tried to centralize power and taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>.

This European model contrasted with the Ottoman Empire, where ruling classes were civil servants whose future depended on the Sultan's whim, allowing him to dismiss them and seize their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:55">[01:48:55]</a>.

The speaker notes that the "Bright Age of the Islamic World" before the Ottomans (e.g., Seljuks) was structurally similar to European feudalism, with power shared among many layers and armed feudal lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. In terms of religious freedom against the ruler, the Islamic world might even have had an advantage with a theoretically defined area of freedom that no religious ruler would violate, and a largely independent clergy class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:38">[01:51:38]</a>. The "military type" regime is characterized as a new style of government emerging in Eastern and Islamic countries after the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>.

### Ottoman vs. Russian Reforms

A key question posed is why Atatürk or Mahmud II could not achieve reforms as permanent and transcendent as those in Russia under Peter the Great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire were similar in size, state structure, ideological problems, and development levels at the beginning of the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

*   **Russia's Success:** Russia made a significant leap in reforms and transformed into a major modern power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. Crucially, the "engine of change" and the "main mass of change" were carried by the Russians themselves, the politically sovereign group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. New types of artists, scientists, military commanders, and businessmen came from ethnic Russians or those who adopted a Russian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Empire's Struggle:** In the Ottoman Empire, the leadership of change and modernization was taken by Christian elements (Greeks, Armenians, Christian Arabs) who were distinct from the state's dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. While these Christian groups achieved a similar level of modernity to Russia in terms of Western-style education, companies, and large-scale businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>, they lacked political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. This led to growing distrust and conflict, eventually turning into "mutual massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. The groups driving modernization became enemies of the state, making it impossible to achieve Russian-style reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

## Contemporary [[political_shifts_and_changes_in_global_power_dynamics | Global Power Dynamics]]

The speaker discusses the potential for open war due to several factors:

*   **NATO's Crisis:** The "great defeat in Ukraine" is seen as a disaster for NATO and the European Union, threatening their credibility and potentially leading to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The speaker highlights the destruction of the Patriot missile system by Russian missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a> and the victory of the private military company Wagner over NATO-aligned forces in Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>.
*   **Western Financial Crisis:** Western banks and state treasuries are described as facing bankruptcy due to uncontrollable borrowing over the past 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. The speaker suggests that the only way out of this unsustainable debt, especially with rising interest rates, is a "great war environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. This war would provide an excuse to "inform" (write off) public debt and promise repayment from looted resources of Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **NATO's Strategic Overextension:** Despite the need for war, the speaker states that NATO has "no possibility of winning a war in the current situation of NATO's front lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. This is attributed to a strategic mistake: overextension from main bases, making logistics a "nightmare" for countries like the Baltic states, Poland, Moldova, and Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. Russia and China, in contrast, have short distances from their production bases to battlefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. The speaker believes the West has no chance in such a war and is at the "end of the Western world as we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

### Defining Democracy in Modern Politics

The speaker critically examines the contemporary use of the term "democracy." It's argued that "democracy" in modern propaganda discourse often refers to places or countries that the West likes or considers allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. Regimes with strong societal support and improved living conditions (e.g., Hungary, China, Russia) are labeled as "not democracy" or even "massacres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Conversely, systems where "a handful of degenerate oligarchs" govern (e.g., Ukraine) are called "democracy" because they are supported by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.

### Modernization of Islamic Societies

The speaker analyzes different approaches to the modernization and secularization of Islamic societies, contrasting figures like Ali Babacan with Prince Salman or Kemal-style strict regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. Prince Salman is presented as a "moderate" figure despite alleged violent actions, showcasing a disconnect in how information is perceived in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Ali Babacan represents a type of figure historically supported by Western financial and intelligence circles to implement minor reforms within their allowed framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

The speaker highlights a "great revolution" taking place in the Arab world, exemplified by Saudi Arabia's audacious architectural projects (e.g., "new Kaaba," "NEM" desert city) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. These projects, even if not fully realized, signify a claim to be the "pioneers of modernity" and "leading power of the new age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. This new approach involves:
*   Radical severance of relations with traditional patrons (England, America) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.
*   Agreements with Iran and readmission of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.
*   Shifting away from dollar trade and refusing to participate in sanctions against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.
*   Claiming to define the "next step" for humanity without abandoning Islamic identity and tradition, building modern structures in the form of the Kaaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
This is presented as a "brave move" and a significant challenge to previous notions of secularization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

Proverbs and idioms are ubiquitous across all languages, serving as anonymous expressions of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

## Presence Across Languages
It is certain that many languages possess a comparable wealth of proverbs and idioms to Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

## Impact of Modernization and Written Culture
In strongly modernized languages, such as certain Western European languages, proverbs and idioms tend to be marginalized, pushed into the background, and subsequently forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Societies that develop with a strong written culture and formal school education also see a diminishing role for proverbs and idioms across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

### Historical Example: English Language
The [[role_of_english_in_global_dominance | English language]] from the 16th and 17th centuries, for instance, exhibited an immense richness in proverbs and idioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. However, contemporary English possesses very few proverbs and idioms compared to its past, a change attributed to cultural shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. The [[role_of_english_in_global_dominance | English language]] has also been documented more comprehensively at every stage of its development than Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

### Diminishing Effect
Overall, there is a perceived weakening and decrease in the use of idioms within contemporary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

JD Vance has been declared [[political_situation_and_predictions_in_the_usa | Donald Trump]]'s Vice Presidential candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. His background and political ascent are seen as significant, particularly concerning his connection to the American working class.

## Background and "Hillbilly Elegy"
A movie, "Hillbilly," exists about JD Vance's life and autobiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The term "Hillbilly" refers to a group residing in a specific region of America, notably around the Appalachian Mountains in Kentucky, often perceived as somewhat "backward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Vance's story is described as an "American Dream story," albeit one with Hollywood clich√©s, yet ultimately successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The speaker recommends watching the movie to understand his biography and glean necessary lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Unprecedented Rise from the Working Class
JD Vance is considered the first person since the early 20th century to emerge from the American working or poor class to become a candidate for President or Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This represents a significant shift from the typical political landscape of the last 30 to 40 years, where presidential and vice-presidential candidates usually originate from the wealthiest, deeply rooted societal segments, or the upper bureaucracy and technocracy class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Vance's background is notably different, as he is described as someone who "really suffered from poverty and misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

> "Eee this is a new event and it seems to be a very very successful choice for the Vice Presidential election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

## Political Appeal and Future Projections
Vance possesses a unique political characteristic: there is "no strong feeling against him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Unlike figures such as [[political_situation_and_predictions_in_the_usa | Kamala Harris]] or [[political_situation_and_predictions_in_the_usa | Biden]], he is not hated or strongly rejected by a significant portion of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This broad acceptance, even if not ideal, positions him as a "not a bad person" in the eyes of 60% to 70% of society if he shows success and avoids major mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

It is predicted that Vance will remain a very important leading figure in [[power_dynamics_and_social_organization | world politics]] for the next 8 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

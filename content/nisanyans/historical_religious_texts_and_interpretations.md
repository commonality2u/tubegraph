## The Nature of Faith and Unquestioning Belief

Faith is characterized as believing in something impossible, even if it is proven to be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is the act of believing in something that cannot be given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. An example is [[exploration_of_cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_religion_and_sacredness | Abraham's faith]], which involved submitting to God's command to sacrifice his son without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Unquestioning faith can be woven into human and community life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

It is suggested that faith cannot be challenged or falsified by applying tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Faith can involve maintaining a belief despite arguments against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and may require completely ignoring the rational mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. True faith, as presented in some contexts, means trusting in the heart something the mind cannot hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, such as a virgin birth or resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Unconditional belief is presented as a path to salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Ultimately, salvation is achieved by concentrating all spiritual existence on one thing, understood as God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This perspective implies an absolute way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Jewish Religious Texts and Interpretation

The Jewish religion is characterized by an extraordinarily complicated series of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, such as dietary laws (e.g., not mixing milk and meat) and Sabbath observances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These rules are followed because God commanded them, not necessarily for logical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### The Torah and Old Testament Composition

The Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, is comprised of 39 books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.
The first five books, collectively known as the Torah or Pentateuch, include:
*   The Book of Creation (Genesis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>
*   The Book of Exodus from Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>
*   Information about counting in the desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>
*   The Book of Deuteronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>

The first two books are more historical, while the latter three are primarily a set of laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Following these are the books of the prophets, including figures like Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. The latest work in this collection is the book by the Prophet Daniel, which seems to have been added in the first century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. The book of Job, for example, tells the story of a person who endures troubles but does not lose faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The "Song of Solomon" is described as a wedding song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>, and the lamentations of Jeremiah are a poignant text describing the misery after the Babylonian occupation of Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

Many of these stories are human-centered, with God's involvement often presented through human values rather than direct first-person speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

### Textual Inconsistencies and Sources

In the Book of Creation, there are two distinct creation stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>, presented on separate pages, indicating different authors or origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | Textual analysis]] suggests that some parts of these texts were deleted, leaving gaps in the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Adventures of other gods or actions by other parties were eliminated much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>. Scholars have identified different writers for various sections, such as the second ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, and writers like "Simli" and "a separate writer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>, noting stylistic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

Archeological findings, particularly from the 1970s and 1980s, have significantly impacted the understanding of these texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. These findings suggest that the narratives, like the story of the kingdom, are often mythological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>, created for specific purposes, such as establishing an official history or national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Old Testament Narrative

The story of the Jewish nation, as told in the texts, involves the Jews returning to their ancestral lands, fighting wars, conquering Canaan, and establishing a kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. The United Kingdom under David and Solomon is depicted as a powerful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>, with Solomon portrayed as the richest and most magnificent ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. After Solomon, the kingdom is said to have divided into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. These narratives often include divine punishment for sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

However, archeological evidence paints a different picture. Jerusalem, around 700 BC, was a small town with a population of approximately five thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. After the collapse of the Kingdom of Israel in the north, Jerusalem's population significantly increased from 5,000 to 25,000 around 700-712 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. This suggests there was no grand kingdom during the time of David or Solomon in the way the texts describe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. The existence of a developed city life with class separation, a management system, and officials to record epics and laws would be necessary to produce such texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

The texts demonstrate a continuous theme of competition between the State of Israel (north) and the Jewish state (south) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. The northern kingdom is consistently depicted as making mistakes and committing crimes, facing divine punishment, while the greatest heroes and epics are attributed to Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>. This suggests a narrative designed to elevate Judah over Israel. [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Archaeological records]] indicate that the northern kingdom was a rich and powerful entity for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>, making it difficult for Jerusalem to initially gain central importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Evolution of Religious Scholarship and Institutions

Historically, religious texts and their interpretations have undergone significant evolution. The Zoroastrian religion, before Christ, began to develop a concept of direct divine intervention as a source of truth, rather than relying solely on ancestral traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. This shift led to the idea that if a text came from God, it must be indisputable and absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.

In the early periods of Christianity, important [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | discussions]] took place in the Middle East, particularly in cities like Antioch, Urfa, and Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>. Many of these discussions and the literature produced were in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:26">[02:37:26]</a>. The weakening Roman Empire in the 4th-6th centuries saw Middle Eastern Christianity become a central hub for these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:50">[02:37:50]</a>.

The [[development_and_influence_of_religious_institutions | establishment of madrasahs]] (religious schools) played a crucial role in the preservation and interpretation of texts. For example, after the Huawei meltdown in the 100-200 years following Christ, teachers from Urfa settled in Nusaybin and established an important madrasah that lasted for 1400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:18">[02:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:29">[02:33:29]</a>. This lineage of educational institutions, from Nusaybin to Baghdad and Andalusia, eventually influenced the establishment of early European universities in Italy and Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:26">[02:44:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>. Subjects and methodologies discussed in these Islamic madrasahs were later adopted and translated for use in European universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a>.

### Critical Historical Analysis of Texts

Starting around the Enlightenment Age (1700s-1800s), a new adventure in textual analysis began at universities like Göttingen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This period saw the rise of scholars rigorously examining texts like the Hebrew Bible, looking at their Abrahamic, Aramaic, and Greek roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. This critical approach revealed inconsistencies, such as the two creation stories in Genesis, leading to questions about the origins and composition of these sacred texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.

This field of study, particularly driven by German scholars, has been at the forefront of critical analysis, often highlighting that narratives like the one about David and Solomon's kingdoms are more mythological than historically factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. These scholarly findings, while not openly calling the narratives "lies," politely suggest that they are related to the establishment of national identity and religious origins within specific political contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

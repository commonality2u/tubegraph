The modern perception of the Ottoman Empire in Turkey, especially as depicted in television series, often presents a strange, militaristic, aggressive, and conquest-focused image to the religious common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, this image has little to do with the reality of the 19th century Ottoman Empire, and the 17th-18th centuries represented a very different world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Ottoman Cultural Characteristics

Initially, there is a question whether Ottoman culture was truly bigoted, conservative, and introverted, or if it possessed flexibility and characteristics that could have led to different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Historical Periods of the Ottoman Empire

The history of the Ottoman Empire can be broadly categorized into three distinct periods, none of which are very similar to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### The Period of Establishment (up to 1500s)

The first period saw the establishment of an empire with incredible speed and dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This era brought innovations outside existing Islamic culture, introducing a new type of Islamic Empire that was extraordinarily successful for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The empire was built on extremely strong central control, with the economy brought under state control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This was a rational model, learning from the failed examples of the Abbasid and Byzantine states, systematically attempting to purify itself from their mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. While short-term successful, this model almost inevitably led to a great collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### The Period of Decline (16th to 18th Centuries)

By the 16th century, the direction of global trade was changing, and Europe was rapidly gaining strength in technology, economy, and population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. The highly centralized and fragile Ottoman model, akin to the Soviet model, could only survive for about a century before leading to terrible social destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The Ottoman Empire experienced one of the longest and most painful destruction stories in world history, lasting approximately 350 years from the late 1500s to 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This process transformed Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, once among the world's richest and most civilized geographies, into a ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

This destruction was due to the collapse of the production and management models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. The state failed to provide security, and it was inherently against any organization or large gathering of people outside its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. By the 18th century, feudal lords had emerged in every town and province across the empire, effectively ruling small armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. The state structure devolved into a collection of looting gangs without the infrastructure for effective governance, tax collection, or military management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

#### The Problem of Surplus Value Exploitation

The Ottoman Empire achieved an unprecedented level of surplus value exploitation, which was its great success but also its great disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. Initially, this exploitation seemed highly productive, funding magnificent mosques and palaces that earned admiration from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. However, this exploitation eventually led to peasants dying of hunger, making the system unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>. The inability to strike a balance in tax collection – neither too little nor too much – led to either societal collapse or a peasant society unable to generate central culture or resist stronger states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.

### The Reform Period (18th and 19th Centuries)

By the early 1800s, it was clear that the Ottoman Empire was heading towards complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This led to a period of reform, starting with Selim III and continuing under Mahmud II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. The model for these reforms was undeniably Europe, with the aim to learn European languages, secrets of success, and apply them in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

Despite the radical nature of these reforms, they largely failed to achieve desired goals because they remained confined to a narrow elite circle in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. This elite, numbering only in the thousands in today's terms, made a great effort to assimilate European civilization and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. While significant change occurred within this limited circle, it did not reflect sufficiently in the provinces and led to unforeseen disasters, often the opposite of what was intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

#### Challenges of Modernization

Unlike Japan and Russia, which successfully undertook modernization and westernization, the Ottoman Empire failed due to its heterogeneous society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Japan had an extremely homogeneous society and was an island, while Russia, despite being an empire, managed to largely homogenize its diverse tribes into a common culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire, by contrast, was a union established by conquest and tyranny, and its communities were unwilling to lose their national or religious identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. As a result, the Ottoman Empire could never become a nation or a homogeneous social entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. When the political structure was questioned or transformed, every identity group began to assert itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. The Greek independence marked a major turning point, as it signaled the formation of a separate political entity based on identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

The ruling class was hesitant to embark on deeper reforms because the empire's power rested on the principle of conquest, which allowed the Muslim minority to be the sole rulers, excluding others from military and administrative roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. Shaking this foundation carried the risk of physical destruction for the Muslim minority, as seen with Catherine the Great's project to revive a new Byzantine Empire in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Ottoman Elite

The **cultural and moral decay of Turkish elites** is characterized by a prevailing conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>. This conservatism is defined as an inability to find a way out of existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.

From the late 1550s (Kanuni's last years) and deepening through the reigns of Selim III, Murat, and Ahmet (1620s), the ruling class faced an economic blockage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>. This led to ruthless, bloody internal struggles as the "pie" to be shared shrank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. A severe central dictatorship emerged where any failure or doubt could lead to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. These internal conflicts within the ruling class, especially from Ahmet I to Mehmet IV, reached terrible levels due to weakening economic foundations and dwindling sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>. The fundamental mechanism of the empire – conquest and plunder – had stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>.

By the reign of Mehmet IV and peaking in the Tulip Period, a feeling of "enough, we are a poor but beautiful nation" prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. The elite adopted a perspective focused on continuing their refined life in Istanbul, rather than risking everything for fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.

The **cultural and moral decay of Turkish elites** led to a deepening cultural gap between the elite and the general populace by the Tulip Era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:00">[34:19:00]</a>. The elite lived in an "ivory tower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:00">[38:54:00]</a>. Their culture was described as very "Baroque," foreign to modern sensibilities, and heavily self-referential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>. For example, the 1732 dictionary *Lehçetü'l Lügat* by Şeyhülislam Esad Efendi has a preface so sophisticated and filled with obscure literary and historical references that only a tiny, elite circle could understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>. This illustrates the elite's desire to maintain exclusivity rather than widespread understanding or education, explaining why the printing press was resisted for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>. The purpose of this elite was to exploit the populace, not to educate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.

### Recommended Reading

To understand the mentality of the Ottoman elite during this period, foreign travel books from the 18th century are highly recommended, as they offer detailed observations from an outside perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. For internal perspectives, one needs a strong command of Ottoman Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:00">[37:41:00]</a>. Works like Cevdet Pasha's history (a continuation of *Cevdet başarı*'s books) are useful for understanding the mentality of the Mahmut period of the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. Ibn'ul Mahmut Kemal Inal's "last grand viziers" is also mentioned as stimulating reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:17:00">[38:17:00]</a>.

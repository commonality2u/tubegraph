The [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] is described as an ongoing struggle with deep historical roots and significant contemporary implications, frequently analyzed through the lens of war legitimacy and regional stability.

## The Situation in Gaza

Gaza is characterized as an "open-air concentration camp" where people have been imprisoned for 17 years, subjected to starvation and periodic bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Inhabitants cannot travel outside and face "incredibly humiliating treatment" when attempting to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The area is likened to a "Marova ghetto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Organizing a "Rock Festival for peace" outside this "concentration camp" is deemed "the extreme end of shamelessness, cowardice and dishonesty," and "psychopathic behavior," similar to Nazi officers having fun outside Auschwitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Critique of Israel's Actions and Policies

### Historical Stance and Evolution
For many years, the opinion was held that [[Palestine and Israel conflict | Israel]] was "more right" in the [[IsraelPalestine conflict and implications | Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] due to its historical claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, objective analysis suggests the Palestinians' claim to rights is "a little stronger," comparing claims of recent generations versus those from 2000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This perspective shifted with the "first gas bombardment," which changed the incident in the speaker's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Israel is accused of continuing an "Apar regime, a regime of oppression and tyranny" for 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Legitimacy of Response
Taking sides in the [[IsraelPalestine conflict and implications | Israel-Palestine War]] is considered unwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The attitude of the [[western_media_and_propaganda_in_conflict_reporting | Western press]] and Turkish educated classes, who attribute direct responsibility, is described as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. While the justification of slaughter can be debated, the prevalent attitude, especially in TÃ¼rkiye, is characterized by "rabid hostility towards Arabs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This stance legitimizes all Israeli actions, including bombing and destroying, in response to Palestinian actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This view is considered "despicable" and "dishonorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Israel has reportedly bombed the "packed concentration camp" of Gaza three times a year for 17 years, indiscriminately targeting civilians, soldiers, women, children, elderly, hospitals, and places of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Dehumanization and Ethnic Cleansing
The Israeli Defense Minister's statement, "These people are not human, they are animals, they are human. We will destroy them. We are cutting off their electricity. We are cutting off their food supplies. We will cut off their water," is cited as a natural attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This behavior is compared to the German occupation force in Vagos in 1944, which imprisoned a large population in a ghetto, starved them, and hunted them, justifying their actions by labeling the people as "not human, they are animals, they are an inferior race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. It's considered "despicable" for a nation whose existence is based on revenge for oppression to justify similar oppression with the same discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## The Question of Israeli Foreknowledge
There are two possibilities regarding the recent attack:
1.  **Israel was completely unaware**: This is considered unlikely, given the scale of the operation and the lack of immediate reaction when borders were crossed, which are "not normal things" and "not possible things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
2.  **Israel either organized or turned a blind eye**: Many believe Israel organized or allowed the attack to occur to achieve a "final solution" to the Palestinian/Gaza problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Cutting off gas, electricity, water, and food for more than three days would result in widespread death, meaning people cannot survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This is seen as a "planned and conscious behavior," a view held by approximately 30% of commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The majority of commentators consider the attack "very suspicious" and designed by Israel for a specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

The counter-argument to the second possibility is that such an event, involving hundreds slaughtered and soldiers captured, is unacceptable for a small country like Israel and highly risky, regardless of the intended revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Israel's Sustainability and Regional Position

### Economic and Strategic Viability
Israel is deemed "not an economically sustainable country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Since its establishment, it has received over a trillion dollars in support from America and "has not managed to stand on its own feet economically for 70 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. It is also considered "not a sustainable country in diplomatic or strategic terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Due to a combination of Muslim "bigotry and fanaticism" and its "mindless defiant policies," Israel has made the [[Middle East conflicts and ceasefire in Israel | Islamic world]], exceeding 1.5 billion people, its enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. With a population of 7.5 million, Israel is surrounded by an Arab and Islamic world 200 times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. While Israel had technological superiority and performed better in wars in the 1960s and 70s, the Arabs have since become "wise" and "educated," making future conflicts' outcomes "very doubtful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. The extent of America's unconditional support for Israel is questioned, especially after potential future economic or domestic policy changes in the [[United States and Israels strategy in the Middle East | US]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

### Demographic and Social Challenges
Israel's population is largely middle-class and above, with a high level of education and welfare, lacking a significant working class or peasant class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This forces Israel to use Palestinians for employment, a "kind of slave labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Unlike modern capitalist societies where citizenship rights and ideological affiliation (homeland, nation, flag, religion) are granted to workers, Israel's working class (Palestinians) is not given citizenship or is treated as second-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This creates an "endless impasse" for the working class lacking emotional connection to the state's discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Their Feasibility
Most countries, excluding America and the European Union, advocate for a two-state solution, where [[Palestine and Israel conflict | Palestine]] is given independence with two equal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. While legally valid, this solution is considered impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. The argument is that Israelis need Palestinians as workers, and Palestinians need Israelis as employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. Instead, a single state is proposed where Palestinians (Muslims, Christians) and Jews have equal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. However, Israel's unique foundation conditions prevent it from adopting this modern system, unlike most other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This situation, where the ruling class and lower class have different religions and affiliations, similar to the Ottoman society before the 19th century, is questioned for its sustainability in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

## Precedents and Broader Conflict Implications
The possibility of Israel disappearing is considered "very strong," similar to the Crusader Kingdom of Israel founded in the same geography in 1099, which lasted only 88-89 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. A potential regional war involving Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Iraq going to war together is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. The outcome of such a conflict is "not at all certain," with Iran potentially having an advantage over the US if nuclear weapons are not used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. The US's defeat in Afghanistan, by a country without an army or state, is cited as an example of its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.

There is a 51% chance of a "very serious war" breaking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. The nature of this war, particularly regarding nuclear escalation, is uncertain due to unknown advancements in nuclear technology since the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Putin's recently announced new nuclear missile system, if functional, could "turn everything upside down" in nuclear strategy, requiring rethinking from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. This new system, with undetectable, low-flying missiles that can orbit the world, could nullify the balance of terror built on mutually assured destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. The leaders of the American and Western sides are described as "psychopaths" and "perverts" who might initiate such a war if faced with complete economic impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. NATO, the US, and the EU are seen as "cornered very badly" and on the "verge of destruction, collapse and death," making them highly dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

## Turkey's Stance
[[turkeys_foreign_policy_on_israelpalestine_conflict | Turkey's foreign policy]], especially since 2014, has been a "desperate effort" to remain out of possible major conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. As a NATO member, Turkey will face "very heavy pressure" to intervene on the NATO front, potentially being unable to avoid war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. These efforts are supported as a "wise effort," and if successful in preventing Turkey's children from dying, the current ruling cadre should be thanked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Turkey is following an "extremely cautious policy regarding Israel" and will not participate in the Arab conflict, aiming to stay away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

## Azerbaijan-Israel Relations
The relationship between Israel and Azerbaijan is simple: Azerbaijan has oil, which Israel needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. Additionally, the hostility between Azerbaijan and Iran suits Israel, which maintains an "irrational" policy of hostility towards Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Thus, Israel befriends Azerbaijan on the principle that "Iran's enemy is my friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. Beyond these factors, personal interests and bribery are considered significant in foreign relations, especially in countries like Azerbaijan and under leaders like Netanyahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. The deterioration of Turkey-Azerbaijan relations due to this friendship is not expected in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. It is hoped that relations between Turkey-Armenia and Azerbaijan-Armenia will soften after the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

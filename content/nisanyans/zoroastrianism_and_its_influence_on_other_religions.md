Zoroastrianism, an ancient Persian religion, has discernible influences on later Abrahamic faiths, particularly Judaism and Christianity. The extent of its textual and doctrinal impact is a subject of ongoing historical and archaeological study.

## Zoroastrian Texts

The original Zoroastrian texts, known as the Avesta, were reportedly transmitted orally and only came to be written down much later than the advent of Islam, specifically during the period immediately preceding Islam, in the last period of the Sassanids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. The oldest known texts, referred to as "Bombay Parsi texts," and the hymns called Gathas, are dated around 1200 BC, but there are significant uncertainties regarding the health and original creation date of the full Avestan text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

In addition to the Avesta, a series of religious texts known as Zend texts were written during the Sassanid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. These Zend texts are interpretations of and additions to the Avesta, written in the Pahlavi language (Old Persian before Islam), and were accepted as semi-sacred texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. They were widely available as manuscripts during the time of Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, although it's unclear if the ultimate doctrinal text existed in written form then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

## Influence on Judaism

The influence of Zoroastrianism on Judaism became apparent during the period when the Jewish people were under Iranian sovereignty.

### Terminology and Concepts
*   **"Religion" (Name):** The term "religion" (as a proper name for a faith) appears in the Torah during the time of prophets Ezra and Nehemiah, who were Iranian civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This term is an Iranian word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. Ezra, known as Uzayr in the Quran, was tasked by King Darius with rebuilding the Temple, and Nehemiah was a Jewish priest in Iran sent to Jerusalem to finalize the Torah text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Concept of Satan:** The concept of Satan, an evil principle or rival to God, emerges in Judaism during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. Before the Babylonian captivity, the idea of an entity opposing the single God was not clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. This dualistic idea of good and evil, which simplifies theology and explains the existence of evil in the world, is clearly influenced by Zoroastrianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   **Afterlife and Reward/Punishment:** In the early books of the Torah, rewards and punishments from God are depicted as earthly, such as protection from enemies, defeat of Canaanites or Palestinians, or divine intervention like stopping the sun to ensure victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. There is no concept of a giant or reward in the old books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. The idea of the immortality of the soul emerged simultaneously with Jesus, in Palestine and the Greek world, which suggests it is a development after the Torah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>. Discussions about the afterlife are more prominent in later texts like the Talmud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. The interpretation of places like the "Valley of Tears" (likely the Valley of Hinnom, filled with corpses by Babylonians) as a place for the wicked after death is a later, figurative interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

## Influence on Christianity

Christianity, being a later Abrahamic religion, also shows similar influences. The concept of the immortality of the soul is a notable innovation within Abrahamic religions, appearing largely in Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. This concept, along with ideas of post-mortem punishment and reward, became common around the time of Christ, appearing in Judaism, Christianity, and other contemporary cults like Serapis and Mithras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

### Comparison of Monotheistic Ideologies
Radical monotheism, which advocates for the destruction of all other temples and the systematic development of a single cult, is a hallmark of the Jewish and Christian traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. This is distinct from polytheism, which often functions as a diplomatic tool, where alliances or trade relations lead to the adoption and respect of foreign gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. The consistent theme in the Torah of punishment for worshipping foreign gods (like those of Babylonians, Phoenicians, Philistines, Canaanites, Assyrians) reflects a political movement opposing alliances with foreign states and their associated deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. The shift towards radical monotheism, championed by figures like King Josiah and prophets like Jeremiah, involved the elimination of provincial shrines and local temples to centralize worship in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This intense drive against idolatry was not easily achieved, suggesting that polytheistic or semi-polytheistic practices (like mediation through idols or saints) were widespread among the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

While specific direct links to Indian or Chinese religions for the concept of soul immortality are not definitively stated, it is acknowledged that such philosophical and theological questions are universal, leading to similar stories across different cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. Ancient communication routes for goods like lapis lazuli from Afghanistan to Egypt, or amber from northern Russia to Egypt, suggest that ideas also traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. The adoption of ideas depends on whether they find "fertile soil" and meet local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

The terms "education" and "brainwashing" share similar techniques and methods [00:40:27]. In fact, "education" can be considered a type of "brainwashing," and "brainwashing" a type of "education" [00:40:30]. The speaker suggests that the overarching term for both is "indoctrination" [00:41:04].

## Defining Indoctrination
Indoctrination involves making a person accept certain ideas, styles of reasoning, themes, or myths through repetition, insistence, the use of authority, and persuasion [00:40:49].

## The Key Distinction
The difference between education and brainwashing, according to the speaker, lies in societal acceptance:
*   If the indoctrination is based on **common social acceptance**, it is called [[Impact of education on secular society|education]] [00:41:14].
*   If the indoctrination is perceived by the majority of people whose words and ideas are valued in society as an "attack," "rape," or "lie," then it is considered brainwashing [00:41:40].

## The "Children Test"
A simple test to distinguish between education and brainwashing is to consider if a person believes the indoctrination is right for their own children [00:41:56].
*   If a person is willing to hand over their own children to this indoctrination, its name is [[Role of philosophy in education|education]] [00:42:15].
*   However, if they refuse, saying "My children will not be my children. They are special. I will not give them to you," and deem it "brainwashing," then it is considered brainwashing [00:42:22].

## Education in [[Educational system and values in Trkiye|Trkiye]]
The speaker also touches upon the [[Modern academic issues and education critique|Turkish education system]], questioning how one might "become stupid" within it, implying that life experiences beyond formal [[Educational system and values in Trkiye|education]] are crucial for broadening horizons [00:59:26].

Historically, women have often been perceived as not having been given "necessary rights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, one perspective suggests that the absence of women in prominent roles across various fields is not solely due to oppression or male domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Historical Presence in Arts and Politics

Across [[historical_perspective_on_civilizations_and_womens_roles | various cultures]] and historical periods, including ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean and American native cultures, and Islamic culture, there is a perceived lack of women dominating fields like visual arts and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Similarly, in politics, there are very few instances of women rising to the level of geniuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, even when opportunities are ostensibly provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This perspective challenges the notion that societal oppression is the sole or primary reason for this observed pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Biological and Psychological Underpinnings

A key argument is that women and men possess different biological functions, stemming from distinct genetic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These biological differences lead to varying psychological advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Women's Biological Role
The primary biological function for women is considered to be related to birth and child-rearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This includes ensuring the safety of the child, looking after them, feeding them, and preventing their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Men's Biological Role
Conversely, men are seen as having evolved to compensate for their biological "dysfunctions" or weaknesses in the biological field by excelling in other areas, manifesting through skills and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Human Nature and Animal Analogies
This perspective views human beings as fundamentally similar to animals, particularly primates like monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The functions of males and females in mammals are described as obvious and logical, driven by biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It is argued that human beings are essentially animals whose primary function revolves around sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, with distinct roles for men and women within these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Modern Societal Views on Equality
In contemporary society, discussions about equality, such as granting women certain rights, are acknowledged as important and necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, the underlying premise for understanding human behavior and [[cultural_and_societal_norms | societal norms]] is rooted in the idea that humans are fundamentally animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It is suggested that modern discourse often prioritizes "ideological lies" over "objective truths" regarding these biological realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

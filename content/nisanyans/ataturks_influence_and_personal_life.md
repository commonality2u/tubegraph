## Personal Life

### Adopted Children and Related Gossip

There has been long-standing gossip throughout [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk's]] life regarding his relationship with his adopted daughters and rumors of him having mistresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This gossip is well-known and has been implicitly or explicitly mentioned in his memoirs, particularly those written by foreigners, and in the foreign press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The speaker notes that this is not something he invented, and its existence is not doubted on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

A core question raised is whether it is morally and legally defensible for an adult, single man to adopt adolescent girls and keep them in his private apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The speaker states that it is "impossible to avoid such a gossip" and that the mere fact this gossip was created is "a disgrace in itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. He maintains that the act of adoption itself was "wrong," even if no inappropriate physical contact occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

### Abdurrahim

The topic of Abdurrahim, an adopted son of [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]], is also discussed, often brought up as a defense mechanism to counter criticisms about the adopted daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. The speaker notes that this is a "much-discussed" and "dangerous" subject in Turkey, but it cannot be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

In 1916, while on duty in Van, [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] took an orphaned 8-year-old child named Abdurrahim with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Abdurrahim stayed with [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] on various fronts, including in Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. When [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] returned to Istanbul in November 1918, Abdurrahim accompanied him and resided in his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Later, in Ankara, Abdurrahim was with [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] in Çankaya, serving in his personal service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

However, in November or December 1922, just before Latife Hanım (Atatürk's wife) moved into Çankaya, Abdurrahim was sent to Izmir to live with [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk's]] mother, Zübeyde Hanım, for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Abdurrahim returned to the Çankaya mansion after [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] divorced Latife Hanım <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This raises questions about why he was sent away upon marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Later, Abdurrahim was sent to Germany for education, becoming an engineer, and lived until the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. The speaker points out that the fact that the founder of the Republic had an adopted son (theoretically an heir) is largely unknown because the subject of Abdurrahim was a "big taboo" until 10-15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

### Personality Traits and Relationships

The speaker, referencing a poem by Nazım Hikmet, describes [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] as a person with an "extraordinarily strong personality" who "reduced everyone around him to nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. He is characterized as someone who "trusted no one but his soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

A prominent trait highlighted is his pattern of "betraying everyone who was close to him, everyone without exception, whether male or female" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Examples include his early youth friends like Colonel Arif Bey, Fethi Okyar, Rauf Orbay, Kazım Karabekir, Finance Minister Cavit Bey, prominent figures of the Union and Progress Party, Enver, Nurettin Pasha, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, İsmet İnönü, his lover Fikriye, and Latife Hanım <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. It is stated that he "used and threw away each of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. This is described as a "sociopathic" personality trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

Nazım Hikmet's adjectives for [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] are "sarcastic, belligerent, cunning and dominating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, and "A victorious and magnificent Gambler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. The speaker agrees with the "gambler" description, stating that [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] "gambled wildly throughout his life" and that "every political step he took was a gamble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy|Political Strategies and Influence]]

### Ottoman Context and Modernization

The speaker contextualizes [[Leadership and decisionmaking of Ataturk|Atatürk's]] actions within the historical period. In 1922, the Ottoman state was "pretty much ruined with all its institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. The objective was to "rebuild" the state and "protect your own power and life," knowing that one mistake could lead to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

In this context, it was a logical sequence that whoever took advantage of the opportunity would:
*   Make a strong move for modernization, which the Ottomans had struggled with for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   Create a national excitement, even if fake, in an economically collapsed country with a third of its population as immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   Use rhetoric of "homeland, nation, Sakarya and infidels pouring into the sea" to rally ordinary citizens, while elites in Istanbul and Izmir embraced Westernism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   Hang a few comrades-in-arms to maintain discipline in a tradition of intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   Take deterrent measures against Kurds to prevent further state disintegration, following centuries of territorial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   Attempt to strike a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism in a world where the dominant power was unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   Seize territory, like a piece from Syria, when opportunities arose, such as France's weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.

The speaker asserts that these actions were "so obvious" and that "no matter who it was," these steps "were going to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

### Relationship with British Services

[[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks wartime activities|Atatürk]] had a "close relationship with the British services" in the early stages of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>. However, the speaker cautions against concluding that [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] was simply "a man of the British" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.

The speaker points to the "staged fight" of losing Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria in the last 40 days of World War I as "very obviously an agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. He posits a "reasonable scenario" of an agreement stemming from [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk's]] presence in Vienna and Karlsbad (ostensibly for health) in May-June 1918, coincidentally when the King of England's brother was also in Vienna, seeking a separate peace with Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

Upon his immediate return to Istanbul after the Sultan's death in June, [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] was accepted by Vahdettin and appointed Commander of the Palestine front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. His first act in Palestine was to remove the German Chief of Staff, Liman von Sanders, leading to an immediate defeat when the British attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>. After returning to Istanbul, [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries|Atatürk]] maintained close, frequent contact with the director of British intelligence in the Ottoman Empire in 1918-1919, only ceasing contact when he went to Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.

British policy at the time sought to:
*   Eliminate Enver and his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.
*   Keep the French out of the game, preventing them from touching Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a>.
*   Prevent Russia's influence from extending to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.
*   Ensure a modern Turkish state, friendly to the West, would be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

[[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments|Atatürk]] fit this framework perfectly, and British support for him stemmed from these strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

### Similarities with Reza Shah Pahlavi

[[Leadership and decisionmaking of Ataturk|Atatürk's]] life and modernization programs are described as "very similar" to those of Reza Shah Pahlavi of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. Both were soldiers who seized power, and their modernization and westernization programs were "exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. This included:
*   Finishing off tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.
*   Establishing Western educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.
*   Creating state-owned factories and sales stores (like Sümerbank in Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.

The speaker believes these similarities are due to the "spirit of the age" and global standards after World War I, rather than being centrally directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. The idea of how to reform a country devastated by war and chaos, similar to the Soviet Bolshevik Revolution, was a "globally spreading idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.

### [[Analysis of Atatrks legacy in modern Turkey|Legacy and Criticism of Kemalism]]

The speaker states that "the problem is [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments|Mustafa Kemal's]] disciples, not yesterday's, but today's problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemals political strategies and legacy|Atatürk]] is viewed as an "icon" that represents "contemporary Turkish racism and the state worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. This icon is seen as a "symbol of a moral blindness that a priori justifies all kinds of dishonesty undertaken in the name of the state and the homeland and the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

The "semi-educated and cheap modernity-polished classes of Türkiye" who uphold this icon are criticized for spewing "hatred and complexes against the outside world" and losing "the opportunity to establish emotional communication with their own common strata in the domestic sphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. This leads them to marginalize themselves politically and embrace state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

The speaker describes Kemalism as a "pathology specific to Türkiye," which is a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. While the Kemalist sect verbally rejects Islam, it is presented as the "present-day representative of the arrogance of the nation," which is seen as the "deepest and most malignant dimension of historical Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. The underlying theory of society is summarized as "We conquered, Therefore, we are right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

This mindset prevents understanding and emotional closeness with neighboring peoples and subjects of Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This is particularly evident in the "ignorance bordering on stupidity on the Kurdish issue," which is "Türkiye's most important issue today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. The speaker concludes that "unless we get rid of the Kemalism disease," there is no hope for "civilization in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

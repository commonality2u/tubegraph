Education, particularly primary school education, is considered a primary step in establishing a [[secularism_and_freedom_of_expression_in_religion | secular society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Education System in Turkey

The education system in the Republic of Turkey is described as a "disaster," comparable to very few places in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. It is characterized as a mechanism "completely based on ignorance and stupidity," which has been "quite effective and successful" in its objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

The widespread ignorance among the majority of the population in Turkey, particularly those who have not traveled or received education abroad, is attributed to this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. This ignorance extends to:
*   Lack of knowledge about other countries, their history, and current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
*   Absence of understanding regarding basic moral concepts, human morality, and humanity's cultural achievements over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   Severe immaturity in disciplined thinking, leading to an atrophy of the ability to analyze, interpret, and understand complex texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. Even "educated" people in Turkey exhibit this level of ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

This system is viewed as a "collapse of a toxic education system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. Unlike some other countries (e.g., New Generation Americans), Turkey lacks the "cultural accumulation inherited from older generations" or any "accumulated" cultural institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.

Furthermore, foreign language education in Turkey is considered to be at one of the lowest levels globally, particularly English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. This is seen as a result of a "conscious policy" to prevent influence from external ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The quality of translations from foreign languages in the publishing world is also described as incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

When a country's cultural resources are so diminished, it must rely on external sources for cultural input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Learning from other countries, even those perceived as "low," broadens horizons due to their different human experiences and cultural equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

## Education and Indoctrination

The transformation of the population in the Eastern Black Sea region into its current state is attributed to a violent process of [[education_versus_indoctrination | indoctrination and education]] in the Republican period, following the elimination of Christian Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. This policy, particularly after 1950-1953, was a "violent Turkification" operation aimed at reinforcing loyalty to Turkey and Turkishness in a strategically vulnerable region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

## Positive Aspects of Education in Socialist Countries

In contrast, some socialist countries, such as the Soviet Union, achieved significant successes in education, a "successful performance that cannot be compared to Western societies in many ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. These achievements, alongside providing minimum standard housing for all citizens, are considered substantial accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

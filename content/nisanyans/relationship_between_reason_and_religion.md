From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Discussions regarding the intersection of reason and religion often elicit strong, negative reactions from diametrically opposed viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One perspective questions what reason and language have to do with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, while another, often rooted in [[philosophy_of_rational_thought_versus_faith | Enlightenment philosophy]], asks if reason and religion are inherently opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The claim that reason is independent of religion can lead to reason itself becoming another subject of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Defining Rational Thought

The evolution of the human race has been driven by a specific way of thinking, a method of confronting the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Humanity constantly faces a bombardment of data and phenomena it cannot immediately comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. From infancy, the human mind copes with this complexity by proposing and testing assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

This method involves:
1.  **Hypothesis Formation**: When encountering unexplained events (e.g., the sun rising at a certain hour, feeling sleepy in the evening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, humans form hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
2.  **Testing and Falsification**: These assumptions are then tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. If a contrary result is encountered, the initial response might be to question one's perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> or to refine the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Revision or Rejection**: Repeated contrary evidence leads to the conclusion that the theory is wrong, prompting a search for a more correct theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

This approach, based on falsifiable assumptions, is the way of learning, the way of science, and a rational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Science is defined not by being true, but by being a method where all propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. A scientific thesis explains phenomena, and is accepted until a brighter, more original view comes along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

## The Evolution of Religion

In its early stages, religion appears to have been part of a "scientific" activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. For example, people getting lost in a forest might be explained by "Jinn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, or the victory of the Achaeans in Troy by Apollo taking their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. These early religious hypotheses were, in a sense, scientific because they were testable and falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The early lines of the Torah, describing the separation of earth and sky, can be seen as a form of scientific effort, similar to a "Big Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

However, the evolution of religion led to a different stage, where it became a social function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Judaism is seen as a significant turning point in this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Unlike Greek religion with its mythological gods, the Jewish God actively intervenes in this world and directs history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. Questioning this God and the stories about Him becomes politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

This leads to the idea of a God that becomes increasingly abstract, incomprehensible, and, crucially, unfalsifiable by any real-world evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. The God of the Quran or the Bible is framed in such a way that for any question, there is an answer, even if it explains evil or injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This shift signifies a key turning point in the [[philosophy_of_rational_thought_versus_faith | relationship between reason and faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

### Faith vs. Scientific Fact

The distinction is highlighted by the story of Thomas, who doubts Jesus's resurrection until he touches his wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Jesus implies that believing *after* touching has no value; true belief is believing without empirical proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Early Christian thinkers like Tertullian embraced this notion, famously stating, "I believe to the point of absurdity because it is impossible to believe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. The definition of faith, by definition, is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

In contemporary debates, especially with Muslims, this point is reached when unprovable or even disproven things are encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. For instance, rational arguments for eating pork (economical, biological, sociological benefits) are met with the final answer: "Because I believe this. I am not obliged to question this. I cannot question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This highlights a point where faith and reason fundamentally diverge, as faith is asserted as a principle that *cannot* be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

## Modern Approaches to Religion

In modern Turkey, non-religious people have historically adopted a few approaches to religion:
*   **Dismissal**: "Religious people are not worth talking about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Confrontation**: "Atat√ºrk showed us the right way... these religious people are traitors, we need to crush them, silence them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Ignorance/Indifference**: A continuation of dismissal, exemplified by indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

These approaches leave important aspects of human life under the monopoly of religious people, leading to an inability to offer substantive answers in [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions | discussions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. If religious approaches have political and cultural consequences, it necessitates an intelligent engagement rather than avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### The Speaker's Proposed Approach

The speaker asserts that people representing rational thought do not have the luxury of ignoring or belittling the phenomenon of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Instead, they must understand, embrace, and confront it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The goal is to rationally understand the phenomenon of religion, discuss its boundaries, and determine its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

One proposed method is to establish an institution that brings a rational approach to religion, potentially as a "Faculty of Theology" that differs from traditional vocational high schools focused on religious propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The aim is to engage with religion without causing offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, learning from successful communication strategies like those of the Jesuits, who convey religion indirectly through moral issues and psychological problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

The primary purpose is not to destroy a believer's religiosity, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Instead, it is to reinforce non-religious people or those undecided, which is seen as a more valuable and productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The objective is to surround religion with reason, making reason the referee in the match between reason and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

### Case Study: The Quranic Account of Mary

As an example of engaging with religious texts rationally, the speaker points to inconsistencies in the Quran regarding Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. The Quran refers to Mary, mother of Jesus, as the "daughter of Imran" and "sister of Aaron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This aligns with Moses's sister Mary, whose father was Imran and brother was Aaron, but this Mary lived centuries before Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

A rational interpretation suggests the writer of the Quran likely confused the two Marys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. While alternative hypotheses exist (e.g., another Imran and Harun existed at the time of Jesus), they lack strong evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Given the widespread presence of Jews and Christians in the Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad's time, and his likely illiteracy, it is plausible he gained knowledge of these scriptures by hearsay and inadvertently conflated figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This approach encourages a polite discussion, acknowledging that while rational certainty may be high, a believer might still harbor inner restlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The speaker plans to delve into topics such as the origins of holy books (Torah, Bible, Quran) through philological discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Further discussions will explore the position of religion within Human Rights Law and the limits of freedom of expression in religious matters, referencing European Court of Human Rights decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. The ultimate goal is to understand the current [[the_role_of_religion_in_society | religious position in Turkey]] and how to intelligently engage with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

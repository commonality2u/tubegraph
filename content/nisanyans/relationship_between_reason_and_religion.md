From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Discussions surrounding [[religious_belief_and_rationality | reason and religion]] often evoke strong and negative reactions from two diametrically opposed perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Some question whether reason and language have anything to do with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, while others, rooted in Enlightenment philosophy, question if [[faith_and_rationality | reason and religion]] are opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Claiming that [[religious_belief_and_rationality | reason is independent of religion]] can turn reason into another [[faith_and_rationality | subject of faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Defining Rational Thought and Science

[[religious_belief_and_rationality | Rational thought]] is presented as a specific way of thinking and confronting truth, serving as the basic engine for human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Humanity constantly faces a bombardment of incomprehensible data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. To cope, humans put forth assumptions or hypotheses and then test them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

When a result contrary to an assumption is encountered, the process involves:
*   Initially questioning one's own perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   Next, wondering if the theory is incomplete and seeking to refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Finally, if contradictions persist, acknowledging the theory might be wrong and seeking a more correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

This approach of [[religious_belief_and_rationality | falsifiable]] assumptions is the way of learning and the way of [[religious_belief_and_rationality | science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[religious_belief_and_rationality | feature of science is that it is a method]], and its propositions are [[religious_belief_and_rationality | falsifiable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. A thesis is accepted until a "brighter and more original view" or stronger counter-evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Religion and its Relationship with Reason

In its early stages, [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | religion is scientific in its early stages]], acting as a [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | scientific hypothesis]] to explain incomprehensible events, such as attributing people getting lost in a forest to jinn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Similarly, ancient Greek myths, like the Achaeans winning because Apollo sided with them, functioned as scientific hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

A significant turning point in this evolution is [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | Judaism]], where the [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | God of the Jews plays in this world]] and directly influences history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Over time, the concept of God became [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | increasingly abstract, increasingly loaded with incomprehensible features]], reaching a point where it [[faith_and_rationality | cannot be falsified with any evidence in the real world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

This leads to a fundamental distinction:
*   Jesus, in a biblical account, suggests that belief without empirical evidence (touching his wounds) is more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   This perspective culminates in the idea that if one believes in something with "no rational possibility," they are a "real Christian" or truly religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Trying to explain it scientifically means one is not truly a Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   Faith is defined as accepting propositions that are illogical or beyond falsifiable reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   Ultimately, [[faith_and_rationality | faith and reason cannot meet]] on any common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Challenges and Approaches to Religion in Modern Society

There are multiple views on the relationship between [[religious_belief_and_rationality | reason and religion]]:
*   Confining religiosity to an "island or a ghetto" within rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   Accepting religiosity as a principle and systematically carving out its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Using a [[religious_belief_and_rationality | rational approach]] to historical events within religious frameworks, such as the birth of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that [[role_of_religion_in_modern_society | people continue to believe in religion]], even in environments like the Soviet Union where anti-religious propaganda was compulsory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite scientific advances, the [[role_of_religion_in_modern_society | number of religious people in the world is decreasing despite all the advances in science]] but remains a significant phenomenon that intelligent people must confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is crucial to [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | explain the phenomenon of religion]] seriously and understand its persistent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. [[differences_between_religious_and_secular_individuals_in_society | Ignoring or belittling the phenomenon of religion]] is not an option for those representing rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Critiques of Current Approaches in Turkey
In Turkey, non-religious people often fall into three approaches regarding religion:
1.  Dismissing religious people as not "worth talking about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
2.  Believing that religious people are "traitors" who need to be "crushed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
3.  A continuation of the first, trivializing religion with responses like "we will go to the disco tonight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

These approaches have left [[role_of_religion_in_society | religion]], an important human activity, to the [[differences_between_religious_and_secular_individuals_in_society | monopoly of religious people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. When confronted, non-religious individuals often lack answers because the subjects are monopolized by religious discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. The speaker argues for an "intelligent war" if dissenting opinions on religion are threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### The Aim of Engaging with Religion Rationally
The speaker aims not to [[philosophical_discussions_on_morality_and_belief | destroy the religiosity of a believer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Instead, the primary purpose is to [[differences_between_religious_and_secular_individuals_in_society | reinforce the non-religious people]] and those undecided on faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This means understanding and confronting the phenomenon of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, and discussing its boundaries on a [[religious_belief_and_rationality | rational basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

[[role_of_religion_in_society | Religion is constantly responsible for developing mechanisms to renew and strengthen faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>, implying that people's faith is not as strong as perceived, necessitating constant reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. This also indicates that religion responds to a "real need" that has been diagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## Case Study: Mary in the Quran

To illustrate how to [[religious_belief_and_rationality | embrace religion through reason]], the speaker uses the example of Mary in the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. The Quran mentions Mary as the daughter of Imran and sister of Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. This aligns with Mary, the sister of Moses, from the Torah, whose father was Imran and brother was Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. However, it also identifies her as the mother of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

A rational analysis suggests a high probability that the author of the Quran conflated the two Marys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. While alternative hypotheses (e.g., two Imrans, two Aarons, two Marys) exist, they require strong counter-evidence to be convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Until such evidence is provided, the more likely conclusion from an objective viewpoint is the mix-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

This discussion is grounded in the historical context that in Muhammad's time, the [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | Torah and the Bible were known at least by hearsay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | Muhammad probably did not read either book]] and may have been incapable of doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. The way the word "book" is used in the [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | Quran gives the impression of someone who does not know what a book is]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. It is natural that Muhammad might have made errors based on hearsay, and while later editors of the Quran had opportunities to correct such inconsistencies, they did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

### Moving Forward
The speaker proposes a seminar aiming to develop a [[religious_belief_and_rationality | rational approach to religion]] and potentially establish a permanent institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Key discussion topics include:
*   The [[historical_and_philosophical_perspectives_on_religion | origins of certain holy books]] (Torah, Bible, Quran) and their philological analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   The [[role_of_religion_in_society | position of religion within Human Rights Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.
*   The limits of [[role_of_religion_in_society | freedom of expression in religious matters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>, examining concrete cases and European Court of Human Rights decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
*   The current [[role_of_religion_in_modern_society | religious position in Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

The goal is to [[religious_belief_and_rationality | surround religion with reason]], to make it harmless, and ensure reason acts as the referee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. This requires engaging with the issue without dismissing religion as "worthless nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The current [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia Ukraine conflict]] is characterized not as a war between [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]] and Ukraine, but as a conflict between [[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] and the [[influence_of_western_countries_on_global_conflicts | Western alliance]], specifically [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]], led by the United States and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Western public opinion, particularly in Türkiye and generally in the West, is seen as repeating one-sided propaganda headlines with fierce determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Common propaganda theses include:
*   "Putin must have gone crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Questioning how an independent country can be invaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Condemning bombing and civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The speaker questions the unquestioned perspective that the borders of independent states are inviolable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. There is surprise at how easily the discourse of [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]], an alliance described as the "pioneer and leader and the main actor of all kinds of meanness and dishonesty in the world," is accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While acknowledging the terrible human cost of the war, including deaths, demolished buildings, and hundreds of thousands of refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, the speaker asks how the situation reached this point and whether it began suddenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Historical Context: Post-Soviet Collapse and Western-Russia Relations

Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet Union was liquidated almost completely peacefully, without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The Russian Empire was also liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, with satellite states in Europe, such as East and West Germany, being reunified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The Soviet Union, comprising 15 republics, was dissolved surprisingly quickly and peacefully, an unprecedented historical event for a great world empire to surrender without fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

In the early 1990s, Russian society had a "big dream" and expectation of being accepted and embraced by the West, to be helped in establishing democratic institutions and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Russians saw themselves as a natural part of European culture and civilization, aspiring to a Europe stretching "from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. They hoped Europe would accept them after a difficult period under a "bad administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

This period, from 1991 to 1995, was a "big honeymoon" where [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] even requested to join [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, this expectation was not met. The Western world, particularly Americans and Germans, descended on [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] with "an army of looters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Adventurers, robbers, opportunists, and swindlers sought to exploit [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]'s natural resources, industrial facilities, art collections, and even its women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Some former Communist Party members and those who gained power also participated in this looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, leading Russian society to encounter "the ugly face of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Around 1998, Russian society naturally began to resist this plunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This resistance, often involving violence and the rise of "Russian oligarchs" or "mafias," was met with a "violent reaction" in the Western world, which then labeled [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] as undemocratic and lawless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Western Efforts to Break Up Russia

The speaker contends that American rulers actively sought to destabilize and break up [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]], similar to the dissolution of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The "spark point" for this was Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Islamic militants, trained abroad (especially in Türkiye), were sent to Chechnya to instigate a guerrilla war and independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The hope was that if this succeeded, similar movements would emerge in 41 regions of [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]], including Tatarstan, Crimea, and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

When Vladimir Putin was elected in 2002, his primary duty was to "give a life-or-death struggle" against this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The destruction and calming of Chechnya by 2002 led to the Western world never forgiving Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Similar attempts to start Islamic guerrilla movements in Tajikistan also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Georgia and Ukrainian Integration into NATO

Next, Georgia, a historically problematic country, was encouraged to adopt a fanatic Georgian nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Efforts were made to organize and integrate the Georgian police and army into [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]], including attempts to bring Chechnya into [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] via Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Georgia, which has several other nations living within its borders, then pursued policies of massacre and expulsion against these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] attacked Georgia in response, in a week-long war that left Georgia unable to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

This aggressive policy from America can be pinpointed to the Clinton period after 1995-1996, with the rise of a "political movement" and "bureaucratic movement" in Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This group, including leading theorists who insisted that [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] remained an enemy and that [[historical_politics_and_al liances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] policies should reflect this, gained dominance in American foreign policy from 2000 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. These individuals are described as "sick of power," driven by prejudice and arrogance, and tired of thinking objectively about [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] due to seventy years of anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## NATO's Shifting Purpose and Expansion

[[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] was established in 1949 with the purpose of combating the Soviet Union and limiting its potential hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, when the Warsaw Pact dissolved in 1991, [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] logically had no further reason to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### The Bureaucratic Imperative to Expand

Despite its original purpose becoming obsolete, [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] continued to exist as a massive organization feeding a large staff, a huge arms industry, a propaganda industry, and various research institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The speaker argues that any bureaucratic organization, after its initial purpose is met, develops a "sole purpose" of maintaining its own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Thus, [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] decided to continue, and its definition of an "enemy" slowly shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Waves of NATO Expansion

Starting from 1997 (or 1995), [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] began to expand its area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>:
1.  **German Reunification (1991):** Allowed on the basis of an agreement with [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]], this meant East Germany, a former Soviet satellite, joined West Germany, a [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] consented, seeing no other solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
2.  **Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary (mid-1990s):** These countries joined [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Though it was said they wanted to join the European Union, not [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]], they eventually joined both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
3.  **Baltic Republics (early 2000s):** Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, created by Germany in 1918 as "a spear directly directed at the heart of [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, were accepted into [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. These countries were strategically important, blocking [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]'s access to the Baltic Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
4.  **Bulgaria and Romania:** Also accepted into [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
5.  **Yugoslavia's Successor States:** Yugoslavia was divided, and its parts were added to [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

### The Push for Ukraine in NATO

Since 2008, the idea of including Ukraine in [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] began to be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. When the Ukrainian administration resisted, a coup in 2014 brought a pro-NATO government to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This coup was not a popular uprising, but rather "hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the square" while the vast majority watched on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Ukraine was "seized" with promises of visa-free travel to Europe and benefits of the "world of abundance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

Despite 30% of Ukraine's population being ethnically Russian or Russian-speaking, their demands for autonomy or alliance with [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] were suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Street clashes in Odessa resulted in many deaths, and attempts to protect provinces like Donetsk and Luhansk were met with violent suppression, leading to tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. In recent years, the Western world has continually asserted that Ukraine would join [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] and serve as a military bulwark against [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

## Russia's Stance and Warnings

Since the early 2000s, especially since 2008, [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]'s approach has been clear: Ukraine cannot and will not be included in [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Ukraine is seen as a "part of our historical homeland," with a significant Russian population and its economic and cultural infrastructure integrated with [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] declared it would not hand over Ukraine to a military power that considers [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

Many "sane people" in America and Europe, including George Kennan (the theorist of the Cold War), warned against this expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Kennan, in 1997, called [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]]'s expansion policy towards [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] "suicide," "madness," and "stupidity" that would "lead to war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

Many military, diplomatic, and academic figures echoed these warnings, stating that the policy was "madness and will lead to war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. From a historical perspective, the speaker states that the "person responsible for this war" is the one who "planned this war" and "caused this war knowingly and willingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The argument is that the "threat of violence is as dangerous as violence," cornering [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] to a point where it had to defend itself, often using "ugly methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### Ukrainian Agency and Western Influence

The speaker argues that Ukraine is not an independent state, but a country "seized" by [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] forces, with its institutions and administrative staff financed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Connections between American political figures and Ukrainian administrators are also cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

It is asserted that if Ukraine becomes a weapon against [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] and [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] is "crushed," this would serve Western interests, not necessarily Ukrainian interests, despite the desires of some Ukrainians to join Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. The speaker questions whether the consequences for [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] (a country of 140-240 million people) were explained to Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

The speaker points to [[influence_of_western_countries_on_global_conflicts | Western countries]]' history of bombing independent countries in the last 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, citing examples such as:
*   Serbia in 1998 (to create an independent Kosovo run by "drug trafficking gangs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   Iraq (destroyed in 2002) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   Afghanistan (invaded and destroyed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   Syria, Yemen, and Libya (destroyed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

The speaker concludes that "fighting to prevent them from taking over Ukraine is an honorable act. It should be applauded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

## Future of the Conflict and Germany's Role

The question of whether the [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukraine War]] will be a "Pyrrhic victory" for [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. There is a strong possibility that [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] will suffer very heavy damage, making it a victory with devastating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

Regarding Germany's post-war position and relations with [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]], the expectation is that Western powers, including Germany, do not want to do business with [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]'s current "introverted and nationalist administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. Their aim is to bring down this administration "at all costs and at the cost of destroying [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. After succeeding, they might then seek "good relations" for economic reasons, such as buying gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

This approach is based on underestimating the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. All great wars, including World War II, started with this miscalculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Historical examples of those who tried to easily defeat [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] include Napoleon (1812), the Ottoman Empire (1877), and Hitler (1941), all ending in "great disappointment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. The current war is described as a "gamble" and a "loss shot" with an unpredictable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

### Ukraine and Russia's Military Actions

Overthrowing Zelensky with a coup appears difficult at this stage, as he has shown resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. The speaker believes [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] will ultimately win the war, but the duration and intensity are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] is making a serious effort to prevent civilian harm, at least initially, by targeting military facilities and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. The low number of Ukrainian civilian deaths reported early on suggests it's not a very bloody war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

The West's entire policy, however, is seen as wanting the war to last "as long as possible" and be "as bloody as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. This strategy is believed to have "great value in terms of propaganda" to convince world public opinion that "the Russians are bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. A long-lasting war is also expected to harm [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] economically, diplomatically, and domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

[[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]], especially in recent years, is accused of losing "all kinds of moral concerns," "historical perspectives," and engaging in "unlimited aggression and hurting policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. Their aim in conflicts like Iraq was not military but to "kill as many brown-skinned men as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Germany's Economic Imperialism in Eastern Europe

After 1989-1991, Germany pursued economic dominance across Eastern Europe, from Greece to Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. German companies, investments, cars, supermarkets, and hardware stores took over markets, pouring in money and providing loans to finance German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. This process has reached its limit as loans will likely not be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>, necessitating further expansion.

Germany's options were either to "capture Ukraine" to exploit its resources (wheat, gas, meat, milk, leather) or to "play bigger and take [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. It seems they are now targeting [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] in the hope of a regime change that would turn [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] into a "population area" for German, or perhaps American, benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

## Turkey's Position in the Conflict

The Montreux Agreement's importance in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine War]] is highlighted. The agreement imposes serious restrictions on third countries' warships entering the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] is considered the agreement's biggest defender and beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. If the war escalates and [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] countries are forced to intervene directly, Turkey will face "very heavy pressure" to join the war due to [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. If Turkey resists, it could face severe political and economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

Turkey's recent policy regarding [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] and [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]] is deemed successful, rational, and in the interest of the Turkish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. This policy, likened to İsmet İnönü's approach during World War II and Abdulhamid's traditional foreign policy, involves:
*   Appearing close to the West, taking pictures, and making statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.
*   Talking to the other side, fulfilling some demands, and buying weapons from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

A war can be both a problem and an opportunity. Turkey, as a country in between, could be offered concessions to persuade it to join the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>. This creates a "bargaining opportunity" for Turkey, allowing it to extract benefits from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. For a country without the power to cope with neighbors on its own, being "slippery" is considered the best policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

### Propaganda and Information Warfare

The speaker notes that there is a perception of little resistance in Ukraine and no major losses for [[Russias role in international relations and conflicts | Russia]], urging listeners not to "watch too many [[historical_politics_and_alliances_in_europe_and_their_impact | NATO]] channels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. The West's propaganda power is described as unrivaled in its ability to spread lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. An example cited is the fabricated story of Ukrainian soldiers on an island telling a Russian warship to "go f*** yourself," which was immediately swallowed by millions globally as heroism but was a complete lie; the soldiers actually surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

## Western Democracy and Bureaucracy

The speaker argues that Western countries, despite their appearance, are "extremely organized and extremely captive in the hands of a socratic dictatorship that penetrates every area of ​​life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. A large part of people's lives is spent trying to comply with "meaningless and purposeless rules of a package of bureaucratic cuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. The threat of punishment for wrongdoing is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

In contrast, former Soviet countries have a low probability of punishment, which creates daily difficulties but also offers "bribery" as a "great freedom tool" and a "social mechanism that gives a person a chance to breathe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. The level of "police state and dictatorship" in the West is described as "frightening" and "breathtaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

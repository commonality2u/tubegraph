## The [[russian_military_uprising|Military Uprising in Russia]] (June 2023)

The military uprising in Russia, which captured international attention, began on a Friday evening, prompting many messages to the speaker expressing concern about the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The speaker initially predicted the incident would last 48 hours, a "very pessimistic estimate," but it concluded within 22 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Historically, mercenary uprisings, especially during wartime, are common and 99% are suppressed within 40 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The Wagner Group, involved in this uprising, is described as a force of "20,000-something people prepared for small-scale wars, a guerrilla type," lacking its own air force, logistics, factories, weapons production, or intelligence agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Public and Political Response

Under Putin, Russia has improved significantly from a state where regions were controlled by mafias and young people faced limited options, to a country that is "more successful than it was yesterday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Despite criticisms, the president is generally "accepted and appreciated by society" as a person who "saved the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

In a country with such a consensus, a military commander's challenge to the state in the middle of a war is "strongly rejected and cursed by the overwhelming majority of society and the circles that hold the power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The speaker criticizes the Western press for displaying "such a mess" and "sunk" reporting, lacking "minimum intelligence and knowledge" in their coverage of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The dominant discourse in Western media predicted civil war, prolonged conflict, and an immediate Ukrainian victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Causes and Aftermath of the Uprising

One simple explanation for the uprising is the influence of alcohol, as Russian people "drink a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The Wagner leader, described as an "adventurous man, a thug" who started from scratch selling sausage sandwiches and developed a "very close father-son relationship" with Putin, felt betrayed when the Wagner group was set to be liquidated and connected to the Ministry of Defense by July 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This act is seen as typical "warlord behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, with the leader believing that by going directly to "the boss," he could explain his problem and resolve the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Putin's subsequent appearance on screen was marked by a "very good speech" where he declared the uprising "treason" and stated the perpetrators "will be executed," a shock given the previous lack of direct opposition to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The rebellion's end "resulted in the consolidation and strengthening of the Putin regime in every way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the uprising was allowed to unfold for 24 hours because preventing it would have required "shedding a lot of blood" against "national heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Putin likely anticipated it would resolve itself, viewing the leader as "emotional and a little stupid," expecting him to "calm down tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Comparison to 1917 Kornilov Affair

The speaker draws a comparison to the Kornilov Affair in Russia in July 1917, where General Kornilov moved army units towards Petersburg (then the capital) to "take control of the military administration" amid army dispersion and insubordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Kerensky's government did not allow this, and when a general arrived in Petersburg, he was detained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Vladimir Lenin made a "genius political move" by having the banned Bolshevik Party declare "full support for the timber government" against the military threat, leading to their gain of power and subsequent coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Putin's speech implicitly referenced this incident, signaling that "it will not be like in 1917" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis|Russia-Ukraine Conflict]] Outlook

The speaker reiterates a long-held opinion that "Russia will win the Ukraine war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Initially, there was a belief that Russia would be destroyed by economic measures, but this did not happen; instead, Russia "got stronger in the last year and a half," while Western countries "came to their bankruptcy" due to "incredibly stupid series of policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

Russia's strategy changed after the Istanbul talks were "disrupted by the force of the West," moving from a quick operation to destroy the Ukrainian army and secure neutrality to a decision to "destroy the state called Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This long-term work aims to bring the Ukrainian state to a point where it cannot continue its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The speaker asserts that Western Ukraine's fate is uncertain, but "the middle and East will join Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Ukrainian armies have "collapsed," its industrial and financial infrastructure "destroyed," and a generation of its male population "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. The elimination of the Ukrainian "troublesome regime," which is seen as "like the offspring of Nazism," is considered "a service to humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

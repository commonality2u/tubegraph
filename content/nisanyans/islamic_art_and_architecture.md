## Islamic Art and Architecture

### Islamic Cities: A Cultural Hegemony
[[influence of cultural and religious dynamics in the Middle East | Islamic civilization]] established a distinct [[cultural and societal transformations in the Western and Islamic worlds | cultural hegemony]] across a vast geography, evident in its urban design and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This influence spanned from [[cultural and architectural influences in Marrakech | Marrakech]] in the west to cities like Samarkand and Bukhara in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

#### Defining Elements of Islamic Urbanism
The foundational institution of Islamic cities is the market, characterized by narrow, labyrinthine streets filled with small shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. These markets host numerous tradesmen selling both handicrafts and industrial products, often organized by profession and geographical distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This "great taste" of bazaars is seen consistently in cities like [[cultural and architectural influences in marrakech | Marrakech]], Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Urfa, Mardin, Baghdad, and Iranian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. The indispensable basic institution of Islamic cities is the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

#### Non-Figurative Art
A highly developed feature of Islamic art is its non-figurative style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This art form avoids the depiction of nature and people, instead focusing on the continuous repetition of abstract figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. It is described as a sophisticated, decorative, and colorful art style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This non-figurative art is distinctly Islamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a> and is evident in old palaces, madrasahs, and elite houses in cities like [[cultural and architectural influences in marrakech | Marrakech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

#### The Role of the Mosque
Mosques are fundamental regulators of natural life in Islamic cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. The combination of bazaars, non-figurative art, and mosques creates typical elements found across a vast geography, covering almost one-third of the old world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

### Ottoman Influence and Legacy
The [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Ottoman Empire]] had a distinct architectural and administrative structure compared to other Islamic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. Its core, centered in Istanbul, reflects a different structure that can be attributed to the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Byzantine tradition]] and heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. The political structure in the eastern parts of [[impact_of_architecture_in_anatolia | Anatolia]] historically resembled areas like Morocco, with principalities that sometimes submitted to the central state and sometimes rebelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. In contrast, Western [[impact_of_architecture_in_anatolia | Anatolia]] and Rumelia, being old [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Byzantine lands]], had a different political culture and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.

The Ottomans made efforts to expand their influence into North Africa, capturing the city of Fez twice and most of Morocco during the 16th century, though they could only hold it for about six months during one attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Their motivation was to secure an Atlantic port, as the world's trade axis shifted away from the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Ottoman Empire]]'s formal administrative structure did not extend significantly into areas like Algeria and Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. However, there was a great admiration for the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Ottoman Empire]] and [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | Türkiye]] in the Arab world, viewing [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | Türkiye]] as a "rich relative" and the "whitest Muslim country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. This admiration led to some imitation, such as the 17th-century Alawi dynasty in Morocco imitating Ottoman Janissary armies and using the Turkish title "pasha" for commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>. The Pasha Palace in [[cultural and architectural influences in marrakech | Marrakech]] is an example of this influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.

### Symbolism: Crescent and Star
The crescent and star symbol is a Middle Eastern symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>. According to one theory, it was the sacred symbol of ancient Arab or Assyrian principalities around Harran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. It became widespread in the [[cultural and societal transformations in the Western and Islamic worlds | Islamic world]] after the Abbasids adopted it as a state symbol in the 9th century, placing it on their money and flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>. The symbol was also used in the Roman Empire for a period, again originating from Syria and Harran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>. This symbol has nothing to do with Turkish tradition, but was adopted into [[cultural and societal transformations in the Western and Islamic worlds | Islamic tradition]] from the Abbasid tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>. It represents the dream of a unified, undivided Islamic Empire, which has been a strong idea for 1400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:00">[46:24:00]</a>. Today, the crescent and star are found on the flags of the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Ottoman Empire]], Pakistan, Tunisia, and many Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:13:00">[47:13:00]</a>.

### Aesthetics and Criticism in Public Spaces
The discussion of aesthetics in public spaces, such as municipality halls, can highlight cultural and economic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. The use of gold-leafed seats, for instance, often faces criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>.
One common criticism is of "vulgarity," suggesting that if one has wealth, it should be expressed in a [[modern_architecture_aesthetics | modern Italian style]] rather than a [[contemporary_turkish_politics_and_islamic_influence_in_state_ideology | Neo Ottoman style]] or with gold leaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>. This criticism often stems from a perceived lack of awareness of specific "symbols of distinction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>. However, gold glitter has historically been a symbol of wealth and superiority for average people across various cultures, including the [[historical_perspectives_on_ottoman_and_byzantine_contexts | Ottoman Empire]], India, China, and the West until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>.
Designing public spaces, like a mayor's hall, with impressive elements serves to host guests, businessmen, contractors, and statesmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>. Such displays are a "bargaining move" to project a superior image to those with a certain average public culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.

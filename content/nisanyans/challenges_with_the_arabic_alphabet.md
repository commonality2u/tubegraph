From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The Arabic alphabet presented significant challenges when used for writing Turkish, leading to widespread discussion and reform efforts starting from the 1860s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Most sensible people in Türkiye began to view a writing revolution as a condition for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Difficulties in Transcribing Turkish and Foreign Words

The Arabic alphabet caused serious problems in writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. These issues were perceived as surmountable, similar to how the Latin alphabet also struggles to express all English vowels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

A major challenge arose when trying to write non-native words or foreign words that did not match the sound structure of Turkish and Arabic. The Arabic alphabet led to "absurd results" in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. For instance, deciphering old maps, texts, or tax records written in Arabic script for Turkish place names often makes it impossible to determine pronunciation for more than half of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The inability to distinguish between similar-sounding words like "pürü" or "pürün" highlights this ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

The Latin alphabet, as adopted in Türkiye, is considered much more advanced and suitable for expressing fine details compared to the Arabic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Attempts at Reform

Between 1908 and 1918, during the first Constitutional Era, the Ottoman ruling classes proposed many ideas for reforming the Arabic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. These ideas included:
*   Radically reforming the Arabic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Transforming it into a fully alphabetic script that expressed all vowels and consonants separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   Changing the shapes of Arabic letters to be separate and independent, similar to Latin alphabet characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Influence of Westernization and Other Alphabets

From 1850 onwards, the cultural landscape and horizons of Türkiye's ruling, cultured, and educated classes underwent a complete transformation, with the West becoming their primary reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. New ideas, educational destinations (Geneva, Paris, London), literary forms, clothing fashions, scientific developments, political and legal concepts, journalistic styles, and article writing were all derived from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. In this context, the desire to adopt an alphabet similar to Western ones became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

An additional factor contributing to the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] was the rise of Turkish publications using Armenian and Greek letters starting from the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Numerous Turkish novels, newspapers, and regular publications covering daily news, international affairs, stock market news, jokes, and poems were being produced in these scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

Notably, some Turks, including Muslims, preferred reading these publications over those written in Arabic letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. They even learned the Armenian alphabet to read Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This preference stemmed from the fact that both the Armenian and Greek alphabets were significantly more successful and easier in expressing the nuances of spoken language than the old Arabic script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

The increasing literacy rates in Türkiye presented the possibility of people shifting towards the Armenian and Greek alphabets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Preventing this shift was deemed necessary, and it was understood that this could not be easily achieved with the Arabic alphabet, or would require a massive and difficult education campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

## Debunked Arguments for Alphabet Revolution

Two primary arguments were put forward regarding the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | letter revolution]], which are considered to have no basis:
*   **Increased Literacy**: It was argued that the new alphabet would increase literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, this is not supported by evidence. Many countries using the Arabic alphabet, such as Iran, have high literacy rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. The Arabic alphabet is a foreign alphabet for Persian, incapable of expressing its sounds, yet Iran's literacy rate is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Similarly, in Israel, a systematic education system imposed the Hebrew alphabet (structurally similar to Arabic) on a population that largely didn't know it, leading to a 100% literacy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Therefore, the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | Alphabet Revolution]] in Türkiye is not believed to have significantly contributed to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **Aiding Westernization**: The argument that the alphabet change helped Westernization is also considered "not very true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. However, when a country's cultural structure and orientation change, strong pressure for a change in script is almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

Despite the debunked arguments, the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] is largely seen as an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Military Education and Discipline

The foundation of military education and the military itself is discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Modern armies indispensably require absolute obedience to orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Soldiers as Political Actors

There is significant danger when soldiers attempt to become political actors within a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Such tendencies should be suppressed early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Expulsion of Lieutenants (Turkish Armed Forces)

Recently, lieutenants from the [[turkish_political_landscape_and_elections | Turkish Armed Forces]] were expelled after taking a "pirate oath" and drawing a sword during their graduation ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This act followed their petitions—submitted 8 or 9 times—to read their oath differently, which were consistently rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The individuals knowingly committed this act with the will to disobey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Their dismissal was considered the minimum possible punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

A mass uprising, especially in front of national cameras at a Military Academy graduation, constitutes a crime of rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Historically, the penalty for military uprising across societies and eras has been the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The speaker, who was previously tried for inciting rebellion in the Turkish army, believes these individuals "got off very cheaply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

While showing respect for young people who express their political ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, these individuals "chose the wrong profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Their career termination at an early stage was seen as beneficial for both their personal development and the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. They seemingly lacked the personality traits to adapt to the military profession, and if successful, their attitude could have posed a serious threat to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Historical Political Events

### September 12 Regime and Atatürk Peace Prize

The September 12 regime refers to the military coup in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>. During this period, Nelson Mandela reportedly rejected the Atatürk Peace Prize, stating it would be shameful to accept an award named after a "dictator and General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a>. This rejection was seen as a "slap in the face" to the September 12 regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:58">[01:40:58]</a>. The speaker notes that Kemal Atatürk is not widely seen as a positive figure by progressive elements in the modern world, being primarily known as the leader of a genocidal regime and a dictator who ended democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

### Revolutionary Movements and State Authority

Societies have historically had privileged classes beyond the peasantry: those who hold guns (commanders and the executive body), elders who guide through knowledge, and merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. The state is defined as a "violent organization" that monopolizes the use of violence within certain limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.

The Ottoman Empire encountered armed revolutionary movements first in Macedonia, where groups used terrorist tactics like raiding gendarmerie stations and villages to make the region ungovernable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:20">[01:48:20]</a>. This inspired the formation of the [[political_history_of_turkey | Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) as a secret revolutionary organization, similar in structure to the Bolsheviks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:22">[01:49:22]</a>.

The [[political_history_of_turkey | Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaks) became the almost sole political movement for Armenians in the Ottoman Empire by 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>. Like the CUP, it adopted a secret, cell-type organizational structure and engaged in attacks against security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>. CUP leaders recognized the similarities between their own organization and the Dashnaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>. Talat Pasha, a CUP leader, reportedly believed the Dashnaks were "10 times stronger" than the group that overthrew Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07">[01:51:07]</a>.

The relationship between the CUP and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation saw periods of cooperation and cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>. In 1908, Dashnak candidates were on the CUP's list for the Ottoman Parliament elections, forming a joint parliamentary group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. However, relations began to cool after the Adana events of 1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>, and Armenians left the CUP group in parliament in 1912 to form their own separate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:32">[01:52:32]</a>. Despite this, close contact and communication persisted between leading figures of both groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>.

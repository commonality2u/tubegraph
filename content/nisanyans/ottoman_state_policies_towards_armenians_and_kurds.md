The relationship between Armenians, Kurds, and the Ottoman state is a complex and multifaceted historical issue, particularly concerning the events of 1915.

## Historical Dynamics Before 1915

Before 1915, the "Armenian incident" was not solely confined to that year's events; rather, 1915 is described as the "final blow" or "finishing move" in a century-long process of massacre, expulsion, usurpation, and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Historically, the primary oppressor of Armenians, causing them to flee their homeland, was identified as the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Under the control of Kurdish tribal leaders and later Kurdish sect sheikhs, Kurds were "experts" in killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For a long period, until the last quarter of the 19th century, Armenians consistently preferred to see the Turks, meaning the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Ottoman State]], as their allies and protectors against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It was typical for Armenians to seek refuge with the Ottoman governor against the attacks of a [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish agha]] and find safety through Ottoman assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The 1915 "Annihilation Project"

The events of 1915 are characterized as an "annihilation project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, consciously and cold-bloodedly planned and executed by the Union and Progress administration of the [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey_and_armenia | Turkish state]] and the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Ottoman state]] bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The objective was to "completely cleanse" the "Armenian problem" that had troubled the Ottomans for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In carrying out this project, the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Turkish state]] utilized [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish Bey aghas]] and the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurdish people]] as allies, helpers, and subcontractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an existing tradition of massacre and extortion among Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The state successfully exploited this in the Eastern provinces by essentially giving implicit permission for actions, communicating, "Okay, friends, you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you. Don't worry," and ensuring that those who committed crimes would not be judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Around 1880, a significant hostility emerged specifically towards the Armenian Church, rather than the Armenian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Shifting Kurdish Perspectives

A notable [[change_in_kurdish_perspective_on_armenian_issues | change in Kurdish perspective on Armenian issues]] began to emerge following the depletion of Armenian assets in the Anatolian countryside. After Armenians were no longer present as targets for looting or for their property, or for women to be seized, the [[role_of_kurds_in_the_armenian_genocide | Kurds]] realized their situation and became aware of their direct confrontation with the [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey_and_armenia | Turkish state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

In the last 20 to 30 years, the attitude and approach of the [[turkish_and_kurdish_relations_in_modern_eastern_anatolia | Kurds]] towards the [[history_of_armenian_and_turkish_relations | Armenian issue]] has [[change_in_kurdish_perspective_on_armenian_issues | changed radically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This development is seen as positive, with the hope that Turks will similarly overcome their own prejudices and ignorance and adopt a more open approach like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Armenian Identity and Presence

The speaker's family demonstrates a personal connection to Armenian identity, with his daughter, grandson, and son-in-law (possibly) undergoing baptism and becoming members of the Armenian church in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The baptism ceremony is planned to take place at Etchmiadzin, described as the center of the Armenian religious world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The speaker admits to having previously neglected to baptize his own children, a decision his daughter now considers a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Historically, before 1915, the number of Armenian villages in Anatolia was significantly higher than Greek villages, described as almost ten times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. In the East, unlike the West, Christianity was "never a religion defined by a state," meaning the Armenian population persisted even after the establishment of Muslim rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. By the early 20th century, there were over 2,000 Armenian villages in Eastern Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. All of these were mixed villages, with some Armenians converting to Islam, and others living alongside Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. This mixing was partly due to legal reasons under Islamic law, where non-Muslims required the presence of Muslim individuals for loyalty and service, as only Muslims were allowed to carry weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

## Greek Presence and Islamization

Prior to 1915, Greek villages were primarily found on the coasts of Marmara and the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. The process of Islamization differed between the Greek and Armenian regions of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

In Western Anatolia, excluding coastal areas, the Greek identity's foundation (the Byzantine State and Church) was destroyed. Consequently, between the 14th and 15th centuries, the local Greek populations largely converted to Islam "collectively, completely and almost seamlessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. After the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, Islam became the religion of the succeeding Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

Exceptions to this widespread conversion were Greeks in cities and towns, who maintained their own organizations and social functions, and those involved in fishing and seafaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. This explains the continued existence of Greek villages in areas like the Erdek, Çeşme, and Bodrum Peninsulas, and the Aegean Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. The agricultural population of Anatolia, however, largely became Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

In the 19th century, following Greek independence, a significant number of Greek people migrated from northern Greece and the islands to Anatolia to work as farm laborers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. This led to the establishment of new Greek villages in Western Anatolia, specifically in Manisa, Izmir, Aydin, and Balikesir, which did not exist before the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. Before the 18th and 19th centuries, there were "almost no villager Greeks" in the interior of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

## [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Kurds]] and [[history_and_dynamics_of_turkisharmenian_relations | Armenian Relations]]

A notable shift in the perception of [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Kurds]] by Armenians occurred during the 19th century. At the beginning of the century, [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Kurds]] were largely seen as allies and admired in Armenian national thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>. However, by the second half of the 19th century, [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | Kurds]] became depicted as the "number one object of hatred," characterized by cruelty, injustice, banditry, and brutality in Armenian literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

The **Gulo lament**, also known as "Gülizar's Bloody Wedding," tells the story of Gülizar, an Armenian woman kidnapped from the Hars village of Muş in 1889 by Musa Bey, chief of the Hevidi tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. This incident became a significant scandal during the Armenian national awakening, generating extensive discourse, articles, novels, poems, epics, and laments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. Gülizar was eventually rescued through the intervention of the Ottoman government and Abdülhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. She later married a Dashnak militant and actively participated in the Armenian national cause until her old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Musa Bey was exiled but later pardoned, reportedly playing a role in the Hamidiye regiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.

## Slavs and the Blond Element in Turkey

The Slavic invasion of Eastern Europe in the 6th century, originating from modern-day Belarus, significantly impacted the demographics of the Balkans, including areas that would later become part of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. Slavs spread south, invading regions like Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and parts of Greece, where they established their own kingdoms for approximately 500 years before gradually coming under Byzantine and then Ottoman rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the most important source of the blond element in Greece is likely the Slavs, who had settlements across Greece during the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. During the Ottoman period, a significant portion (though not the majority) of Slavs, including Bulgarians, Pomaks (a type of Bulgarian), Bosnians, and Albanians, converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Within the Ottoman class hierarchy, Turkish-speaking Muslims held higher status. Peasants, upon moving to cities, would first live in Bulgarian or Pomak Muslim neighborhoods before attempting to have their children learn Turkish and attend Turkish schools to gain better positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. Consequently, a substantial part of the Rumelian Turks (Turks from the Balkans) are descendants of Slavic or Albanian Muslims, contributing to the "blond vein" in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.

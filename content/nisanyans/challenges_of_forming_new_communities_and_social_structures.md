Forming new communities and social structures presents complex challenges, particularly in the modern era where traditional abilities for community-building have been significantly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. Historically, establishing settlements and congregations was considered a natural human activity, akin to eating and drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. However, contemporary society, especially urban environments, has lost the collective knowledge and skills necessary for this endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## Core Principles for Community Formation

When considering the establishment of a new community, several fundamental principles should guide the process:

*   **Avoid "Cleansing"**: The initial advice is to never attempt to "cleanse" a community by excluding certain groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Such an approach inevitably leads to "evil" and [[social_decay_and_violence_in_society | social decay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. A healthy community can embrace diversity, including individuals who are black, working class, or Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on establishing clear rules, defining [[power_dynamics_and_social_organization | power dynamics]], and creating a functional organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Group Effort**: Establishing a community is a collective endeavor that cannot be undertaken by an individual alone; it requires a cohesive group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Highest Human Activity**: Establishing a congregation or settlement is arguably the most valuable and self-developing activity in human life, even more so than forming a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Community Building

Two primary issues must be addressed within any group attempting to form a new community:

### 1. Managing Malfunctioning Individuals
Communities must establish effective mechanisms for dealing with individuals who "malfunction," such as those who become alcoholic, upset, or engage in theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. The objective is not necessarily to punish but to prevent and minimize potential damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **Social Control and Alcohol**: As an example of social control, it's suggested that individuals should be forbidden from drinking alcohol alone, as this can lead to asocial behavior and societal disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Conversely, it is recommended that the community come together once a week to drink wine, beer, or raki communally, as a "good society" requires members who know how to socialize and, if necessary, get drunk together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>.

### 2. Ensuring Education
As communities grow, with new members being born, a robust system for education is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

## Broader Societal Context

The ability to form healthy communities is also influenced by wider societal conditions:

*   **Erosion of Institutions**: Globally, there is a widespread erosion of traditional institutional roles and functions, including the judicial system and constitutional courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. This is not limited to one country but is observed in many nations, signaling a bankruptcy of institutional models worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>. This institutional decay can contribute to difficulties in establishing new, stable social structures.
*   **Impact of Propaganda and Consumerism**: Societies heavily exposed to advertising and propaganda can lose their "sanity," making it difficult for individuals to think healthily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. Advertising is described as "the art of lying while looking into one's eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:28">[01:31:28]</a>, leading to a society that struggles to perceive truth and believes the world is a "public relations exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53">[01:31:53]</a>. Such conditions hinder the ability to form genuine and functional communities.
*   **Need for Systemic Shock**: Without experiencing a major military defeat or economic disaster, there is little possibility for significant positive change or a return to "sanity" in societies heavily impacted by these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

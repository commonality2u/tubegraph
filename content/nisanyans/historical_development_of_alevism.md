The historical development of [[introduction_to_alevism|Alevism]] can be understood as a complex and eclectic movement with roots in various traditions, ultimately solidifying as a distinct identity in opposition to the dominant Sunni Islamic ideology of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

## Origins and Crystallization

The "Alevism event," as understood today, largely crystallized between the 1400s and 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This period saw the rise of the Safavid dynasty in Ardabil, Iran, starting with figures like Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and Shah Ismail across three generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. This marked a significant revolutionary and protest movement against classical Sunni Islam, functioning as a religious reform movement that coincided with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

While this movement dramatically intensified in the 15th and 16th centuries, it had earlier roots. No revolutionary movement starts from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Earlier rebellions in Anatolia, such as the Father Ishak and Father Ilyas rebellions in the 1200s, along with various movements like Hurufism and Batinism, contributed to a history of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## Ottoman Persecution and Suppression

The Safavid-backed movement grew to threaten the very existence of the Ottoman Empire during the reigns of Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Beyazıt II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. It was brutally suppressed under Yavuz Selim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

The Ottomans viewed this movement as an ideological "deadly danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. For centuries, the Ottoman state ruthlessly suppressed Alevism, crushing it, exiling followers to mountains, and executing those deemed illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This persecution continued, with a violent suppression of Alevis and Bektashis during the disbandment of the Janissary Corps in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Consequently, Alevis maintained poor relations with the state, often living illegally, fleeing to remote areas, and hiding their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

## Core Identity and Beliefs

The primary characteristic of [[introduction_to_alevism|Alevism]] is its resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law (Sharia), and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Alevis reject many fundamental practices of classical Islam, such as prescribed fasting, Sharia rules, pilgrimage (Hajj), and almsgiving (Zakat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. Despite these rejections, they define themselves as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

Alevis trace their lineage to Ali, considering him the rightful successor to Muhammad and rejecting the first four caliphs except Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. They recognize the 12 Imams, starting with Ali's sons Hasan and Husayn, as the true representatives of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. However, [[introduction_to_alevism|Alevism]] in Turkey developed a distinct tradition separate from Iranian Shiism, which has a strong academic and hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Turkish Alevism lacks a central organization, relying instead on "dedes" who continue local shamanic and spiritual traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.

## Diverse Influences and [[cultural_and_ethnic_diversity_within_the_alevi_community|Cultural and Ethnic Diversity]]

[[introduction_to_alevism|Alevism]] is an eclectic movement, bringing together various elements that were at odds with mainstream Islam for different reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>. Its influences include:
*   **Turkmen and Turkish Tribes**: Many Turkish and Turkmen tribes in Anatolia, who were only "half Muslims" or in a "slippery position between Islam and other options," joined the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Approximately half of Alevis in Turkey today identify as Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   **Kurdish Population**: A significant portion of the Alevi population, roughly 40%, is of Kurdish origin, especially west of the Euphrates in regions like Malatya, Sivas, Tunceli, and Erzincan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Christian Traditions**: Alevism shows strong effects of Christianity, with Ali being a figure similar to Jesus and ceremonies resembling Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Islamic Middle Eastern Traditions**: Arab Alevis (Nusayris) in Antakya and Hatay follow a distinct tradition with different temples and forms of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Their traditions resemble pre-Islamic Middle Eastern practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Local Anatolian Traditions**: Inferences suggest a continuity between Alevism and earlier separatist religious movements in Anatolia, such as the Paulicians (Pavlusculuk) of the Byzantine era, particularly in the Sivas-Malatya-Tokat triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.
*   **Balkan Alevis**: Alevism is also found in Albania and Bulgaria, particularly in the southern part of Albania (Orthodox region) and the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. These communities also represent a form of "not fully Muslim" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Groups**:
    *   **Tahtacıs**: Forest dwellers primarily in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, distinct from other Yörük groups, often having a nomadic lifestyle and traditionally involved in logging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>. They are less connected to leftism and more likely to vote for MHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Abdals**: Found in Central Anatolia, especially south of Gaziantep, they are often involved in music and entertainment as a professional social group, sometimes associated with Romani people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. Figures like Neşet Ertaş are Abdals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.

## [[alevis_connection_to_kemalism_in_trkiye|Alevis Connection to Kemalism in Türkiye]]

For centuries, the fundamental defining element of [[introduction_to_alevism|Alevi]] identity has been their opposition to Sunni Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. The Ottoman state and its dominant ideology consistently presented Alevis as "infidels" if they did not conform to Sunni practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>.

With the advent of the Turkish Republic and the secularist reforms of Ataturk, Alevis found an ideological ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. Kemalism, which promoted secularism, offered Alevis for the first time a sense of belonging and the possibility of participating in state institutions without having to conform to Sunni norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>. They saw Kemalism as a means to assert their rights within the state and counteract the dominant Sunni ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>.

## Social Integration and Challenges

Historically, Alevis have sought political platforms to secure their rights. In the 1960s, some engaged with moderate right-wing politics, while in the 1970s, many shifted towards the socialist left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. The revolutionary youth movements of the 1970s were overwhelmingly composed of Alevi individuals, deeply influencing the culture of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. This led to elements of [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities|Alevi culture]], such as the bağlama (saz) and folk songs, becoming symbols of the Turkish left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. The anti-religious stance of the Turkish left is also seen as a reflection of this Alevi influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

Despite their alliance with Kemalism, the speaker notes that this path might be a "dead end" for Alevis, as Kemalist politics often remains a minority force in a predominantly Sunni-majority Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. The Turkish state has historically been successful in assimilating diverse groups over generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>. However, the familial upbringing within Alevi communities, often characterized by a skepticism towards official narratives, has contributed to a resilient identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

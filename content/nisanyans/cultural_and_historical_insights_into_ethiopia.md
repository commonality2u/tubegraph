Ethiopia is a country divided into two distinct regions in terms of tourism: the North and the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>.

## Northern Ethiopia
The northern region of Ethiopia is characterized by magnificent monasteries from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. It is home to an original Christian culture, distinct from Western Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">[02:58:33]</a>. The speaker had previously [[travel_experiences_in_montenegro_and_ethiopia | traveled]] extensively in the North and even stayed in one of these monasteries for a few days, describing it as a "great experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:11">[03:08:11]</a>. However, travel to many parts of the North is currently difficult due to closed roads and an ongoing civil war, making air travel necessary for accessible areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Geographically and culturally, northern Ethiopia is considered a continuation of the Middle East, bearing traces and ruins of Mediterranean culture, past states, and empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:16">[04:02:16]</a>. It is relatively dry and shares physical geographical aspects with Turkey, Anatolia, Syria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:44">[04:28:44]</a>.

## Southern Ethiopia
In contrast, Southern Ethiopia is seen as "Africa of Africa," representing a large part of the African continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:20">[05:06:20]</a>. This region is where some of the oldest African cultures have survived largely unspoiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:24">[05:20:24]</a>. The speaker describes the South as a "fantastic country" and a "dream trip" since a 2008 tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:47">[03:41:47]</a>.

Historically, a significant portion of the African continent, roughly 45 out of 50 states, shares a common cultural integrity dating back to the Bantu migrations in the 10th century Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>. The South of Ethiopia and the North of Kenya are considered a core part of this shared African identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Tour to Ethiopia
An [[upcoming_trip_to_ethiopia_and_broadcasting_challenges | Ethiopia tour announcement]] is planned for the first or second week of March, lasting 14-15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The idea for this trip originated from Onur, a friend in the group who owns a detergent factory in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. Details, prices, and an application form for the tour are expected to be ready within a week or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

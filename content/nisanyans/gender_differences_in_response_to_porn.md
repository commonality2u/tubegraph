From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker suggests that significant gender differences exist in the way individuals respond to pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Male Response

According to the speaker's observations, the entire male population on Earth, without exception, shares a similar opinion regarding porn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is asserted that a man who genuinely dislikes porn has not been encountered, and such a claim would be disbelieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Men are described as being "all affected by well made porn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Female Response

Women are described as having a "very different psychology," which is harder to understand regarding visual stimulation compared to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The speaker's subjective observations suggest that a percentage of women (115% is stated, likely an emphatic expression) might "like to look at" porn even if not directly interested in it, while others do not like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This observation is noted as subjective and not scientific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Historical Context

The speaker acknowledges the long history of sexually attractive female figures being produced and valued, dating back to Ancient Greece and earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The word "pornography" itself is derived from Ancient Greek, where "porn" means "purchased with money" or "commercial commodity," highlighting its historical connection to transactional services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This linguistic origin underscores the idea that [[comparison_of_porn_and_prostitution_with_historical_trade_like_salt|pornography and prostitution]] were among the first areas where monetary exchange was applied in human history, alongside the [[comparison_of_porn_and_prostitution_with_historical_trade_like_salt|salt trade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Societal Impact

The speaker was asked to address the significant size of the [[impact_of_the_porn_industry_on_society|porn industry]] and its effects on societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, noting the USA as a leader in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Despite questions about whether porn is harmful, beneficial, halal, or exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the speaker personally supports it and does not find reasons to oppose the [[economic_aspects_of_the_porn_industry_and_its_history|porn industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The speaker also expressed a belief that women participating in the [[economic_aspects_of_the_porn_industry_and_its_history|porn industry]] are not necessarily doing so under conditions of tyranny or exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

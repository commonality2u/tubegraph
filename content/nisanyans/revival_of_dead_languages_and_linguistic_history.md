## Linguistic Connections and Skepticism

A question was raised regarding 20-30-40 Basque words that share significant similarities with Armenian words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. The speaker, however, dismisses such claims if one possesses a basic understanding of linguistic literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This skepticism is likened to disbelieving in jinns despite empirical evidence presented by believers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

The Basque language, spoken in northern Spain and France on the Atlantic coast, is considered strange because it is not a single language and has no relation to any known European language; its origins have been debated for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Various theories attempt to link it, with the strongest and most commonly heard theories suggesting connections to Sumerian and Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>, and others claiming common features with Georgian, Armenian, Siberian, and Etruscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

However, an experienced linguist can easily identify that lists of common words often contain errors, distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>, misreadings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>, printing errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>, or include words that couldn't have been common at the time of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Through this method, common word lists can be artificially created between any two languages, from Philippine to Chinese, or Australian native languages to Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. The belief in ethnic ties, such as between Sumerian and Turkish, is equated to those who believe in jinns, driven by a strong desire to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. A theory suggesting a relationship between Basque and Armenian pearls was put forward in the 1890s but was later concluded to be untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. To this day, no convincing genetic connection has been determined between Basque and any other language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

## History of the Turkish Language

The speaker intends to write a book about the [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_anatolia | historical development of Turkish]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, a project that was shelved but may be revisited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Turkish is considered one of the world's top 20 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a> and has been an imperial language for 1300 years, influencing a vast geography, especially felt in places like Serbia and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

The history of the Turkish language is deemed too valuable to be left to "Turkish fanatics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>. Since the early 20th century, governing cadres in Turkey have made efforts to reduce Turkish to a "tribal language" or "clan language," perceiving it as belonging to Stone Age tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. However, Turkish has always been an imperial language, a language of science and administration, similar to Latin, Greek, Arabic, and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. More than half of its speakers are non-native, using it as a second language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. It was shaped as an imperial language and functioned as the common language for Armenians, Arabs, Kurds, Iranians, and Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

The speaker believes that documenting the history of the Turkish language is a significant contribution to Turkey's cultural formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Revival of Dead Languages

The discussion turns to whether a language with no speakers can become a living language again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

*   **Hebrew**: Is presented as a prime example. It was considered dead for centuries, known only to scholars from books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. Through a systematic campaign, it was revived as the common language for Jews in Palestine at the beginning of the 20th century, built from scratch with influence from the language of the Torah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. After two generations, the nation in Israel speaks Hebrew fluently, producing literature and films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   **Welsh**: The Welsh language, spoken in the Wales region of England, was largely dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. Starting in the 1980s, it was revived through state policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. It is simple to revive a language if taught in primary schools, as children will learn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Irish**: In contrast, when Ireland gained independence in 1920, attempts were made to revive the Irish language, making it an official state language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. However, 99% of Irish people still speak English, and the revival effort was largely unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

[!INFO]+ Key Takeaway on Language Revival
Reviving a dead language appears possible with strong political will and systematic educational implementation, as seen with Hebrew and Welsh. However, success is not guaranteed, as demonstrated by the case of Irish.

## Future of Novel Writing and Social Commentary

The discussion shifts to the future of novel writing and its role in reflecting society, particularly in the context of political power and social change. A good novel needs to delve into all layers of social life and understand different classes and cultures with depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:44">[02:26:44]</a>.

In Turkey, there is a disconnect between the educated middle class (who write novels) and the classes with real power, creating a "wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>. This makes it difficult to write a novel that can understand various societal figures—from ordinary Muslims to intellectuals, civil servants, presidents, or police chiefs—with the same depth and human feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>.

Turkey has experienced tremendously dramatic changes in the last 20 years, with every level of society undergoing "great earthquakes" that are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. There is a need for a novel about this period, one that explores the state of mind of those making dramatic decisions and how other classes were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>.

Two periods in Turkish history are particularly fruitful for such analysis: the 1920s-30s and the Tayyip Erdoğan era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. A true "Atatürk novel" has not yet been written, nor a brave novel about the current era, exploring the inner lives of the head of state and his circle, as well as their impact on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. Such a writer would need to intimately know dominant structures, big businessmen, mafias, ordinary people, and even prison life, understanding their inner faces through familial and kinship relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:42">[01:36:42]</a>.

The ability to write such a novel requires both deep love for people and a certain level of hatred to maintain distance and critically examine diverse human types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>. However, modern Turkish series, despite their global popularity, are criticized for their superficiality, lack of human feeling, and clichéd, homogenous characters drawn mainly from the Istanbul middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>. The speaker suggests that the "golden age of literature" might be over, as people are losing the habit of reading long texts, and the dominant medium of expression is now television series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>.

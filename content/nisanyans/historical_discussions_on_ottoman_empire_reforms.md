## The Tanzimat Era and Modernization Efforts

The period of Abdülaziz's reign, specifically from 1861 to 1876, witnessed an unparalleled [[ottoman_empires_modernization_and_westernization | modernization and westernization]] movement within the [[Historical analysis of the Ottoman Empire and its decline | Ottoman Empire]], often referred to as the "glorious days of Tanzimat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. During this time, significant administrative and social changes occurred:
*   For the first time in [[Historical Perspectives on Ottoman and Byzantine Contexts | Ottoman history]], non-Muslims were able to hold positions as ministers, officers, and managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   The empire experienced tremendous breakthroughs in literature, painting, military organization, [[state_power_and_modernization_efforts_in_the_ottoman_and_republican_periods | state organization]], and the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
*   These reform efforts, led by figures such as Ali Pasha and Kececizade Fuat Pasha, were considered to overshadow later reforms of the Atatürk period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   Sultan Abdülaziz, despite being considered old-fashioned, allowed these teams to govern the country, often in close cooperation with the French and British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

In the final five years of his reign, after 1871, Abdülaziz attempted to become more involved in politics as state finances neared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. His interventions were largely unsuccessful, leading the country to the brink of collapse before he retreated, allowing the old Tanzimat cadre to return to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

## Attempts at Constitutional Monarchy

A key demand during this period was the declaration of a constitution and a shift to a constitutional monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. Abdülaziz resisted this, fearing it would lead to the country's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. Ultimately, he was found dead with his wrists cut, a death described as a murder disguised as suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

The Armenian nation, an important element of the [[Historical Perspectives on Ottoman and Byzantine Contexts | Ottoman Empire]], had been granted a constitution and law by the Sultan in 1861, leading to the establishment of an Armenian National Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. This assembly formed factions and parties and largely managed the administration of the Armenian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. From the early 1870s, this administrative board took "radical, very serious, very forward-looking steps," including gathering statistics on Armenian society throughout the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. This parliament was seen as a test bed for an [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman constitutional monarchy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. The tremendous economic, cultural, and educational development within Armenian society fostered the belief that a parliament would bring similar prosperity to the Muslim people of the [[Historical analysis of the Ottoman Empire and its decline | Ottoman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

### Sultan Murat V's Brief Reign and Dethronement

With the overthrow of Abdülaziz, his nephew, Sultan Murat V (son of Abdulmecid, not Abdulaziz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>), ascended the throne in 1876 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. Murat V was known for his modernist European mentality, a close friend of progressive cadres, and even a Mason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. The expectation was that his rule would accelerate reforms and lead to a constitutional monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

However, a series of terrible events followed:
*   The murder of Abdülaziz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   Circassian Hasan, a loyal servant of Abdülaziz, raided a cabinet meeting, killing the Minister of War, Hüseyin Avni Pasha (the head of the junta that overthrew Abdülaziz), and other ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. Circassian Hasan was subsequently tried and executed in Beyazit Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

These events reportedly caused Sultan Murat V to lose his mind, entering a deep panic and psychopathological state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. After deciding not to sign the constitutional reform, he was dethroned three months later based on a doctor's report declaring him mentally unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## Abdulhamid II and the Constitutional Law

Sultan Abdulhamid II, Murat V's brother, was then placed on the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. Initially, Abdulhamid resisted enacting the Constitutional Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. However, under pressure from Mithat Pasha, who threatened to declare a Republic, Abdulhamid signed the Constitutional Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.

Before signing, Abdulhamid added Article 111, which granted the Sultan the authority to exile individuals inside or outside the country without a court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. This insertion effectively undermined the law, which remained in force for only about 1.5 years before Abdulhamid shelved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

Mithat Pasha, who was Grand Vizier when the law was declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, was later forced to resign, exiled, and eventually lured back to Istanbul under false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. He was then subjected to a "show trial" known as the Yıldız Court, a "shameful source of [[turkish_historical_events | Türkiye's modern history]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Mithat Pasha was sentenced to death for his role in the overthrow of Abdülaziz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. Abdulhamid, known for not approving executions, commuted the sentence to exile in a fortress in Taif, Arabia, where Mithat Pasha and another Pasha died in a dungeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

## Societal Structure and Modernization Challenges

The speaker draws a comparison between the historical societal structure of the [[Historical Perspectives on Ottoman and Byzantine Contexts | Ottoman Empire]] and contemporary Israel, noting a persistent issue where a ruling class differs in religion and affiliation from a lower class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Before the 19th century, [[social_and_economic_changes_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman society]] had Muslim rulers and non-Muslims who were deprived of citizenship rights and treated as "second-class citizens and humiliated dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. The question is posed whether such an order is sustainable in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

The speaker notes that the [[cultural_and_educational_aspects_of_the_ottoman_ruling_class | Turkification of Arabs]] was a very rare assimilation event in [[Historical analysis of the Ottoman Empire and its decline | Ottoman history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

The ongoing events in Ukraine prompt a closer look at its cultural fabric and the historical influence of [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]]. An analysis of Emmanuel Todun's book, "Deet Deoksidan," offers striking observations regarding Ukraine's cultural landscape.

## Historical Russian Cultural Dominance in Ukraine

Until approximately five to ten years ago, Ukrainian high culture was almost entirely built upon the Russian language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This extensive influence extended to various foundational aspects of Ukrainian intellectual life:
*   **Academia and Literature** Good writers, scientists, and the main pillars of university education were largely ethnic Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These individuals often hailed from the Eastern part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Language** Even for non-ethnic Russians, the common language used in high culture was Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Ukrainian cinema and scientific literature were completely embedded in Russian culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Language Status** Historically, the Ukrainian language was primarily spoken by the peasantry in the country's Western regions, existing as a variant rather than a language of high culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

For approximately 200 years, [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] has been one of the world's leading cultural languages, boasting a tremendous body of literature, some of which was produced by Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In contrast, the Ukrainian language possesses little in the way of high culture, beyond some folk poets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Current Cultural Shifts and Consequences

The deepening and increasingly radical cultural shifts in Ukraine are seen as effectively leading to the destruction of its high culture and intellectual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This situation has rendered Ukraine culturally "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This deliberate dismantling of its cultural heritage is described as "conscious cultural suicide" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The phenomenon is not unique to Ukraine, as similar trends can be observed in other post-Soviet countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent nationalist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, where everything cultural began to be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications and the [[western_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine War]] Architect

The analysis extends to the geopolitical dimensions, particularly concerning the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine War]]. Victoria Nuland's resignation from her high-ranking position within the U.S. State Department was considered one of the most striking global news stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. She is identified as the main architect of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

In 2014, a "masterfully planned and skillfully staged coup" occurred in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This modern-style coup, distinct from traditional military coups, involved the domination of bureaucratic structures, propaganda tools, and street and secret organizations working in concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

The sequence of events leading to the coup included:
*   **Color Revolution** A democracy movement, partially based on justified reasons, was provoked, organized, and supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **EU Association Agreement** When a trade agreement with the European Union was on the agenda, a street movement emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Violence and Overthrow** Demonstrations escalated, with unidentified individuals opening fire on crowds, leading to hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Armed groups seized key locations, raided the Ukrainian parliament, and threatened deputies, forcing the elected president to resign and flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Victoria Nuland was the organizer of this coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, which marked the beginning of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Prior to this, she was a leader in selling the Iraq War to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Her resignation, especially in an election year, suggests that "something is going very radically wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It indicates that Western decision-makers have realized the [[implications_of_the_ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine War]] is lost and its consequences will be severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This realization has led to increasing panic and confused attacks within Western leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Statements by figures like Macron, threatening world war, and disagreements within military echelons, are seen as reactions to the impending loss of the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_global_politics | Ukraine War]] and its dire consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Nuland's resignation is viewed as a positive development, with hope for accountability for those responsible for such conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

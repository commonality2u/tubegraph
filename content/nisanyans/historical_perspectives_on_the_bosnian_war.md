Bosnia is described as an interesting and strange country, particularly in terms of its politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Geographically, it is mountainous and beautiful, characterized by a green countryside with small, intertwined cities and towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Its population has historically lived in close proximity, with Muslim and Serbian villages and towns often adjacent to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## The Bosnian War: A Multifaceted Tragedy

The country experienced a terrible civil war, involving widespread [[historical_perspectives_on_ethnic_cleansing | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Muslim Bosnians were expelled from approximately half of Bosnia purely due to their ethnic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This expulsion involved creating terror, with threats of violence and rape, to force people to leave their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Such acts are characterized as [[political_and_historical_implications_of_genocide_denial | genocide]] in the classical sense, representing "a manifestation of the will to destroy a nation altogether" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Although mutually bloody events occurred, the Bosnian side ultimately suffered more and lost more of its homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Underlying Historical Tensions

The conflict's roots are deeper than simple attribution to figures like Milosevic and "Serbian fascists," who are often solely blamed for planning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The region has a "500-year-old memory of conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. During the Ottoman period, the ruling classes, including Pashas, Beys, landowners, and educated city dwellers, were primarily Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The Serbian and Croat populations, in contrast, were often serfs or land slaves under Muslim command, leading to constant rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It was only under Austro-Hungarian rule and then in [[Yugoslavias Political History | Yugoslavia]] that they achieved a form of equal citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Serbs, in particular, gained majority status within a Serb-dominated system in [[Yugoslavias Political History | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This historical context meant they were unlikely to accept an independent Bosnian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### The Question of Independence

The declaration of independence by Bosnia is questioned as a "madness" and a "radical crime against humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. At the time, Bosnians constituted 44% of the population, Serbs 33%, and Croats made up the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A political movement led by Alija Izetbegović equated Bosnian national identity with Islam, seeking an independent Bosnia governed by Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Serbs and Croats naturally rejected this, stating they did not want such an independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The argument is made that independence should not be declared based on the will of only 44% of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. It suggests that a status should have been defined to protect the rights and defense mechanisms of minorities, or that the country should have been divided, allocating cantons and regions to different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The demand for a united, independent Bosnia tied to Islam is labeled "a madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

### External Influence and the Outbreak of War

The speaker argues that the European Union and NATO strongly encouraged Bosnia to declare independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This declaration was against the constitution, as it required a two-thirds majority for amendment, which the proponents of independence did not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Despite a referendum, Serbs and Croats boycotted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

The European Union proposed a solution involving 15 cantons with internal administration given to different groups (Bosnians, Muslims, Croats) and a mechanism for mutual sharing of rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. All three parties signed this agreement in March 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, just 10 days later, Alija Izetbegović withdrew his signature after a meeting at the American embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The war broke out two days after this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### War and Post-War Reality

The war's objective for one side was to prevent Muslims from living in regions they considered their own (about half the country), largely achieved through terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The conflict lasted three to four years, devastating the country, ruining lives, and causing civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Ultimately, under American imposition, a peace agreement led to the current state where [[bosnia_and_herzegovinas_political_landscape | Bosnia and Herzegovina]] exists as ostensibly "one and a whole" republic, but with "half of this republic belong[ing] to the only ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. As a result, there are effectively two states within [[bosnia_and_herzegovinas_political_landscape | Bosnia and Herzegovina]], marked by an invisible border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Cities are divided; for instance, a town might have a Muslim majority but its municipality building and mosque are in the Serbian section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

The current situation is deemed "not a sustainable situation" and "no structure that serves peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Election posters highlight the stark divide, with "Serbian homeland, nation, hype" on one side and "Bosnia and Herzegovina flag" on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This ongoing state is considered "another crime against humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Reflections on the Conflict

Visitors are encouraged to explore both sides of Bosnia, including the "sweet" Muslim-dominated Sarajevo and the "much more scary," or rather "sad," Serbian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The recommendation is to understand the psychology of the people on both sides, to question the pain expressed by monuments to martyrs, and to determine if that pain is genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The speaker urges a critical examination of responsibility, asking whether Milosevic was inherently a "bastard" or if he became one due to anticipating "the other side's bastardy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

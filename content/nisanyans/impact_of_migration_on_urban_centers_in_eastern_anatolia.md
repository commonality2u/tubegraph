The study of [[historical_settlement_structures_in_eastern_anatolia | settlement structures]] in Eastern Anatolia reveals significant [[ethnic_and_cultural_changes_in_eastern_anatolia_over_time | ethnic and cultural changes]] over time, particularly influenced by various migration patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A bilingual book, "Turkey east of Ankara," published in 2006, serves as a comprehensive travel book exploring Eastern Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The author conducted six years of extensive research, visiting numerous places like Arda, Hakkari, Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and northern Van, engaging with villagers, cultural figures, and local authorities to understand the region's complex dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Historical Urban Demographics

Historically, until the early 20th century, major cities in Eastern Anatolia, such as Van, were primarily populated by Turkish-speaking individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In the 1910s, there was no significant Kurdish presence in the city center of Van <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Diyarbakır's center had a mix of Turkish and Kurdish speakers, with the prominent families being Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This pattern was common across the Ottoman Empire: the ruling class, regardless of their varied origins (e.g., [[albanian_immigration_patterns_in_turkey | Albanian]], Circassian, Dagestani, Georgian), tended to become Turkish-speaking upon urban migration, education, or integration into the state apparatus, thereby becoming part of [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | Turkish society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The ruling class in cities like Mardin was Christian and Arabic-speaking, with many Turkish families having Armenian ancestry, indicating deep intermarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Non-Muslims, particularly Armenians and Assyrians, were crucial for urban services and cosmopolitan culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For instance, Van's population at the turn of the 20th century was about half Turkish, and Diyarbakır was more than half governed by Turks, alongside significant Armenian and Assyrian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Post-Ottoman Transformations and Decline

The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had an unexpected negative impact on the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became uninhabitable, lacking essential services such as dentists, tailors, or insurance companies, as the cosmopolitan and economically vital Armenian group disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

During the early Republic period, the Turkish-speaking elite in these cities diminished, sending their children to study in Ankara or Istanbul, who rarely returned to their hometowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This brain drain contributed to the gradual collapse and decay of these cities until the 1960s, a period described as the "Stone Age" or "Middle Ages" for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Mid-20th Century [[Mass Migration and Its Societal Impact | Mass Migration]] and "Kurdishization"

From the 1960s, economic development spurred massive [[turkish_peasantry_and_urbanization | migration from villages to cities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Paradoxically, at this time, the cities in the region gradually became Turkified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. However, this trend eventually reversed.

By the 1970s and 1980s, when the author first visited Mardin, there was no trace of Kurds in the city center, which remained Arab and Arabic-speaking, in sharp contrast to the surrounding rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. City residents initially resisted selling property to Kurds, causing Kızıltepe, 20 kilometers away, to swell into a larger, predominantly Kurdish city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Today, however, Kurds constitute the numerical majority in Mardin's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Diyarbakır is now nearly 80-90% Kurdish, and Van is overwhelmingly Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The "greatest success" of the Republican regime in Eastern Turkey has been the complete "Kurdishization" of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While Kurds were a significant population element before, they were largely confined to rural areas in terms of social power and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Today, they are a nearly homogeneous majority in their own region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## [[Political and Social Implications of Ethnic Shifts in Turkey | Social Demands]] and Future Outlook

This demographic shift has created social demands that are deemed "impossible to prevent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Kurdish, while not officially recognized as a primary language, is taught in schools, spoken on the streets, and has become the dominant language in government offices and media in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. With a population of nearly 20 million, the overwhelming majority of whom speak Kurdish with pride, attempts to suppress the language are futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

For anyone familiar with the region, it is an "indisputable fact" that everyone living or wishing to live there, including Turks, will need to learn Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Delaying this recognition will only lead to further problems and potential instability, as a homogeneous population of 20 million with its own language and burgeoning intellectual class cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

While an independent Kurdish state may be challenging to establish due to international conjuncture and Turkey's superior military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, external powers like Russia and Syria might benefit from any weakening of Turkey's control in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Critiques of Philosophy Education

Mücahit Bilici initiated a discussion regarding whether [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] is merely the history of [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. If [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] is considered the sum of ideas that have emerged, then it is indeed only the history of [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. In cultures and among individuals who are drawn to the "apparent charm" of [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] without genuinely understanding thought, [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] is often perceived solely as its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. This perspective reduces [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] to a "prestigious conversation of the elite," a "deep conversation" that ultimately amounts to "gossip and rumor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Societies that adopt this understanding cannot produce [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]]; they only become consumers of existing [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophical]] thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

The critique extends to [[modern_academic_issues_and_education_critique | philosophy education]] in universities worldwide, including in Turkey, where 99.9% of programs are said to suffer from this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. [[modern_academic_issues_and_education_critique | Philosophy education]] often comprises discussions of "labels" and "slogans," with students merely repeating what one philosopher said versus another within "ready-made patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. This approach is characterized as "primitive," "meaningless," and a "show-off effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## The Essence of Philosophy

Despite the criticisms, the speaker insists that [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] is intrinsically linked to its history, though not in a narrow sense of simply reading and memorizing texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | Philosophy]] is defined as a specific set of questions that originated in ancient Greek and Mediterranean culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. These questions have been continuously debated for 2400 to 2500 years, largely within similar conceptual frameworks, with truly new ideas being "extremely limited and few in number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

To engage in [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]], one must understand these recurring themes and debate topics, which deepen and widen within a continuous tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Attempting to do [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] in an abstract sense, as a universal "research into the realities of the universe and man," is likened to making "cheap poetry" rather than genuine [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophical]] inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | Philosophy]] is not a universal discipline of [[philosophy_of_rational_thought_versus_faith | reason and logic]], but rather a specific cultural product and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. It developed from Greek to Roman (Neo-Hellenistic, particularly in Eastern provinces like Egypt and Syria), continued through Arab scholars, and then through Scholasticism in Europe from the 13th to 12th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. It spread to royal palaces and aristocratic halls in the 17th century before returning to universities in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

The essence of [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophy]] lies in questions such as "what is the essence of reality," "what does knowledge mean," and "how is true knowledge separated from false knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. For 2500 years, philosophers have built upon each other's work, responding to texts and creating a body of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Assimilating this work and then producing original or cliché responses constitutes the core of [[philosophy_of_science_and_its_functions | philosophical]] practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

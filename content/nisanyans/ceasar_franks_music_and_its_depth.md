CÃ©sar Franck is described as a surprisingly good "feeder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While he is not usually considered in the "first league" of composers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, his chamber music, piano works, and organ works reveal a surprising depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. He is also noted as a composer who possesses a classical discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

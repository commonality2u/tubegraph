From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The concept of [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] is often misunderstood, particularly when it's asserted that it is an illusion. This perspective is prevalent in certain scientific circles, which argue that human actions are predetermined by external forces or internal algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This view, ironically, aligns at a certain point with those who believe in strict divine determinism, where "God directs everything" and "fate determines it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. However, this speaker believes both these perspectives are incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

## Defining Free Will

A common misconception is that [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] refers to one's ability to direct, organize, or manage their life and actions within a framework of principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. This is, however, not the true meaning of [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Instead, [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] means the "freedom of will" or simply "will" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

### Free Will as a Subjective Feeling
The essence of [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] is the subjective feeling that one *can* choose between different actions or even choose to do nothing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. This feeling, whether it's deciding to go to the kitchen or changing the course of history, is fundamental to human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. All individuals possess this subjective feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Free Will and Consciousness
The speaker posits that [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] and [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] are synonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | Consciousness]] is defined as the feeling of being a subject who decides their own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. To deny [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] is therefore to deny [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] itself, which is considered a foundational concept underlying human experience and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

Some argue that [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] might be an illusion or a "biological malfunction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. This perspective suggests that if everything in the universe is determined—like billiard balls hitting each other—then [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] would be a "strange window" or an error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

## Free Will Across Living Beings
The concept of [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] is not exclusive to humans; it is a common feature of all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. A fundamental distinction inherent in human [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] is the division of the world into living and inanimate objects, a distinction recognized by human babies from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>.

> A kitten, unlike a ball, possesses [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. The kitten perceives itself with a [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]], allowing it to choose various actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>.

The scope of [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | freedom]] and the range of possible actions vary significantly among living beings: very limited for a jellyfish, more for a kitten, and much wider for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Ultimately, [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] is what is common to jellyfish and humans, and what is absent in Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. There is a "difference of degree" in [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] between humans and other animals, but a "difference of kind" between humans and Artificial Intelligence, as they are fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

## Limits of Human Understanding
While disciplines like psychology, sociology, economy, and history often explain human actions as being directed by forces independent of human [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, they struggle to explain the basic psychological reality of human beings and the phenomenon of [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. If all actions are the result of objective forces, then there is no principal difference between a kitten and a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the human mind is "unable to grasp the phenomenon called [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. The concepts of "self," [[philosophy_understanding_its_role_and_questions | consciousness]], and [[the_concept_and_evolution_of_freedom | free will]] are considered equivalent and beyond full human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

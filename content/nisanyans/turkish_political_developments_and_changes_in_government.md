From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Recent events, including the President's coronation ceremony and subsequent ministerial appointments, have brought significant [[political_changes_in_turkey | changes]] to the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These developments are largely viewed as positive, especially the removal of figures like Süleyman Soylu and other "gangster-looking men" from the previous government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The new government is seen as having fewer individuals driven by ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, with many appointments appearing to be "sane Effendi classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The number and quality of foreign heads of state attending the coronation ceremony are seen as a sign that [[development_and_changes_in_modern_Turkey | Turkey]] is on the right path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Reactions and Election Analysis

Sharing positive views on these changes on social media provoked strong reactions from those still in "shock of defeat" from the recent elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The recent election is considered a turning point for [[turkish_political_landscape_and_election_analysis | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, despite a large segment of the population struggling to accept the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The election results signify a "rout" that must be confronted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The political style and methods used previously have been deemed ineffective for the future, necessitating changes in ideas and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Critique of the Opposition
The opposition has been described as a "treason network" due to its "incompetence and incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Skepticism exists regarding the likelihood of a serious democratic election in [[turkish_political_landscape_and_upcoming_elections | Turkey]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The recent election is characterized as the "liquidation of the opposition," with the Republican People's Party, Izmir opposition, and Kurdish opposition being "knocked out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This signals a shift towards more collected, rational, and less belligerent policies, indicating a period of "bureaucratic administration above politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Key Appointments and Global Context

The new cabinet's appointments have sent an unexpected message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs
The appointment of Hakan Fidan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is seen as a correct step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Running a state, especially in an unstable environment like [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Turkey]], is a "dirty business," and individuals in such roles are unlikely to have clean hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The alternative candidates would likely be "dirtier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Some express strong dismay at the appointment of the new Foreign Minister, citing claims of "massacre" and responsibility for the deaths of relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. However, it's noted that individuals managing army, intelligence, and police organizations typically "have blood on their hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

### Vice Presidency
The Vice Presidency appointment came as a "great surprise," as it is an important, non-bogus position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The cabinet now reportedly contains two potential future presidential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. These individuals are perceived as rational, well-educated, and free from ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Ministry of Internal Affairs
The new Minister of Internal Affairs, a former governor, is considered the "most awesome they can find" despite potential past controversial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Global Geopolitical Shifts
There is a significant and rapid change in global power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. New economic systems and military alliances are forming across Europe, Africa, East Asia, and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The fact that leaders from "extreme left regimes" (from Venezuela to Armenia) and those countering "American imperialism" congratulated Tayyip Erdoğan does not inherently validate his actions but suggests that Turkey's opposition needs to re-evaluate its stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Recent historic developments include Syria's re-admission to the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> and the formation of a joint naval force by Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE, and other Gulf countries, replacing previous American dominance in Persian Gulf maritime security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Decisions to create a new currency and payment unit, along with nearly 50 countries applying to join the BRICS group, signify a major global transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### Turkey's Role in New Global Order
For [[political_developments_in_Turkey_and_global_geopolitics | Turkey]] to secure its place in this emerging world order, it faces a difficult step: withdrawing its military forces from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This requires a comprehensive agreement, including aspects related to Rojava, mutual compensations, population exchange, and migration, potentially involving Turkey and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Meetings in Moscow indicate progress on this matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Turkey cannot unilaterally challenge Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and Russia, especially with shaky relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Withdrawal from Syria also necessitates a comprehensive solution to the Kurdish issue within [[turkish_political_landscape_and_election_analysis | Turkey]], possibly including Azerbaijan and Armenia as part of a broader peace agreement with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. The Ankara visit by Armenia's head of state is seen as an important event, suggesting significant behind-the-scenes developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Political Style and Leadership
Contrary to expectations of a harsher, more oppressive period after the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, the absolute defeat of the opposition means there is "no need to get tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. The opposition, including the Republican People's Party and HDP, has been "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

The President's speeches are often read from a teleprompter, where he performs as a "very successful actor" with "terrific diction" and "eloquence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. However, when speaking impromptu, his coherence significantly declines, indicating he does not compose these texts himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

It is advised not to react emotionally to politicians' actions but to analyze their motivations and calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. Assuming a politician is sane, one should question "Why did he speak like that? What is he trying to do?" to gain more satisfying and logical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### Gender in Politics
The new cabinet has only one woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, though a woman is expected to be appointed head of the Central Bank for the first time in [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkey's]] history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. The speaker criticizes the global trend of appointing women to high political positions as a "condition of modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>, noting that many such figures (e.g., Germany's Foreign Minister, Finland's Prime Minister) are "stupid," "incompetent," and "indifferent," with their actions bordering on "treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

It is questioned why competent women do not rise in world politics, with Angela Merkel being the last remembered example of a normal, intelligent woman in a high position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. The current trend is seen as similar to promoting senile old men or "beautiful women who do not have any intellectual capacity and administrative skills" merely for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This "selling images" indicates that actual governance is not the primary function of these figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Historical Political Figures

### Bülent Ecevit
Bülent Ecevit was seen as a "great hope" for a generation between 1971 and 1977, promising to rebuild politics on a moral basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. He was known for his eloquence and ability to use language effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. However, upon coming to power, he proved to be a "terribly incompetent politician" and manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. His first coalition was deemed "absurd," and his second government in 1977 led to the country's ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

Ecevit failed to prevent chaos in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a> and his attempt to create a new political movement based on his charisma outside the Republican People's Party failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. His final prime ministry in 1999 was also a "disaster," characterized by a failure to form a competent team and ideological instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. His career is seen as eliminating the chance for an intellectual revolutionary to lead [[turkish_politics_and_elections | Turkish politics]] for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

### Josip Broz Tito
Josip Broz Tito is described as both a "dictator who established a terrible police state" and "someone who is trying to keep a country that is impossible to govern together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. Yugoslavia was a "great experiment" that "should have been sustained" but could only be held together by tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The country was eventually torn apart by interventions from the United States, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. Despite Tito's own culpability in its destruction, many older people in [[political_and_economic_challenges_in_Turkeys_history | Turkey]] remember him with "mercy and love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:59">[01:34:59]</a>.

### Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is acknowledged for reading more books than any contemporary politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>. This was common for the administrative cadres of the early 20th century who received an elite, Western-based education from limited schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. While well-read in Turkish publications of his time, claims of his extensive reading in French are weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

His intellectual depth is often exaggerated by Kemal worshipers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. As a military leader and "action man," he lacked the critical capacity to seriously evaluate absurd theories like the Mu Continent story or the Sun Language Theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. His concentration of absolute power led him to disregard the opinions of those around him, ultimately leading to self-destruction through absurd theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

## Historical Incidents in Turkey

### The Menemen Incident
The Menemen incident, involving the killing of young officer Kubilay, is viewed not as an isolated act by "bigots and stupid" people, but as an explosion resulting from the suppression, silencing, and insult of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. The question to ask is "Why did they come to the point of cutting off the head?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. While modernization and rationalization may have required oppression, there's a management problem where hurting people leads to consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. The core issue is preventing such rebellions, which only occur when people have "strong reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

### Armenian Genocide and German Involvement
German officers did not actively participate in the planning or implementation of the Armenian genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. However, Germany and [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | Turkey]] were completely intertwined militarily during World War I, with Germany providing financial, technological, and material support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Therefore, the Germans were "completely involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. They either approved of the actions or were indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

During the war, [[turkish_politics_during_and_after_world_war_ii | Turkey's]] biggest fear was an Allied landing on its Mediterranean and Aegean coasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Talat Pasha reportedly threatened that if such a landing occurred, all foreigners in the country would be arrested and Armenians slaughtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. This "ruthless logic of war" is documented by the American Ambassador Morgen Tavuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. Germany's involvement stemmed from the calculation that such an event would irreparably damage [[political_and_economic_challenges_in_Turkeys_history | Turkey's]] relations with the Allied countries, serving Germany's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

## Urban Planning and Zoning
A rumor suggests zoning authority may be transferred from municipalities to the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. Municipalities having manufacturing authority has led to "disastrous results," contributing to the destruction of cities and their transformation into uninhabitable places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. However, centralizing this authority might not make much difference, as the center would still need to establish local units, such as Zoning Commissions, to manage licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

## Cultural Heritage
Efforts to repatriate historical artifacts smuggled out of [[development_and_changes_in_modern_Turkey | Turkey]] are criticized as "banditry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. It is argued that [[development_and_changes_in_modern_Turkey | Turkey]] has recklessly destroyed its pre-Islamic cultural heritage for centuries, viewing it as "enemy remnant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. Therefore, [[development_and_changes_in_modern_Turkey | Turkey]] has "no right" to these artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

The speaker believes that Westerners discovered, valued, and preserved these works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, making it justified for them to be taken. For instance, the Pergamon Altar would have been destroyed if it had remained in its original location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Since [[development_and_changes_in_modern_Turkey | Turkey]] has historically failed to protect humanity's common property, it has lost all rights over these artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. The efforts to reclaim them are seen as "shamelessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.

The "Sunday chats" program marked its 200th episode, a milestone the speaker noted with disbelief at how quickly time has passed and the volume of words produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Origin and Longevity
The program began as a platform that was so well-received, with much praise, that the decision was made to continue it for "one more week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This weekly extension turned into a habit, leading to its current longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The series started in November 2019, meaning the speaker has been in front of the audience every Sunday for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Diyarbakır Cap Anecdote
For the 200th episode, the speaker appeared wearing a Diyarbakır cap, a gift from friends in Diyarbakır <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He noted the cap was a bit small for his head, leading to a humorous observation about proper measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. An attempt to enlarge it by opening stitches proved difficult, prompting a call to the master craftsman in Diyarbakır, who responded politely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The speaker eventually removed the cap as it made his head sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He also shared an anecdote about a Diyarbakır shalwar he owned in Şirince and a cellabiye bought in Egypt, which he enjoyed wearing widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He recounted wearing the cellabiye to a stylish hotel breakfast buffet in Hurghada, which drew astonished looks as it made him appear "one of the working class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Related Endeavors: Turning Conversations into Books
The speaker also mentioned that selected texts from the "market conversations" (another term for "Sunday chats") are compiled into books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. So far, four volumes have been released, with at least one more planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>. These books, titled "Sevan Nişanyan market conversations," are available in bookstores and online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.

The Covid-19 incident is identified as one of three major global crises experienced in the five years leading up to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The speaker was in Canada when the pandemic "broke out" around January 29 or 30, 2020, and notes that the first Covid case in the Western world was detected there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

## Declaration of Fraud

From the very first day it became a headline, the speaker "strongly believed that this business is a big fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This opinion, expressed on every occasion, has "completely proven right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

### Reasons for Skepticism
The speaker offers several reasons for his early and consistent conviction that the pandemic was a "huge fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>:
*   **Propaganda Campaigns** As someone who has followed the Western press for 60 years, the speaker claims to know "very well how such propaganda campaigns are set up" and could "smell it immediately" as a "conscious set up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. The news, originating from a common point, lacked factual basis and aimed to "create panic in society and impose a certain point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **Systematic Preparation** For several years prior, there had been "systematic pandemic propaganda, pandemic preparation," indicating that the pandemic was "consciously organized as a social project" by the powers governing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Unverifiable Statements** The statements from "so-called expert cadres" were described as "superficial" and "impossible to verify through logic or empirical experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. All information was, "without exception, lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

### Evolution of the "Fraud"
The speaker suggests the event was "initially designed as a biological warfare rehearsal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. However, the "pandemic theater" subsequently "turned into an orgy of bureaucracies that were extremely powerful and largely disconnected from reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, becoming a "Bureaucratic Enthusiasm ceremony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

> "People have become so used to those in positions of authority speaking lies that everyone automatically started to lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
>
> "Especially the Doctors spoke a lot of lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

### The Vaccine
Regarding the vaccine, the speaker is uncertain whether it was a genuine scientific development or a "fraud scheme made directly to earn a few hundred billion dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. He speculates there might have been a real scientific study, based on assumptions about mRNA platforms as a "new hope for humanity," but concluded it "turned out completely [to fail]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. However, it was also "used as a tool for a terrifying fund transfer," leading to individuals and institutions becoming rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

### Validation of Critique
The speaker expresses satisfaction that his perspectives, defended since 2020, have been "completely proven right from A to Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a> and are now "shared and delivered by everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

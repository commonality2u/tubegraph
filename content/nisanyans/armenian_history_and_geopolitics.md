Armenia and its geopolitical standing are discussed, alongside internal Armenian politics and its relations with other global powers.

## Personal Context
The speaker, an [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] citizen, spent time in [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] to obtain a new passport after being robbed in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This visit provided an opportunity to engage more closely with [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] politics and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Pashinyan's Reconciliation Efforts
The speaker addresses claims in the Turkish press that [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan denied the [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is dismissed as "absurd news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, given that it would be akin to denying the existence of the American continent or tomorrow's sunrise for an [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] Prime Minister to deny such a fundamental historical fact, known personally by families and through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Pashinyan would have to lose his mind to make such a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Pashinyan's statements were described as "very intelligent" and "proper words" that carried "a real hope of reconciliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Two key points he made were:
*   There is "no need to dwell on the [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] case for more than 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   It would be beneficial for [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]] to "put the needle on ourselves" and "think about what were the mistakes and errors of the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

These statements are not a denial but an attempt to discuss the [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] "in a healthy and more rational way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, aiming for reconciliation with [[TurkeyArmenia relations and economy | Turkey]] and [[the_armenianazerbaijani_conflict and nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This is being undertaken as the leader of a country defeated in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, and it is unclear to what extent he sees reciprocal goodwill from the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Western Influence and Armenian Identity
Part of this reconciliation effort appears to involve appeasing Western circles (United States, NATO, European Union) and making concessions to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The speaker argues that Western states, particularly the U.S. since 1975, have consistently "kept the issue of [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] alive," fanning the flame and reducing [[Armenian history and heritage in Turkey | Armenian national assets]] to "[[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] commemoration and [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] lamentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This has created a "constant hostile environment" between Turks and [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, while simultaneously encouraging the view that the [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide | genocide]] is the most important issue in the world's history and the "only cause of [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians']] national existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Conversely, the U.S. has also encouraged [[History and dynamics of TurkishArmenian relations | Turkey]]'s "immoral denial attitude," particularly through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff since 1974 or 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The speaker notes that until 1973-74, Western press portrayed [[History and dynamics of TurkishArmenian relations | Turkey]] positively, but after 1974, it began to be depicted as a "wild and evil barbaric country that has committed the greatest crimes in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This organized and fake nature of both narratives reveals much about current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Pashinyan's reconciliation efforts are contrasted with the "screams rising from the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] circles centered in California, New York, Washington" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The speaker expresses anger and confusion over the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] government's "flattering signals" to the West, such as the Prime Minister's wife visiting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This is seen as a "diplomatic obligation" to protect [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] from "sabotage from the West," as the West has little military to offer a weak country like [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## NGO Influence in Armenia and Georgia
Both [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] and Georgia exhibit an "incredible NGO inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. NGOs, once seen as tools for democratic initiatives in the 1980s and 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, have in the 2000s been "completely taken over" by Western intelligence organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. These organizations, numbering in the hundreds or thousands, are financed by the European Union, NATO, and the United States, with unclear financing and purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This financial power makes democratic processes impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Georgia's attempt to require foreign-funded NGOs to register as foreign agents was met with an "out of control" reaction from Western countries, especially the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Hypothetical Future of Turkish-Armenian Border
A thought experiment poses the question of what would happen if the [[TurkeyArmenia relations and economy | Armenian-Turkish border]] were to open, and a million people from [[TurkeyArmenia relations and economy | Turkey]] moved to [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] and sought to change its name or political future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. This raises a dilemma about the rights of native populations versus those who settle later, challenging traditional models of colonialism and anti-colonialism, especially in the context of changing demographics in Europe and [[TurkeyArmenia relations and economy | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

## Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict
The [[the_armenianazerbaijani_conflict and nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] issue is cited as another example of conflict over territory. [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] had "legitimate reasons" for its claims, as the region's population had been "overwhelmingly [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Despite the local [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] population not wanting to be under Azeri rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>, and [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] taking over the area, it could not be annexed due to the post-1945 international order that made forced annexation an international crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. For 30 years, [[the_armenianazerbaijani_conflict and nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] remained a "foster homeland" under [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] rule, a separate political unit, rather than becoming part of [[Armenian history and relations | Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This situation, described as a "disgraceful story" and "complete disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>, eventually led to its loss because "it was not possible to change the borders in the international system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

## Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul
The establishment of the [[Armenian history in Istanbul | Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul]] by Fatih Sultan Mehmet is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>. Historically, the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] Church leadership (Catholicosate) fell into chaos after Byzantines exiled the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] Patriarch Gatos Gatos in 1045 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. For 400 years, various rival patriarchates emerged across different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. In 1444, a church council in Sis (Kozan) attempted to unite the church under a single Catholicos, whose seat was moved to the Etchmiadzin Monastery near present-day Yerevan, under the protection of the Akkoyunlu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>. This was a significant geopolitical event, as [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]] represented the majority population and strongest economic element east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>.

However, this unity was short-lived. Two years later, the Mamluks encouraged a rival Catholicos in Kozan, creating two [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] religious leaders: one for the Akkoyunlu and one for the Mamluks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>. The Ottomans, not yet having crossed the Euphrates, had a relatively small [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>, though [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]] were important in certain arts and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>.

When Fatih Sultan Mehmet prepared for the Otluk Beli War, around 1461, he recognized the need for an [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] patriarch in [[Armenian history in Istanbul | Istanbul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>. He called upon the religious leader of the [[Armenian history and heritage in Turkey | Armenian]] masters in Bursa and appointed him as the [[Armenian history in Istanbul | Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:44">[01:33:44]</a>. This move was an "international policy move," primarily serving the Ottoman long-term function of "divide and rule" by playing the [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] patriarch against the Greek patriarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>. At that time, [[Armenian history and relations | Armenians]] were a very small minority in the Ottoman state compared to the Greek Orthodox population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>; their significant numbers in the Ottoman state would only come after the conquests of the east following Otluk Beli and Çaldıran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. There was no one in [[Armenian history in Istanbul | Istanbul]] to make a Patriarch, so Fatih Sultan Mehmet "imported a man from Bursa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>.

Addressing listeners from [[political_and_social_impressions_of_moscow | Moscow]], the speaker notes being in a state of "cultural bombardment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is contrasted with places like Montenegro, which is described as a "Sahara Desert in terms of culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Museums

[[political_and_social_impressions_of_moscow | Moscow]] is highlighted for its extensive museum scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The city boasts 650 museums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Even the "most fake ones" leave visitors amazed and provide ample learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The speaker describes living in a "strange cultural bombardment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, noting that museums cover a wide range of subjects, not just old classical things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Significant investment has gone into equipping and maintaining these institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | Classical Music and Opera]]

The speaker, who considers music an important part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, observed a vibrant [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | music]] scene. At the Tchaikovsky Complex alone, there were 11 concerts and a conference concert on a Saturday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This complex is just one of many [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | classical music]] venues in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. On an average day, there are likely more than 20 [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | classical music]] concerts in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This quantity and quality are believed to be unmatched in any city in [[comparative_evaluation_of_western_and_russian_societies | Western Europe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The speaker also attended an [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | opera]] described as a "masterpiece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Despite having visited most major [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | opera]] stages globally, such as Paris, New York, Berlin, and London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, the speaker had not seen such a high-quality production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These performances are typically "jam-packed" during the week and full on weekends, with a high-quality audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa Opera

The specific [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | opera]] attended was Tchaikovsky's *Mazeppa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. While the [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | opera]]'s music and story were not particularly favored by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, the production itself was magnificent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The staging, soloists, cast, and coordination were described as a "great work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, comparable to "Hollywood Wonders" in cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

The subject of *Mazeppa* is based on a poem by Pushkin, which in turn is based on an 18th-century historical event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Mazeppa, the leader of the Zapor Cossacks (in modern-day Ukraine), was a force within the Russian State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a> who collaborated with the Swedish king Charles XII, suffering a defeat at the Battle of Poltava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Staging such a subject at the Bolshoi Theater, a state-controlled venue, during wartime is seen as a "big political event" with a serious political message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

Notably, the character Mazeppa in Tchaikovsky's [[classical_music_and_opera_scene_in_moscow | opera]] and Pushkin's poem is presented as a complex figure, not merely a villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. He is portrayed with a love story and forced betrayal due to arrogance and lust for power, embodying a "real human tragedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. The play avoids black-and-white morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. The ultimate punishment for betraying the Russian state is seen as "breaking the heart of the woman he loves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

The decision of a country to produce a state-sponsored show about shared history with an enemy during wartime, depicting the enemy not as a "vile dog but as a real person and a person in love," is considered to be "another level" of cultural maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. This is compared to Aeschylus's *Persians*, an ancient Greek tragedy staged in Athens in 470 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Despite fighting a terrible war against the Persians 10 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>, Aeschylus, who himself fought and was wounded in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, depicted the Persian defeat from the perspective of the Persian king's wife and daughter, focusing on their fears, sadness, and disappointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This act represents a "completely different perspective" and "high culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

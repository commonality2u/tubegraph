Understanding [[fatih_sultan_mehmets_intellectual_reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet's intellectual reputation]], culture, and omniscience is challenging due to the nature of historical sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Old histories, including those of the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, China, and India, often feature stereotyped sentences and eulogies about rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This applies to Roman emperors, Byzantine emperors, and Abbasid caliphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. In medieval Turkish states, sultans were often portrayed either as examples or as bad figures, depending on the author's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Ottoman Sources

Very little detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet comes from Turkish Ottoman sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
Notable Ottoman historical works include:
*   Asikpaşazade's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   A history of Fatih Sultan Mehmet written shortly after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A history of houses from the 1860s and 1870s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   An 18th-century work, possibly from the 1460s (towards the end of the Fatih Age), produced as a work of the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman dynasty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

These are considered official histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, the attitude of Turkish historians within these official histories towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet is described as "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Towards the end of his rule, Fatih Sultan Mehmet was not a beloved Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>; he was identified with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He particularly targeted the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, crushing them, seizing their power and property, and executing many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. His 30-year reign was characterized by constant warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, with a new war declared almost every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Byzantine Sources and [[perspectives_from_byzantine_historians_on_fatih_sultan_mehmet | Byzantine Historians]]

More detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet comes from [[perspectives_from_byzantine_historians_on_fatih_sultan_mehmet | Byzantine historians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The two main sources are Halkondylis and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Both lived during Fatih Sultan Mehmet's time, met him personally, and were aware of the situation in his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Agendas and [[the_political_and_diplomatic_context_of_fatih_sultan_mehmets_reign | Political Context]]

These Byzantine accounts, while offering praise, also had political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. They were likely influenced by the complex political and diplomatic realities of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Ottoman Empire was not the only state; it had intense relations with various Italian states, including Genoa and Venice, which were often at war with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Historians with close ties to these Italian states might have sought to defend Italian interests, establish alliances, or foster rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This period was marked by the most complicated world politics, with the Greeks still present in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Clichés and Praises

[[perspectives_from_byzantine_historians_on_fatih_sultan_mehmet | Byzantine historians]] often used cliché expressions to describe Fatih Sultan Mehmet, portraying him as similar to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, claims that he knew Latin and Italian or was aware of Christianity are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A good historian's reaction to such statements is not to question their truth, but to ask *why* they were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Challenges in [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Historical Assessment]]

It is difficult to be certain about the accuracy of statements made about sultans and state administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Whether accounts are favorable or critical, historians must question the motives behind such portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Words about sultans tend to be cliché, ready-made expressions, whether in praise or condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Examples include statements about a ruler's religiosity (e.g., "very religious, even though it is said that he is not religious, I have personally seen that he prays to God in secret") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, or claims about artistic talent (e.g., "he is a poet, and he also made the architectural drawings of all his big projects") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. These are often quoted sentences whose truth cannot be verified without direct interaction with the ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Information and vocabulary concerning state rulers are often disseminated through "buffets" (controlled or curated narratives), making it extremely difficult to trace their accuracy five centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Obtaining an objective, realistic picture from historical literature about heads of state remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

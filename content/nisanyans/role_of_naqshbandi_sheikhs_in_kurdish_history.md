The **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi sheikhs]]** played a significant role in shaping the social and political landscape of the Kurdish regions, particularly from the late 19th century through the early Republic era in Turkey. Their rise filled a power vacuum created by the decline of traditional Kurdish principalities and was significantly influenced by the Ottoman central government's policies.

## Background: Kurdish Principalities and Ottoman Centralization

From the 16th century to the first quarter of the 19th century, the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, specifically east of the Euphrates, were largely governed by [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] principalities (beyliks) [00:32:15]. These entities, such as Hakkari, Botan (in Cizre), Bitlis, Çemişgezek, Hizan, Silvan, and Doğubeyazit, functioned as de facto independent states [00:32:50]. They inherited power, collected their own taxes, and maintained their own armies, largely autonomous in internal affairs despite theoretically paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire [00:33:05]-[00:33:57]. Ottoman pashas in major cities like Erzurum, Diyarbekir, and Van often struggled to enforce central authority over these resilient beyliks [00:34:12]-[00:34:46].

Under Mahmud I, a systematic campaign was launched to dismantle these principalities, concluding around 1841 with the submission of the Hakkari bey [00:34:54]-[00:35:10]. This effort aimed to establish direct central state authority, implementing governors and mutasarrıfs to collect taxes directly [00:35:18]-[00:35:33]. However, this centralization initially plunged the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] geography into a period of significant chaos and anarchy, particularly from the 1850s to the 1870s [00:35:41]-[00:35:53]. During this tumultuous time, various local populations, including [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Armenians]] who constituted about one-third of the region's populace, began to look towards Russia for intervention and stability [00:36:14]-[00:36:35].

## Rise of Naqshbandi Influence

Into this vacuum, an unexpected development occurred: a series of [[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Kurdish]] religious students of the Baghdad Naqshbandi saint Mevlana Halid began to establish their increasing sovereignty across the region [00:36:53]-[00:37:05]. Prominent figures included Sheikh Ali Set in Palu, Sheikh Sibghatullah Arvasi in Hizan, and Taha Ari in Semdinli [00:37:11]-[00:37:24]. They began spreading their influence as a network of **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi sheikhs]]** around the 1860s and 1870s [00:37:35]-[00:37:41].

Sultan Abdulhamid actively supported these **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi lodges]]** as a means for the Ottoman state to re-establish and maintain its sovereignty in the challenging eastern provinces [00:38:00]-[00:38:10]. These lodges, often led by powerful families, expanded their control over the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] geography through generations [00:38:29]-[00:38:44]. A notable aspect of their rise was their acquisition of properties from churches and monasteries, which significantly boosted their economic power [00:38:44]-[00:38:54].

Interestingly, a significant portion of [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Armenian]] villagers supported this new phenomenon of **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi sheikhs]]** over the traditional authority of churches and monasteries [00:39:05]-[00:39:14]. Many converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to these [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] sheikhs [00:39:17]-[00:39:22]. This transformation was particularly clear and intense in Hizan, where the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Armenian]] population dramatically decreased from 80-90% to 20% by the end of the 19th century [00:39:51]-[00:39:54]. Similar changes were observed in Mutki and Gürün, indicating a significant breakdown of [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Armenian]] societal structures and the establishment of a new **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi]]**-supported authority [01:00:04]-[01:00:12].

## The [[sheikh_said_rebellion_in_turkish_history | Sheikh Said Rebellion]] and the Republic

[[sheikh_said_rebellion_in_turkish_history | Sheikh Said]], a central figure in [[sheikh_said_rebellion_in_turkish_history | Kurdish]] history, was the grandson of Sheikh Ali Sepin, a prominent **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi]]** leader [00:40:24]-[00:40:34]. His family was among the most prestigious in the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] geography, and his ancestors had established a dominant presence in the Hınıs region with Ottoman backing [00:41:06]-[00:41:24].

With the establishment of the Turkish Republic, these **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi]]** leaders, who had built their power in allegiance with the Ottoman Empire, perceived the new regime's policies as a profound betrayal [00:41:39]-[00:41:47]. The Republic's efforts to centralize power further and assert control over regions previously dominated by religious and tribal leaders meant that the sheikhs' authority was undermined [00:41:47]-[00:42:00]. This perceived loss of power and traditional status contributed to the outbreak of the [[sheikh_said_rebellion_in_turkish_history | Sheikh Said rebellion]] in 1925 [00:25:41].

The rebellion was not a simple nationalistic or religious uprising, but a complex event. It is believed that there were attempts to unify two disparate groups: the modern [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] nationalist movement (centered in Syria, led by the Bedirhan brothers and organizations like Azadi) and the traditional **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Seyit and Sheikh movement]]** led by the **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandis]]** [00:42:19]-[00:43:56]. These two factions, despite their temporary alliance, held diametrically opposed political and social values [00:44:05]-[00:45:07]. The **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Sheikh Said rebellion]]** was brutally suppressed by the Turkish Republic, with its leader and many relatives executed publicly [00:27:43]-[00:28:03]. The suppression involved widespread atrocities, resulting in tens of thousands killed and villages burned, marking a period of severe oppression in the [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] region [00:28:07]-[00:28:22]. This act by the new regime aimed to send a clear message of its absolute power [00:28:47]-[00:28:50].

## Legacy

The **[[historical_context_of_kurdish_naqshbandi_movement | Naqshbandi sheikhs]]** left an indelible mark on [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] society. Their rise illustrated how religious institutions could fill power vacuums and establish new forms of authority, sometimes with state backing. Their eventual confrontation with the Turkish Republic underscored the clash between traditional religious and tribal structures and the modernizing, centralizing ambitions of the new nation-state. Today, for a significant segment of [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_of_the_kurds | Kurdish]] society, **[[sheikh_said_rebellion_in_turkish_history | Sheikh Said]]** remains a respected figure, viewed as a leader who fought for his faith and nation [00:25:24]-[00:26:04].

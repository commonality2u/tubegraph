The [[turkish_language_alphabet_and_pronunciation | Alphabet Revolution]] in Trkiye refers to the shift from the Arabic script to the Latin alphabet for writing Turkish. This event is distinct from the [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | language revolution]].

## Defining the Revolution
The [[turkish_language_alphabet_and_pronunciation | Alphabet Revolution]] and the [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | Language Revolution]] are two completely independent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The [[turkish_language_alphabet_and_pronunciation | Alphabet Revolution]] occurred in 1927-1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. In contrast, the [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | language revolution]] began in 1932 and peaked around 1935, indicating a four to five-year difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | language revolution]]'s aim was to eliminate all words of Arabic and Persian origin from Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Historical Context and Perceived Necessity
The [[necessity_of_the_alphabet_revolution | necessity of the Alphabet Revolution]] began to be recognized as early as the 1860s by many sensible people in Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The writing revolution was increasingly seen as a condition of modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

During the First Constitutional Era, especially between 1908 and 1918, the Ottoman ruling classes explored various ideas to reform the Arabic alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. There were considerations to radically reform the Arabic alphabet by transforming it into a fully alphabetic script that expressed all vowels and consonants separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, or to change the shapes of Arabic letters to be independent like Latin alphabet characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

From 1850 onwards, the cultural orientation of Trkiye's [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | ruling and cultured classes]] completely shifted towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. New ideas, educational destinations for children, literary forms, clothing fashions, scientific developments, political and legal concepts, and journalistic styles were all adopted from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This cultural alignment made it inevitable for the alphabet to be changed to resemble Western alphabets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The Arabic alphabet posed serious problems for writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It caused absurd results when trying to write foreign words not matching Turkish and Arabic sound structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. For example, deciphering place names in old maps and tax records written in Arabic script often makes it impossible to determine pronunciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Arguments for the Revolution
Two basic arguments often put forward for the [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | alphabet revolution]] are:
1.  **Increased Literacy:** It is argued that the new alphabet increased literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, this is disputed. Iran, for instance, preserved the Arabic alphabet for Persian (which is also a foreign alphabet for Persian sounds) and achieved a high literacy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Similarly, Israel uses an alphabet with the same letters and structure as Arabic (Hebrew alphabet) which was unfamiliar to most Jews until recently, yet achieved nearly 100% literacy through systematic education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Thus, the idea that the [[language_revolution_in_trkiye | Alphabet Revolution]] significantly contributed to literacy in Trkiye is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **Aided Westernization:** While the shift in cultural orientation made it inevitable, the direct contribution of the alphabet change to Westernization is also not considered highly significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, the Latin alphabet adopted in Trkiye is recognized as a much more advanced alphabet than the Arabic alphabet, being more suitable for expressing fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Therefore, despite the debated contributions to literacy and Westernization, the [[necessity_of_the_alphabet_revolution | alphabet revolution]] is largely seen as an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Influence of Other Alphabets
A crucial factor contributing to the [[necessity_of_the_alphabet_revolution | Alphabet Revolution]] was the rise of Turkish literature and journalism written in Armenian and Greek letters starting from the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Many Turkish novels and newspapers were published in Armenian and Greek scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. These Turkish newspapers covered daily news, international news, stock market updates, and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Increasingly, Muslims and Turks preferred reading these publications over those in Arabic letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Many even learned the Armenian alphabet specifically to read Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This was because both the Armenian and Greek alphabets were significantly more successful than the old Arabic script in expressing the nuances of spoken Turkish, being much easier and more direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

With growing literacy in Trkiye, there was a real possibility of people shifting towards the Armenian and Greek alphabets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Preventing this shift was difficult with the Arabic alphabet, making the transition to a new script seemingly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

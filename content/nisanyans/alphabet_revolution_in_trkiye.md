The Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye is a distinct historical event from the Language Revolution, though they are often confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The Alphabet Revolution took place in 1927-1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, while the Language Revolution began in 1932 and peaked in 1935, a difference of four to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The latter aimed to eliminate words of Arabic and Persian origin from Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, highlighting the [[difference_between_alphabet_and_language_revolution | distinction between the two movements]].

## Historical Necessity

The need for an alphabet change in Trkiye emerged as early as the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Most sensible people in Trkiye recognized the writing revolution as a prerequisite for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The Ottoman ruling classes, particularly between 1908 and 1918 (the First Constitutional Era), explored various proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. These included radically reforming the Arabic alphabet to make it a fully alphabetic script, expressing all vowels and consonants separately, and transforming Arabic letters into independent shapes akin to Latin printing letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. These attempts demonstrate the [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | long-standing consideration of alphabet reform]].

## Western Influence and Cultural Shift

From 1850 onwards, Trkiye's ruling, cultured, and educated classes experienced profound [[cultural_westernization_and_alphabet_change | cultural changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Their perspectives shifted, with the West becoming their primary reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. New ideas, educational destinations (Geneva, Paris, London), literary forms, fashion, scientific developments, and concepts of politics, law, and journalism were all adopted from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. In this context, the adoption of a Latin-like alphabet became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. While the argument that the alphabet revolution directly aided [[cultural_westernization_and_alphabet_change | westernization]] is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, it is acknowledged that a shift in the country's cultural structure and orientation naturally created strong pressure for an alphabet change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Limitations of the Arabic Alphabet for Turkish

The Arabic alphabet posed significant challenges for writing Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While these issues could potentially be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, the Latin alphabet, as adopted in Trkiye, is considered a more advanced script, better suited for expressing fine linguistic details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. For instance, when attempting to write foreign words or place names that do not align with Turkish and Arabic sound structures, the Arabic alphabet could lead to ambiguous or absurd results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. It was often impossible to discern the correct pronunciation of place names from old maps and tax records written in Arabic script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. In this regard, the alphabet revolution was an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Impact on Literacy: A Debated Claim

One common argument for the alphabet revolution is that it increased literacy rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, the speaker asserts this claim lacks a logical basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Other countries like Iran, which retained the Arabic alphabet (despite it being foreign to Persian sounds), achieved high literacy rates, comparable to or even surpassing those in Trkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Similarly, Israel, using an alphabet structurally similar to Arabic, imposed it through systematic education to achieve a 100% literacy rate, despite it being foreign to most Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Therefore, the speaker does not believe the Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye made a significant contribution to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

## Competition from Other Scripts

An important, often overlooked factor in the Alphabet Revolution was the rise of Turkish publications using non-Arabic scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. From the mid-19th century, a vibrant publishing scene emerged in Trkiye, featuring Turkish written with Armenian letters and Greek letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Numerous Turkish novels and regular newspapers (covering daily news, international affairs, stock market, and entertainment) were published in these scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Many Muslims and Turks began to prefer reading these versions over those written in Arabic letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, even learning the Armenian alphabet to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This was because the Armenian and Greek alphabets were significantly more effective and direct than the old Arabic script in conveying the nuances of spoken language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. With increasing literacy in Trkiye, there was a risk of people shifting en masse to Armenian and Greek alphabets, a trend that needed to be prevented. Preventing this with the Arabic alphabet would have been difficult, possibly requiring a massive educational campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

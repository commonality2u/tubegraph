## The Perceptions of Mikhail Gorbachev

Mikhail Gorbachev is viewed starkly differently depending on the region. In former Soviet countries like Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine, he is widely regarded as a traitor, an enemy of humanity, an agent who destroyed the country, and dishonorable [00:12:08]. Conversely, in the Western world, he is often celebrated as a "freedom hero" [00:12:29]. The speaker suggests that the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle [00:13:05].

## The Collapse of the Soviet System

The Soviet system was exhausted in every aspect: economically, ideologically, in its self-belief, and its institutional structure [00:13:12]. Living standards were on the verge of collapse [00:13:25]. The speaker compares its decay to that of the Ottoman Empire [00:13:32].

Two core issues contributed to its downfall:
*   **Suppression of Individual Greed and the Rise of the Police State** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>
    The Soviet project aimed to give humanity a new direction by preventing individual wealth accumulation [00:13:56]. However, this could only be achieved by establishing a "maniac police state" [00:14:28]. Over time, this police state became an end in itself, with oppression and tyranny becoming its sole reason for existence [00:14:35]. This uncontrolled state led to bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption [01:15:56].
*   **Unsustainability of National Mobilization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>
    While societal mobilization for development and civilization can be successful for a period (e.g., 10-20 years), it cannot be sustained indefinitely [01:15:17]. Such mobilization requires individuals to subordinate personal interests to the common cause, which eventually leads to bureaucracy [01:15:49]. Bureaucracy, in turn, falls prey to its own corruption and dull intelligence [01:16:13]. The Soviet Union became a "bureaucratic swamp" [01:16:31].

Despite being an exhausted system, the speaker notes that it wasn't entirely unsustainable, citing North Korea as an example of how a system can be sustained through military imposition [01:17:07].

### Comparison with China's Reforms

The speaker contrasts the Soviet collapse with China's transformation. China changed its system successfully, "without shedding blood" or "dragging the country into chaos" [01:17:39]. It transformed into "the most successful country in the world in every respect" [01:17:51]. This refutes the idea that communism was inherently destined to collapse [01:18:00]. China managed to develop its economy and create significant areas of freedom without undergoing a regime crisis [01:10:50].

### Aftermath of the [[history_and_impact_of_soviet_unions_dissolution | Soviet Union dissolution]]

The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a rare destruction and social collapse in modern history [01:18:47]. The standard of living for many was "reset to zero" [01:18:56]. People who had worked hard and trusted the state were condemned to misery, begging, prostitution, and gangsterism [01:19:09]. The average life expectancy radically fell, and a "tremendous wave of death" covered the country, leading to drastic population shrinkage [01:19:24].

## Gorbachev's Geopolitical Decisions and Their Consequences

Gorbachev's most significant historical step was withdrawing military presence from Eastern Europe in 1989 [01:23:36]. This move was seen as a "gift" of half of Germany (East Germany), along with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, to Germany [01:24:27]. These regions became a natural expansion area and hinterland for German industry and trade, visibly dominated by German businesses [01:25:04].

The speaker posits that this immense concession was not made out of naivety or weakness, but as part of an expected bargain [01:26:07]. The expectation was that [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] would be accepted into Europe as a part of European civilization, culture, and economy [01:27:39]. This would lead to the establishment of a "great Europe extending from Hamburg to the Pacific Ocean," with [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] as a founding element [01:27:58]. A German-Russian alliance was envisioned to reshape the world [01:28:09].

This prospect was highly attractive for Germany, as it would grant access to the vast, untouched Russian market for goods and services [01:28:22]. Furthermore, Europe, being poor in natural resources, would gain direct, duty-free access to [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]]'s immense resources (oil, natural gas, minerals), which would halt and reverse Europe's century-long decline [01:28:49].

### US Reaction and [[conflict_and_diplomacy_in_eastern_europe_and_the_role_of_nato | NATO]] Expansion

The speaker argues that the United States perceived Germany's potential fusion with [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] as an existential threat to America's world domination [01:30:19]. It would signify the end of the system established through Middle Eastern oil and could lead to Europe challenging American hegemony [01:30:34].

Consequently, starting from 1997-1998, the United States "suddenly restructured [[conflict_and_diplomacy_in_eastern_europe_and_the_role_of_nato | NATO]] as an offensive alliance against [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]]" [01:30:13]. The US systematically undermined [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]]'s efforts to democratize and restore public order, and most importantly, re-established and strengthened [[conflict_and_diplomacy_in_eastern_europe_and_the_role_of_nato | NATO]] on a platform hostile to [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] [01:31:16]. The speaker believes this is the "real reason for the current [[moscow_incident_and_escalation_of_ukraine_conflict | Ukrainian War]]" [01:31:33].

Germany, despite this, continued to develop a mutual dependency with [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]], investing in it and making itself dependent on Russian energy, notably through the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline [01:31:45]. The US strongly opposed Nord Stream 2, threatening Germany [01:32:47]. The "clear first result of the [[moscow_incident_and_escalation_of_ukraine_conflict | Ukrainian War]]" was Germany's announcement that Nord Stream 2 was shelved [01:33:14].

## [[political_changes_and_government_reforms | Russia]]'s Recovery Under Putin

After 10-15 years of chaos post-[[history_and_impact_of_soviet_unions_dissolution | Soviet Union dissolution]], [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]]'s income began to recover due to its existing infrastructure, strong educational system, cultural infrastructure, and rich natural resources [01:19:44].

Under the Putin administration over the last 20 years, [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] has experienced "unprecedented development" [01:20:01].
*   While not returning to the old Soviet period, there are few hungry and homeless people [01:20:11].
*   Security has been provided [01:20:20].
*   Banditry, theft, and mafia activities have been brought under control [01:20:25].
*   Major cities are characterized by clean, decent, prosperous shops, smiling people, and a certain middle-class standard of living [01:20:35].

The speaker attributes the Russian people's admiration for Putin to his success as a state manager [01:21:02]. He is described as intelligent, treating society like human beings, speaking logically, and possessing a humorous, modest leadership style that flatters national prejudices [01:21:27]. The constant Western propaganda denigrating him is labeled a "chain of lies" [01:22:03]. The speaker asserts that [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] has "never had such a successful leader for centuries" [01:22:20]. While acknowledging Putin's dictatorial aspects, the speaker argues that [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] is "not a worse country than America in terms of the extent of political dictatorship, police state, legal decay" [01:22:48].

## The Principle of Self-Determination and Its Limits

The discussion on various separatist movements (Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Catalonia, Galicia, Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh) highlights the logical absurdity reached by taking the concept of the "Nation State" and the "right of self-determination" too seriously [00:07:07]. If every group can declare independence, where does it end [00:07:07]?

The speaker uses [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Montenegro]] as a detailed example:
> "Montenegro, which has been a branch of the Serbian church since ancient times, with backs, a cultural, ideological, sectarian unity and integrity, now that state is the State of Montenegro, independent When they became a state they said; Our church must be a church independent of Serbian psychopathy. People are slaughtering each other in the streets. On this subject, I mean, our church must be affiliated with Serbia. Should it be defined as a separate sect? Should it not be a sect but a separate, independent, special church structure? To tell you the truth, there is no end to this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>

This extends to linguistic identity, with Serbian and Croatian now considered separate languages, and within [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Montenegro]], a debate over whether "Montenegrin" is a separate language or just a dialect of Serbian [00:09:18]. This fragmentation, from nation-states down to sub-regions and even linguistic differences, illustrates the endless nature of self-determination claims [01:07:07]. The speaker also notes how the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a chain reaction of independence movements, from the Baltic countries to Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, and could have continued into regions like Chechnya and Tatarstan [01:09:59].

## Current Geopolitical Situation and Europe's Energy Crisis

The speaker discusses the current economic and geopolitical instability. The Euro's collapse against the dollar and the Ruble's incredible increase in value are noted [01:03:49]. Europe faces an energy crisis with electricity prices increasing eightfold and natural gas tenfold, leading to fears of freezing winters [01:05:49].

The speaker questions the rationality of European leaders, suggesting that a simple solution to the energy crisis would be to "shake hands with [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]]" and buy their natural gas and oil, even paying in Rubles if necessary [01:06:45]. However, the world is not always ruled by reason [01:07:53].

## Other Observations

*   **Definition of the State:** The state is fundamentally described as "the biggest mafia organization" [01:08:06]. It collects tribute and, in return, promises protection against smaller mafias [01:08:15]. Societies need this, as breaking up one mafia only leads to the emergence of others [01:08:47].
*   **Gender Inequality:** The historical basis of male-female inequality is not primarily muscle power, but rather women's role in fertility and child-rearing [01:58:39]. Women's prolonged dependency after childbirth creates a need for protection and provision, leading to a dynamic where men historically undertook roles of providing and protecting [01:00:25].
*   **Modern Architecture:** The speaker laments the widespread ugliness and aesthetic blindness in modern architecture across the world, contrasting it with the centuries of beautiful, unique, and varied architectural traditions in Europe and other regions [01:20:38].

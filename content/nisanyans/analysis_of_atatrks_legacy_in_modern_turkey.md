From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The legacy of [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and the [[Cultural and historical analysis of Turkish identity | Kemalism]] ideology are presented as fundamental to understanding a "social disease" in modern Turkey, with roots tracing back to the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Regime of Terror (1923-1938)

From 1923 to 1938, the country reportedly lived under a "regime of terror," where people were terrified on many levels, having no idea what could happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The assumption during this period was that freedom would come upon [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]]'s death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Post-1938 Psychological Impact

After [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]]'s death on November 10, 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, people reportedly lost their honor and buried their personalities with him, unable to overcome their fear and shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This inability to speak freely in 1938 is considered the basic starting point of the social disease known as Kemalism/Ataturkism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. There was a "suppression of consciousness" and fear pushed into the subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Comparisons to Other Dictatorships

A similar fear was observed in the Soviet Union during Stalin's time and in Germany during Hitler's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. [[Impact of major historical figures on Turkish politics | Atatürk]] is described as a dictator whose wisdom was unquestionable and who was above all law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Attempts to Manage Atatürk's Image

### İnönü Period (Post-1938)

During the İnönü period, there were efforts to make [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] forgotten and erase him from the historical and political stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. His photographs and pictures were removed from money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, and a planned monumental grave was not started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Existing monuments were renovated and made invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Post-1950 Policy Shift

In 1950, with the change of government, a "rational policy" was followed to put the past "in a museum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The "Atatürk protection law" was passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, his tomb was built and turned into a national symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. His image was put back on money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The hope was that he would gradually be forgotten, becoming a symbol "whose content has been emptied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### The Problem of Non-Confrontation

> [!warning] Critical Assessment
> The speaker posits that the main reason why Turkey's "great experiment," the Republic of Turkey, "ended in a great fiasco within 100 years is the fact that this society has not confronted the reality of [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] and [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]]'s past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

A dead [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] was effectively "taken out of his grave" to create internal division and an internal enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. A mythology surrounding [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] became a "halo of holiness" and a "loyalty test" for those seeking political or academic positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. This was evident in the 1960s and again in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

## Case Study: Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's "A Bitter Story"

The speaker references Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil's 1945 book, "A Bitter Story," which recounts the painful circumstances surrounding his son Vedat's suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. Halit Ziya, a prominent novelist and a representative of the Ottoman aristocracy, was also a relative of Latife Uşaklıgil, [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]]'s wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

### The Vedat Incident

Vedat Uşaklıgil stayed at the Çankaya mansion as a guest of his cousin Latife Hanım <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. According to common rumor, his presence led to irreconcilable differences between Latife and [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. Later, [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] instructed Vedat to be given a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. However, Vedat encountered difficulties, culminating in his suicide in 1937 while serving at the Albanian embassy in Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.

### Suppression in the Narrative

Halit Ziya's book, written in pain, makes an extraordinary effort to protect his son's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. However, it is seen as a text of "terrifying psychological suppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. The book details the injustices Vedat faced, but crucially omits any information about *why* these injustices occurred or their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. Rumors about Vedat, widely known at the time, are not mentioned even once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

Despite [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]]'s initial directive, Vedat was subjected to mistreatment and ultimately fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras is implicated as the "main villain," claiming orders came "from above" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. When Halit Ziya sought an audience with [[Ataturks influence and personal life | Atatürk]] through Hasan Rıza Soyak (Presidential Secretary General), he was told it "wouldn't be very appropriate" for the country's greatest novelist to meet the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>. Even after a petition, Vedat was reinstated but treated "like a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>.

This narrative reveals the tragic reality of a man "crushed, exhausted, and whose life is darkened in the gap between his son's honor and reputation and his own helplessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. The book is considered incomprehensible without knowing this specific historical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

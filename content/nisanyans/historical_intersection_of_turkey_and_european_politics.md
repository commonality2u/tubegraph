The political landscape of Europe is undergoing significant shifts, influenced by broader global geopolitical changes and internal dynamics within the United States. This era sees the potential decline of established political orders and the emergence of new political alignments.

## Impact of US Political Changes on Europe and Turkey

The recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States signals a profound change that is anticipated to have a "tremendous chain reaction" across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. This is attributed to the perceived defeat of a "neocon" team that has held key positions in the American state and allied countries for the past 25-26 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.

### Decline of the "Neocon" Cadre
From 1997-98, a "neocon team" is asserted to have seized key positions in the American state, fully consolidating power by 2001 through a series of new laws under the guise of fighting terrorism and establishing entities like the Ministry of Homeland Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. This cadre then initiated a series of wars to consolidate its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. Even during Donald Trump's first presidency, he was reportedly turned into a "puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>, with incidents like the COVID-19 pandemic being used as a blow against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>.

The eventual downfall of this cadre is linked to its "arrogance and pride" reaching a peak, attempting to govern like "ancient Roman Emperors" by promoting perceived senile and foolish figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>. This led to a collapse of credibility and the loss of belief in their capacity and intelligence to govern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.

### Anticipated Toppling of European Governments
Due to the close alignment, "almost all" of the cadres currently in power in the European Union are seen as people "appointed by this team and brought to elected positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>. Consequently, the "elimination of this team" is predicted to lead to the successive toppling of current ruling blocs in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. Specific examples include:
*   The German government, which "raised the flag of bankruptcy" and is heading to elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.
*   The government in England, which is not expected to "survive much longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.
*   The Macron regime in France, whose longevity is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.
*   Ursula von der Leyen's ability to remain in power is seen as a "very serious question mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.

This shift is expected to extend to media and non-governmental organizations as well, with "countless propaganda officers disguised as journalists" and "so-called non-governmental organizations financed by them" being overthrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>. In Türkiye, many journalists holding key positions and engaged in propaganda for the US and EU under the guise of opposition are predicted to "gradually lose their jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

## Germany, Russia, and NATO's Strategic Chess Game
The most "serious and important chess game" in the world is described as the potential for Russia and Germany to draw closer to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
*   For Russia, "winning this war means winning Europe," and this is "possible only if it wins Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>.
*   For America and NATO, winning means "strongly protecting its integrity and unity" and "building a solid wall between Germany and Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>. This is identified as the "ultimate meaning and goal of the fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>.

At present, Germany cannot get closer to Russia with a political staff consisting "entirely of American pawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59:00">[32:59:00]</a>. However, a change in German political staff is expected to impact this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>. The political figure of Sara Wagenknecht is highlighted as a "weather vane" for whether Germany will truly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>, with hopes expressed for her to become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. Her number two, Sevim Dağdelen, is also noted as a "very bright, very admirable person" of Turkish origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>, representing a diverse hope for Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Historical Narrative and Identity
Turkey's historical narrative, particularly concerning figures like Timur, Atilla, and Genghis Khan, reflects a significant ideological transformation during the Republican era.

### Reconciling with Timur
Historically, Ottoman historiography depicted Timur as the "epitome of evil" – a cruel, ruthless, and irreligious figure who destroyed Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a>. However, a striking ideological transformation of the Republic involved elevating Timur, alongside Atilla and Genghis Khan, to the ranks of "Turkish greats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. These figures, despite being historically seen as symbols of cruelty and "enemies of civilization," became national heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a>.

A notable symptom of this ideological shift is the adoption of names like Atilla, Genghis, or Timur as personal names in Turkey since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>. Prior to the 20th century, no one in Turkey would use these names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.

### The Avshars and [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | Historical Continuity]]
The discussion of the Avshars highlights the complex layers of Turkish identity and [[historical_continuity_in_turkey | historical continuity in Turkey]].
*   **Diverse Origins**: Some Avshars in Turkey are Turkish, while others are Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:10]</a>. This includes a group of Iranian Turks, mostly Turkish-speaking, who migrated to Anatolia as refugees after Nadir Khan's rule in Iran in the 1720s-30s and settled primarily in the Kayseri region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.
*   **Oghuz Tribe Connection**: The name Avshar is also associated with one of the 24 Oghuz tribes, mentioned in history since the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. However, the exact meaning of Oghuz tribal organization within the Ottoman Empire (ethnic group, family structure, or military symbol) remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
*   **Dispersed Settlements**: There are 50-60 villages named Avşar across Turkey, the Caucasus, and Western Iran, yet no clear connection can be established between them and the Avşar tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. Ironically, places heavily settled by Avşars often do not bear the name Avşar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. Some "Avşar" villages have historically been Greek or Armenian, further complicating the origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

## Architectural Heritage and [[historical_and_architectural_influences_between_trkiye_and_its_neighbors | Historical and Architectural Influences]]
The urban and architectural landscape of Turkey largely originates from the Seljuk and Beylik (principality) periods, not primarily the Ottoman era, particularly outside of the three imperial capitals.

### Seljuk and Beylik Period Urbanization
Most provincial and district centers in modern Turkey were founded during the Seljuk and Beylik periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. The current texture of many city centers is a product of this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>. All truly impressive standing architectural works (excluding the capitals) are from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. The Ottoman period left a "very limited architectural heritage" in the Anatolian countryside, primarily standardized template mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

The Seljuk period, roughly from the 1190s to 1453, was a time of "great urbanization" in Anatolia, with cities and towns established at key geographical and trade intersections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>. These centers featured "original architecture," including mosques, madrasahs, bridges, caravanserais, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:43:00">[31:43:00]</a>. Unlike Ottoman mosques, which were often built from central templates, Seljuk and Beylik mosques were unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.

### Divriği Mosque and Armenian Influence
The Sivas Divriği Mosque raises questions about Armenian architectural contributions. From the 12th century onwards, architecture in Anatolia, particularly east of the Euphrates, drew from existing civilizations. Islamic architecture in this region is seen as a continuation of Armenian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>.

The question of whether architects were Armenian is deemed "meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a> because a "brand new interpretation," an "Islamic synthesis," was created upon the foundations of old Armenian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. This synthesis incorporated Armenian architectural traditions, technical mastery, and forms, giving them a "new interpretation, a new spirit, a new style, a new ideological meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>.

The case of the "Armenian Shahs" (Ahlatshahs) kingdom established around Ahlat shortly after the Battle of Malazgirt (1071) is cited as an example. This kingdom, whose ruling dynasty was supposedly Turkish but likely consisted of local people enslaved and trained by Turks, created a new architectural synthesis in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>. This perspective offers a new understanding of the conquest of Anatolia, seeing it not as a complete replacement of populations but as the emergence of a new civilization vision, ideology, and state, which transformed existing structures and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.

## Contemporary Political and Economic Challenges in Turkey
Turkey is described as being caught in a "blind fight between Muslim bigots and Kemalist bigots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a>, with "not the slightest sign that it will be saved from this fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a>.

### The 1961 Constitution
The 1961 Constitution, often said to be "one size too big" for Turkish society, is seen as primarily anti-democratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. Its fundamental aim was to restrict democratic power to sustain the Kemalist regime after the Democrat Party's rule showed that an elected government with absolute power could threaten its foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

Key anti-democratic measures in the 1961 Constitution:
*   **Proportional Representation**: Made it "almost impossible for any party to gain an absolute majority in the parliament," forcing coalition governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. This shifted decision-making power from public vote to "bargaining done in the lobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, allowing "sovereign powers of the state" to assert their preferences discreetly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **National Defense Institution**: A "supra-government government" was created under this name, effectively governing Turkey from 1960 to 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This council, dominated by soldiers and backed by NATO, determined military, foreign, and internal security policies, overriding elected governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.
*   **High Courts**: The establishment of high courts like the Constitutional Court, Court of Cassation, Council of State, and Court of Accounts further "tied the hands of the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.

While the constitution included "well-intentioned rights and freedoms" translated from Western constitutions, these were effectively "bubbles" without political power behind them, leading to their gradual curtailment after the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

### The Power of Money and Weapons
A critical analysis of modern democratic societies, including Turkey, highlights that elected governments often lack real authority over the two most important dimensions of social governance: money and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.
*   **Money**: Central Banks, along with other financial institutions, determine how much money is produced and who uses it, operating independently of elected governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>. This authority to distribute artificially produced money allows them to direct funds within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.
*   **Weapons**: Military and police forces are described as self-sustaining organizations, subject to their own laws and hierarchies, with elected governments having no real authority over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

This implies that "democratic" societies are in fact "managed by mechanisms that are completely outside of control and independent" of democratic oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.

## Global Geopolitical Landscape
The broader geopolitical landscape, including the US presidential election, is influenced by the ongoing Ukraine War and the perceived decline of the "neocon" establishment that has governed the US and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. This shift is anticipated to have significant ripple effects on European governments and their alignment with US foreign policy objectives.

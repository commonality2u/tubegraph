Geopolitical shifts and [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | Türkiye]]'s position in global affairs are a recurring topic of discussion, particularly concerning recent domestic and international developments.

## Shifting Stances and International Pressure
Following recent elections, there has been an observed withdrawal of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan from the immediate political foreground, accompanied by the increased prominence of Hakan Fidan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This shift is described as a "very, very clear" "softening and withdrawal incident" since the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Notable developments include:
*   Attitudes taken before the NATO summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   A meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   The return of Azov militants, despite previous promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   The cancellation of Putin's visit to [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]], reportedly due to a lack of "green light" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

These events are considered "thought-provoking developments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The appointments of Mehmet Şimşek and the Central Bank's general manager have raised "question marks" and "anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It is suggested that [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]] faces significant "financial pressure" due to a "very serious monetary crisis" and "payments crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This financial situation may have led to "conveniences" being shown in return for "something... imposed" regarding its stance on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

One hypothesis suggests that the shift is due to a perception in Ankara that Russia has lost ground in the war and suffered a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. However, this is deemed unlikely, as Russia is not seen as heading toward failure in the war against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

A more "frightening" possibility is that the Western front may "have difficulty in making some important decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Statements from key Western officials imply a move towards war, stemming from a belief that defeat in Ukraine is "out of the question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This suggests an intention to "expand the war front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. In this context, [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]] is being "forced to take a side and make a decision," implying its "arm is being twisted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

The speaker notes a "sign of wavering, a shaking in [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s attitude towards this war, which was extremely positive until yesterday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.

### Sweden's NATO Membership
The issue of Sweden's NATO membership is presented as a "test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. If [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Turkey]] allows Sweden to become a NATO member, it would signify a "lost" struggle for independence, having "tried to make a show of independence and failed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. This would indicate that [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]] encountered a "force major" and "bowed down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. The outcome regarding Sweden's membership will determine if [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]] "play[s] the game well" or if its power is "not enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

## Historical Context of [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s Political Axis
For 150 years, the "main axis of Turkish politics" has been defined by "westernization and the west" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. The [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkish left]] historically originated from a Westernist tradition, representing an "extreme point of the westernization, modernization and progress school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. After joining NATO in the 1950s, the [[political_landscape_and_dynamics_in_turkey_and_the_world | Turkish left]] became confused about its direction, as it was instinctively Westernist but opposed to America and NATO at the head of the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. This ideological confusion prevented it from taking an "effective place in Turkish politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.

Conversely, the Islamist movement in [[historical_and_political_analysis_of_trkiye | Türkiye]] in the 1950s and 60s was "violently anti-Western" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. In the 1970s, with Erbakan, Turkish Islamism changed direction to become the "carrier of the anti-Western front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. It is noted that the anti-Western stances of figures like İbrahim Kaypakkaya and those represented by Süleyman Soylu today (rather than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) "have evolved towards a common place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

## Opposition and National Development
The opposition in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is criticized for its "politics of burden" and lack of societal response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. The speaker agrees that this "politics of burden" is why the opposition does not find a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. It is asserted that if groups like the Chamber of Architects and Engineers or the Association of Physicians are against something, "it is necessary to support that thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. This stance is rooted in a historical observation that "some people throughout history have always wanted... to oppose" innovation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. A "coalition of unwilling burdens" has resisted innovation in the Ottoman Empire since the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.

Regarding development, it is stated that "growth requires taking risks" and sometimes necessitates "breaking and disintegrating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. While recognizing the "rawness" and "negative consequences" of some development efforts in [[current_geopolitical_issues_involving_trkiye | Türkiye]], it is asked if the alternative is to "say no to everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:32">[01:28:32]</a>. The opposition is characterized as a "cowardly group" afraid of losing their achieved social status and falling into the proletariat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.

## Gezi Park Protests and Foreign Manipulation
The 2014 Euro Square uprising in Ukraine is described as a "very clearly wrong uprising," "manipulated, malicious," and one that "caused a national disaster" and "murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. Similar claims are made for the Georgian Revolution and events in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. These instances are characterized as countries being "stirred up in a 10-degree cynical and extremely treacherous way," leading to coups and disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

The question is posed whether similar manipulation existed behind the Gezi events in [[political_situation_in_trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. While the speaker cannot confirm this, vouching for the honesty of some Gezi participants like Osman Kavala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>, it is acknowledged that Americans "wrote the book on this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. This strategy involves exploiting "legitimate complaints" among urban youth to "create an uprising," "chaos," and thus "overthrow some governments they don't like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

## Historical Speculation: Abdulhamid II's Reign
When considering hypothetical historical scenarios, such as what would have happened if Abdulhamid II had not been overthrown, a "good historian" would typically respond "it couldn't have been otherwise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>. This deterministic view suggests that historical events have sufficient reasons and were inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>.

The speaker highlights the "great tent of stagnation" in the Ottoman Empire after the 1890s, affecting economic, cultural, and administrative aspects, characterized by paralysis and an aging administrative staff due to lack of circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. This internal stagnation sharply contrasted with the "tremendous breakthrough era" of the early 20th century, marked by rapid technological advancements, new art movements, and boiling political structures globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>. The incompatibility between the Ottoman state's stagnation and the "mad progress of the outside world" made an explosion of issues like the Macedonian and Albanian Revolts inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>.

The speaker believes that even if Abdulhamid had not been overthrown, these developments "had to break out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>. While the Balkan War might have been "delayed a little longer" had he remained in charge, its outbreak was ultimately "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>.

Regarding Ottoman involvement in World War I, Abdulhamid's "basic instinct was to upset the balances" and "use the Europeans against each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>, not to join arms with Germany against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. Even if the Ottomans had not joined WWI, the outcome might not have been significantly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. For instance, Britain's need for oil resources from Iraq was clear after 1905, as naval power shifted from coal to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:22">[02:03:22]</a>. To maintain global dominance, Britain "had to take Iraq" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:46">[02:03:46]</a>. This mathematical logic dictated that France would be given Syria as a "consolation gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:54">[02:04:54]</a>. These regions would have been taken from the Ottomans "in any case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:33">[02:05:33]</a>.

The "cleaning project" (presumably referring to the Armenian Genocide) implemented by the Young Turk cadres was described as an "extremely scientific, extremely systematic, extremely bureaucratic destruction project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>. While it might have been different under Abdulhamid, the outcome "wouldn't have been like that," and there would not have been a "big difference in terms of the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:45">[02:06:45]</a>.

## Ottoman Conquest and Conversion
Regarding the hypothetical scenario of the Ottomans forcibly converting conquered peoples to Islam, it is stated that they "could not have done it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:29">[02:15:29]</a>. Historically, conquering powers rarely achieved such widespread forced conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:35">[02:15:35]</a>. The main source of income for the Ottoman Empire was the "taxation of Christians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a>. The empire's function was not to convert non-Muslims but to "farm and have jobs ready in hand," managing the Christian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>. Forcing conversion would have led to the Ottoman Empire quickly going "bankrupt financially" and "economically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:36">[02:16:36]</a>.

## Economic Contribution of the Kurdistan Region
The Kurdistan Region's contribution to national income is acknowledged as being lower than the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. However, it is stressed that the region is not only a producer but also a consumer, providing a market for Western companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>. The question should not be how much of the national income goes to Kurdistan, but "how much value is transferred from Kurdistan" to the West and "what percentage of the source of the West's wealth comes from the exploitation of Kurdistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:36">[02:33:36]</a>.

## History of Muş and Armenian Culture
The town of Muş is significant in Armenian history as the birthplace of Mesrop Mashtots, who invented the Armenian alphabet in 405 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>. This alphabet was created to translate the Bible into Armenian, a pivotal event as it allowed Armenian to continue as a distinct cultural entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. This was crucial after the Armenian Kingdom suffered severe blows from Byzantium and Iran in the late 4th century, leading to its destruction and formal end in 428 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:48">[02:25:48]</a>. The creation of an Armenian religious literature prevented assimilation into Iranian Zoroastrianism or Greek Christian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>.

Historically, in the early 19th century, "almost all the villages of the Muş plain were Armenians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. The city of Muş itself was predominantly Kurdish, ruled by the independent Muş Principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:55">[02:30:55]</a>. Interactions between Kurdish highlanders and Armenian villagers involved "friendships and enmities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:49">[02:30:49]</a>. By the 1830s, the Ottomans liquidated the Kurdish principalities, establishing a more central administration, which upset the religious and tribal balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:17">[02:33:17]</a>. By the late 19th century, over half of the Muş plain's population was Muslim and Kurdish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:53">[02:33:53]</a>. Many Armenians converted to Islam for social reasons and subsequently became Kurdish, adopting the local language and integrating into tribal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:07">[02:34:07]</a>. By the early 20th century, Armenians were a minority in Muş province, and by 1918, "they were gone for an unknown reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:03">[02:35:03]</a>.

## Karaite Jews and Turkish Language
Karaite Jews were a distinct Jewish sect that formed a large community in the Crimean Khanate until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:33">[02:36:33]</a>. They spoke Turkish, specifically a version of Crimean Tatar, because it was the common language of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:44">[02:36:44]</a>. Their home language was Turkish, mixed with Jewish words, forming an "original Turkish" dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:50">[02:37:50]</a>. After coming under Russian rule in the late 19th century, due to Jewish persecution in Russia, some Karaite communities dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:02">[02:38:02]</a>. A metropolitan part migrated to Istanbul, where they knew Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>. In Istanbul, a section of the Hasköy Jewish cemetery is reserved for Karaite graves, often with Cyrillic and Russian alphabets, but containing Crimean Turkish inscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:32">[02:38:32]</a>. The Karaite community in Istanbul eventually "melted away" and largely assimilated with mainstream Jews or migrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:02">[02:39:02]</a>. Currently, there is no longer a Karaite presence in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:16">[02:39:16]</a>. The rumor that Istanbul's Karaköy neighborhood is named "Kara Village" after the Karaites is mentioned, though not confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

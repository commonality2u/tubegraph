## Global Demographic Decline

There is an "incredible demographic collapse" occurring worldwide, with a radical decline in birth rates observed everywhere except Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:54">[01:18:54]</a>. For instance, South Korea's fertility rate has plummeted to 0.68, meaning that if this trend continues, two-thirds of its population could be eliminated within a generation, reducing the current population of 60 million to 20 million in about 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

For the human race to sustain itself, a fertility rate of at least 2.1 births per woman is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>. In Western Europe, the fertility rate hovers around 1.1-1.2, while in the United States, it is also significantly below two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. [[demographic_challenges_especially_in_countries_with_high_female_workforce_participation | Turkey]] has also seen a considerable drop in its fertility rate among Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>. In contrast, fertility rates remain higher and continue to increase in Africa, South America, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This global trend raises the possibility of the "extinction of the white race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Declining Birth Rates

Several factors contribute to this demographic shift:

### Female Workforce Participation
Encouraging women to pursue careers outside the home, family, and village has a "radical" suppressive effect on fertility rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

### Delayed Marriage and Extramarital Affairs
The increasing age at which people marry significantly impacts fertility rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>. Delaying marriage often normalizes extramarital affairs, which in turn leads to the "disappearance of the meaning of marriage" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. When marriage becomes just one of many long-term relationships, its stability is compromised, causing people to hesitate or fear having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

### Housing Affordability and Ownership
The astronomical rise in house prices, making homeownership almost impossible for young people, is another major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. In a normal, well-functioning society, a young person should be able to acquire a house with a few months' income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>. The ability to own a home is crucial before people consider marriage and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like Russia and other former Soviet and Socialist nations, where private home ownership rates are very high, with many inheriting homes free of rent, mortgage, or property tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. In Western societies, homeownership for the younger generation has become "beyond imagination," signifying a major "administrative disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>.

During the period of the [[Armenian Genocide | Deportation]], [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] families in Istanbul faced significant disruption to their lives, including educational opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Closure of Armenian Schools in 1915

All [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] schools in Istanbul were closed in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This closure directly impacted students, including individuals who were in middle school at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Alternative Education during Closure

With the closure of [[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] schools, some students sought education elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For example, a student attended a school opened by French Jews for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This provided an opportunity to learn French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Reopening of Armenian Schools in 1918

[[Armenian history and relations | Armenian]] schools were eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, for some, this reopening came after life-altering events, such as marriage, had already occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

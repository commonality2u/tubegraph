Neoconservatism emerged as a significant force in [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] foreign policy, particularly influencing the nation's approach to global affairs since the late 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. It is regarded as one of the most crucial questions regarding recent world politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

## Origins and Rise to Power
The movement, often referred to as "Neoconservatism," began to surface within academic circles and journals in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. A key publication for this ideology was the magazine "Commentary" (referred to as "Comen" in the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Many of its early writers were former Marxists and even Trotskyists who progressively adopted a more radical, "Neo Imperialist" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

Their influence grew in the late 1990s during the Clinton administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. However, they gained substantial power from 2001 onwards, coinciding with George W. Bush's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. They had already established a cadre within the Republican Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. After the September 11 attacks, this group fully took control of [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | America's]] internal and external security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

Notable figures associated with this group include the Kristol family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. They first dominated the [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | American]] Foreign Ministry and subsequently the Pentagon during Donald Rumsfeld's tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. By 2016, with Donald Trump's takeover of the Republican Party, many Neoconservatives switched allegiance to the Democratic Party, where they are now seen as influencing the country's and the world's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

## Core Ideology and Characteristics
The ideology of Neoconservatives is characterized by:
*   **Arrogance and Prejudice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Belief in American Hegemony**: The conviction that [[american_imperialism_and_henry_kissinger | America]] must dominate the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Moral Discourse as Propaganda**: Emphasizing democracy, human rights, and freedom primarily as tools for propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Hostility towards Russia**: An unwavering view of Russia as an enemy that must be disintegrated and destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This is based on an irrational, almost adolescent, "cowboy wannabe" hostility that cannot be explained rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Historical Depth**: A perceived lack of moral basis and historical knowledge among those who graduated from universities after 1968, contributing to this ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Absence of Tradition**: A failure to draw from tradition and accumulated experience from past masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **"We are America" justification**: Policies are justified simply because "we are [[american_imperialism_and_henry_kissinger | America]], the natural owners of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### Contrast with Earlier American Foreign Policy
Before the end of the Cold War, particularly up to the 1980s, [[american_and_european_political_dynamics | American]] foreign policy was shaped by a cadre with strong and deep intellectual foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This older guard, including figures like George (likely George Kennan) and [[american_imperialism_and_henry_kissinger | Henry Kissinger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, possessed a deep understanding of European and diplomatic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. While their policies were often ruthless, they lacked the "cowboyism" seen in modern Neoconservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. The shift is attributed to a generational change, where newer generations lacked historical grounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

## Role of Ethnic and Cultural Background
A significant observation about the Neoconservative group is that a large percentage of its members are Eastern European Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a> and the magazine "Commentary" itself was specifically a Jewish publication that dealt with issues of Jewish society and thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. While the speaker does not endorse the view of an organized Jewish global conspiracy, it is suggested that "handicaps coming from cultural past, ethnic origin, family tradition" might explain their "anachronistic obsession with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

## Impact on Global Stability
Neoconservative policies, particularly their aim to destroy Russia, are seen as a "crime against humanity" that must be prevented at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Their strategy often involves destabilizing nations, as seen in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. They are believed to lack experience in developing or supporting countries, preferring to "pull the plug" and instigate conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. This approach is perceived as driven by a "sick people" who use financial and military power to destroy the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:27">[01:41:27]</a>.

The Neoconservative aversion to cooperation between Europe and Russia, particularly Germany and Russia, is seen as a key driver of their policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Such cooperation, combining Europe's capital and population with Russia's vast natural resources, would secure Europe's future and superior global position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This alliance is perceived as a threat by [[american_imperialism_and_henry_kissinger | American]] Neoconservatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. England's role in this dynamic is noted to be even more aggressive than the [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | US]], strongly pushing for the disruption of German-Russian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>.

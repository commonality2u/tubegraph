[[Mustafa Kemals policies and legacy | Kemalism]] is widely observed in Türkiye's coastal regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, its spread into inland areas is attributed to two primary social bases, with a third significant group also contributing to its presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Social Bases for Kemalism's Spread

### [[Impact of Greek immigrants on Kemalisms spread | Greek Immigrants]]
The first significant social base for the spread of [[Mustafa Kemals policies and legacy | Kemalism]] consists of immigrants, notably those of Greek origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Between 1878 and 1913, over a million immigrants arrived in Anatolia from regions like Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These populations were predominantly settled in the Western parts of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, particularly the Marmara Aegean Region, the coastal areas of the Aegean, and the Western and Central Black Sea regions, forming an arc of settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Among these communities, the Republican People's Party and [[Mustafa Kemals policies and legacy | Kemalism]] enjoy strong support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Educated Civil Servants
The second base comprises segments of the population who are considered "educated" by Türkiye's average standards, typically civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These individuals, who may not be exposed to global culture, distinguish themselves from the common populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The career path of a civil servant in Türkiye often involves postings in inland cities like Çorum, Diyarbakır, or Denizli for much of their 30-year career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Upon retirement, many choose to settle in coastal cities such as Izmir, Antalya, or Bursa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, these coastal provinces have a high concentration of retired civil servants, along with their children and grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For this segment, [[Mustafa Kemals policies and legacy | Kemalism]] serves as a class indicator, providing a sense of being "more valuable people" than the general average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### [[Alevi community and their association with Kemalism | Alevi Community]]
A third significant group supporting [[Mustafa Kemals policies and legacy | Kemalism]] is the [[Alevi community and their association with Kemalism | Alevi community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Historically, the Alevi homeland was primarily in inner Eastern Anatolia, specifically Sivas, Malatya, and Tokat, where the Alevi population was dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For Alevis, the symbol of Kemal has become a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It represents their claim to being the rightful owners of the country and state, despite feeling ignored, disregarded, and excluded by existing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

However, since the 1980s, the Alevi population in their traditional homelands has drastically decreased due to systematic oppression, forcing many to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. A significant portion migrated to Europe, while a large number moved to major Turkish cities like Istanbul, Ankara, and the Aegean region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In these new locations, they continue to embrace the Kemalist ideology as a last resort, their sole hope against oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This perspective, while seemingly contradictory to some, is understandable when considering the reasons behind people's affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Israel-Palestine conflict]] is viewed as a historical disgrace, particularly from the perspective of how a settled population was ignored in favor of establishing a new state [02:49:00]. Europeans are seen as having used the persecution of Jews as an excuse to give them a "home" in a land already inhabited for centuries, disregarding the rights of the existing population [02:52:22].

## Historical Injustice and Displacement
Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their lands in 1948 and again in 1967, contrary to claims that they sold their properties [02:57:00]. This expulsion was achieved through terror and force of arms, leading to confiscation of their lands and a ban on their return [02:58:08]. Many were forced into refugee camps and assembly centers, living in terrible conditions [03:00:32]. In 1967, Israel occupied these places and established a system of cruelty and tyranny [03:00:41].

Ethnic cleansing is tragically one of the constants of human history, as people have consistently struggled to share limited lands, often driving each other out [02:14:39]. While ethnic cleansing is considered terrible, the worst part is the uprooting of people and societies from their homes, leading to homelessness and profound injustice that leaves generational wounds [02:22:40]. People can get used to murder, but not to injustice, especially its glorification and imposition [02:41:06].

## Shifting Perceptions of Israel
Initially, there was an inclination to agree with Israel, especially around 2005, due to impressions of it being a civilized place that created conditions for humane living [02:41:00]. Positive impressions included visits to the University of Jerusalem, contact with its people, and observations of impressive conditions, as well as trips to Edi Kutunu and the Golan Hill [02:41:00]. These experiences suggested a society striving to be beautiful [02:43:00].

However, this feeling has gradually diminished over the past 20 years [02:43:00]. The [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | political situation in Israel]] has shifted, with increasingly fanatic cadres coming to power, holding an ideology and moral understanding reminiscent of 1930s Germany [02:44:00]. This has led to Israel adopting a perspective of "we are strong, we can do whatever we want" [02:56:00].

The ongoing struggle for 70 years has hardened souls and brought an ideology of hostility to the center of Israel's existence [03:00:11]. Statements by Israeli defense ministers, referring to Palestinians as "animals" rather than human, reflect this perspective and associated management methods [03:00:30]. Repeated bombings and invasions of Gaza, along with massacres, have led to Israel losing its moral superiority [03:00:48].

## International Stance and Conflict Escalation
The world today appears sharply divided on the [[palestine_and_israel_conflict | Israel-Palestine issue]], with the overwhelming majority of humanity (excluding America and Western Europe) siding almost unanimously with Palestine [03:11:13]. This situation is not expected to end well, and the possibility of war is considered very strong [03:18:47].

Israel's current massacre policy in Gaza could endanger regimes in Iran and Arab countries if they fail to act, as public patience has worn thin [03:22:00]. There is a belief that a major war is almost inevitable [03:26:00]. The Western world seems to share this opinion, evidenced by the deployment of the largest naval force concentration in recent history to the Eastern Mediterranean [03:33:00].

## Western Military Challenges in the Middle East
Despite Western military deployments, there is a prediction that the West will lose this war [03:40:00]. The possibility of the West and NATO winning a war against the entire [[middle_east_conflicts_and_ceasefire_in_israel | Middle East]] and Iran is considered unlikely [03:40:00]. If the conflict escalates to nuclear levels, Russia and China would become involved, leading to a "complete big brawl" [03:40:00].

Even without nuclear escalation, Western military power, like in Ukraine and East Asia, is seen as overextended [03:40:00]. Logistical challenges and distance make it difficult for Western forces to effectively engage compared to regional powers like Russia near Ukraine [03:40:00]. Western forces have dispersed too widely while attempting global domination, leaving them confined to difficult-to-support forward bases [03:40:00].

## Strategic Importance of Jordan
For Iran and its allied forces, opening a northern front against Israel is strategically difficult due to the narrow terrain [03:40:00]. The side that could genuinely threaten Israel is Jordan, allowing for an easy attack on a wide front [03:40:00]. Jordan, traditionally aligned with the West, is identified as the key country from a strategic perspective [03:40:00]. It is suggested that Jordan might unexpectedly show courage and attack, or there could be developments shaking the Jordanian regime if the war escalates [03:40:00]. Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are currently under Iran's control, allowing for various military operations [03:40:00].

## Proposed Solutions and Their Implications
The common desire for peace, where Palestinians and Israelis reconcile, is deemed impossible [03:40:00]. "Peace" in this context is interpreted as Palestine being defeated again [03:40:00]. The two-state solution, advocated by many, including Russia and China, is considered neither rational nor honest [03:40:00].

A two-state solution would mean Palestinians living under Israeli military and economic control in a very narrow area, resembling a concentration camp system or "Bantustans" in South Africa, or Native American reservations in the US [03:40:00]. This would condemn them to an economically unworkable, closed, isolated, and completely Israel-dependent existence [03:40:00].

The speaker sees two main possibilities for resolution:
1.  **Palestinian defeat and cleansing:** Gaza would be "cleaned up" and flattened, and the West Bank would lose further autonomy and be weakened, leading to Palestinian defeat [04:00:00]. This outcome is given a 50-50 chance [04:00:00].
2.  **Israeli defeat:** If Israel is defeated, the State of Israel would cease to exist [04:00:00]. Hope is expressed that terrible things would not happen to its people [04:00:00]. This scenario draws a parallel to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099, which existed for 84 years, had a unique culture, but was ultimately defeated and destroyed by Saladin's armies [04:00:00]. Many died, some left, and some assimilated [04:00:00]. This historical precedent is seen as a strong possibility for the present [[middle_east_political_tensions_and_scenarios | situation]] [04:00:00].

A permanent solution is believed to be possible only through the elimination of one of the two sides as a political entity, not necessarily through population massacres [04:00:00]. The coexistence of a Palestinian and an Israeli political formation is deemed difficult at this stage [04:00:00].

### Call for War
The speaker suggests that what is needed is not peace, as peace implies accepting the status quo and bowing to difficulty [03:40:00]. Instead, what is needed is "war" to break the existing order, which is seen as unsustainable [03:40:00].

The phrase "crusade against terrorism," used by figures like Bush, is compared to "jihad" in the Islamic world, carrying similar emotional weight [04:00:00]. It is argued that the Western world, particularly the European Union, is currently in "mortal fear" and is being defeated, though they may not fully realize it [04:00:00]. Instances like France's ban on pro-Palestine demonstrations, followed by large protests, indicate a failing political system and a lost political class [04:00:00].

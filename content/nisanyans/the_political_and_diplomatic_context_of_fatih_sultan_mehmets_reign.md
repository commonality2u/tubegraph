The portrayal of rulers in historical accounts, including [[Fatih Sultan Mehmets intellectual reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]], is often characterized by stereotyped sentences and eulogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This practice was common for Roman emperors, Byzantine emperors, Abbasid caliphs, and medieval Turkish states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Historians would craft narratives to either idealize or condemn a sultan, depending on political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

These official histories often present an "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" attitude towards the Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Towards the end of his rule, [[Fatih Sultan Mehmets intellectual reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] was not a beloved Sultan and was identified with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He ruthlessly suppressed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property and executing many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

More detailed information about [[Fatih Sultan Mehmets intellectual reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] comes from [[historical_sources_about_fatih_sultan_mehmet | Byzantine historians]] such as Halkondylis and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. These individuals lived during his time, met him personally, and were aware of the situation within his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. However, their writings, though often praising the Sultan, carried political agendas and ulterior motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Context and Agendas

The period of [[Fatih Sultan Mehmets intellectual reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]]'s reign was marked by highly complex world politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The Ottoman state was not isolated but engaged in intense relations with various imported states, particularly those in Italy, such as Genoa and Venice, which were often at war with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Byzantine historians like Halkondylis and Ducas were deeply aware of the political situations in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Within the framework of emerging global balances, they sought to defend Italian interests and facilitate alliances or rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This explains why some historical accounts use "cliché expressions" to portray [[Fatih Sultan Mehmets intellectual reputation | Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] akin to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Claims about him knowing Latin and Italian, or being aware of Christianity, should be critically examined not for their truth, but for the underlying reasons they were stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Historical Verification

The accuracy of statements about sultans and state administrators is difficult to ascertain, especially when considering the political motivations behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Whether a statement is in favor or against a ruler, the historian must question the intent behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. These accounts often contain cliché, ready-made phrases, such as describing a ruler as "very religious" or "secretly praying to God," or even attributing architectural drawings to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

It is challenging to discern the truth of such statements, as information about rulers is often disseminated through controlled channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. After 500 years, obtaining a realistic and objective picture from the existing literature becomes exceedingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

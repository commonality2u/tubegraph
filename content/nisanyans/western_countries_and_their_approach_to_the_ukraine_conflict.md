The "Moscow incident" is characterized as a tragic event where over 100 people were killed and many injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While it appears to be an act of hostility, the speaker finds this explanation unconvincing as a direct expression of hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Such a dangerous operation would require significant intelligence involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Instead, the [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Moscow incident]] is viewed as a link in a two-year chain of provocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Escalation as a Goal

The primary aim of these provocations seems to be to compel Russia to react aggressively and angrily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, thereby escalating the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The expectation is that Russia will respond disproportionately, perhaps by destroying Kiev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Examples of these provocations include:
*   Bombings targeting civilians in Belgorod on the Russian border, which lack military purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Two attempts to demolish the Crimean Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   The bombing of an apartment building in Moscow by an unmanned aerial vehicle months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The overarching motive for these actions appears to be to escalate the war and elicit an emotional reaction from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Western Alliance's Official Stance

Despite these provocations, the official stance of Western countries, including America and Western Europe, does not align with this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alilances | Western alliance]] believes the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine War]] is already lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, possibly since January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. They recognize that there is no path to victory for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, and their financial, industrial, and military support has not yielded the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Defeat is perceived as imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The West's primary concern is that a sudden, massive Russian attack leading to the occupation of Kiev would be a disaster for the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Western alliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. They have made significant financial, monetary, and diplomatic investments in this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. A clear defeat would make it very difficult for [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] and the European Union to continue their functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Such a defeat for [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] would cause all countries, especially U.S. allies, to question their trust in America's power and review their foreign policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The West deeply fears a collapse ending the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Intimidation and Bluffing Tactics

For over a year, Western policies have aimed to intimidate Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. An example is the widely publicized, months-long announcement of a Ukrainian counter-attack in the summer of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This public declaration served not as a surprise military tactic, but to dissuade Russia from launching its own major offensive and encourage it to strengthen defensive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

More recently, major Western spokespeople have been making statements about preparing for a "Great World War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The speaker asserts that these statements do not reflect real planning, as the Western world does not desire war, knowing it would lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Instead, they are bluffs designed to warn Russia against a major attack, conveying a message of potential irrationality and willingness to start a World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Desired Outcome for the West

The desired outcome for the [[the_current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_the_us_europe_and_russia | Western alliance]] is for the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_analysis | Ukraine War]] to drag on indefinitely, without significant incidents or developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Their hope is that public interest will wane, allowing the war to end eventually, even in Ukraine's defeat, without public notice or concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. They do not want Russia to launch a swift, major attack that would collapse Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, a logic which Russia seems to accept to some extent, despite its military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Who Wants Escalation?

The [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Moscow incident]] raises questions about who truly desires escalation, given the official Western stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. While Western leaders (e.g., [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_nato_involvement | NATO]] Secretary General, EU Council President, French President, German Chancellor, U.S. Foreign Minister) collectively push the message of deterring a large Russian attack through perceived "craziness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, other actors or perhaps even elements beyond their control might be trying to provoke Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Potential instigators include:
*   State institutions or "adventurous elements" within excessively large, uncontrollable state institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   One or more Western alliance member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   Organized groups in Ukraine that have lost rational thought, likened to the Nazi Party in the final days of World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   Armed and military forces within Ukraine with differing views on policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   Western militia forces and "massacre tourists" who have joined the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. These individuals or organized groups, sometimes called "volunteer Akıncıs" (akin to Ottoman raiders) rather than mercenaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, find war an attractive prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The extent to which they act under Western government control or independently is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   The speaker dismisses ISIS as the culprit for the [[moscow_incident_and_its_implications_on_russia_and_ukraine | Moscow incident]], calling Western governments' unanimous blame on ISIS "ridiculous" and "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Propaganda and Misinformation

The speaker observes a pattern of "nonsense theories" and "propaganda talking points" being spread, particularly intensified during the Covid pandemic and the [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including_the_ukraine_and_gaza | Gaza War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. These lies, often with a lifespan of about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, are not meant to be believed but to confuse the public's mind and destroy their ability to think rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This deliberate obfuscation makes rational discussion on important issues impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Despite the provocations, Russian leadership, specifically Putin, has maintained a "measured speech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, engaging in a "chess" game rather than reacting impulsively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

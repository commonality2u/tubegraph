[[Global political dynamics and conflicts | Geopolitical tensions]] between the United States and China are a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A notable event involving these tensions was a 100-year-old individual (implicitly Henry Kissinger) taking a 10-hour plane ride to China for a serious political meeting concerning the fate of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Information regarding the specifics of this meeting was not disclosed to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Within the American administration, there are "one or two very rare people" whom the Chinese trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This trust stems from this individual's role as the architect of peace between China and the United States in 1972-73, when he served as the national security advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He is also credited as the "founding father" of the United States' transformation that led to its separation from its alliance with the Soviets and subsequent close cooperation with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

For the past year and a half, this individual has strongly asserted that America's Russia policy is flawed, viewing the conflict in Ukraine as a significant diplomatic blunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He continues to highlight the dangers of a radical deterioration in relations with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Economic Battlefield: Dollar Bonds

The primary battleground between the United States and China is observed to be the "dumping of dollar bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. China holds American debt in the trillions of dollars, acquiring US bonds as reserves and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Over recent months and the past year, China has systematically begun divesting itself of these bonds, a process many other countries have also initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

This divestment is anticipated to lead to a massive financial crisis quickly, potentially causing the American economy and the dollar to collapse when a critical threshold is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. An alliance comprising [[the_current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_the_us_europe_and_russia | Russia]], China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Iran is systematically working towards this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Threat of War

Such actions, where China could collapse the dollar, are deemed unacceptable by the United States and could serve as a "real cause for war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The speaker asserts that if China were to collapse the dollar, the only response from the US would be war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, it's considered unlikely that China would act so imprudently without careful consideration of consequences or without managing the process effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Nonetheless, there is a very serious crisis at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The visit of the 100-year-old statesman to China is seen as an effort to resolve or soften this crisis, or perhaps to convey veiled threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

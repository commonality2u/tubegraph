The **Armenian Genocide** refers to the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman government between 1915 and 1923, during and after World War I. April 24 is recognized globally, and especially in Armenia, as the [[Commemoration of the Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide commemoration day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. On this day, the population of Yerevan walks to the genocide monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Events of April 24, 1915

April 24, 1915, marks a critical political step immediately preceding the genocide itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, approximately 235 to 250 prominent Ottoman Armenian intellectuals, including writers, thought leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters, were arrested in Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. They were collected from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. A few days later, they were sent to two locations in Anatolia: one group to Ayaş and another to Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Only 3-4 individuals managed to escape; the rest were killed and never heard from again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

This operation was a political collapse, akin to methods seen frequently in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The state profiled and collected information on individuals, then suddenly rounded them up, regardless of guilt or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly opposed to extremist nationalist Armenian movements, and others who had no involvement in any organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Similar arrests of leading figures occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, Yozgat, and Sivas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. In Sivas, prominent figures were called to the governor's office, taken into a room, killed, and their bodies thrown into carts outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

The objective of this "cleaning" was to silence political leaders and influential individuals within the Armenian community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Following these arrests, starting in May, Armenian civilians, including children, were deported across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This gradually escalated into a process of mass murder and massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Classification as Genocide

Denying the [[Armenian Genocide]] is considered either complete ignorance of history or immorality, often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. The speaker states that there is no question about this, as everyone in the world, except for Turkey (including Arabs, Pakistanis, Azeris, Russians, and Westerners), acknowledges it as an obvious fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

The Turkish state, driven by panic or other reasons, began to design a genocide project as early as 1895 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. From 1913 onwards, the infrastructure for this project was consciously and systematically prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. In 1915, the Turkish state implemented this plan with a systematic and conscious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. The aim was to eliminate the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

The speaker highlights that the Union and Progress regime, which came to power by overthrowing Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1908, initially had an optimistic approach to solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. However, after a year or two, by 1909-1910, they began to return to Abdulhamid's project and mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. After the Adana incidents of 1909, the Union and Progress Party changed its mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. By 1910 or 1911, they concluded that a new Turkish state could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

In 1913, when the Union and Progress cadres regained power, the conditions for the 1915 events were fully prepared and consciously and resolutely implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>. The project to cleanse Anatolia of its non-Muslim population was easier for Greeks due to mutual population exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. However, there was no place for Armenians to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>. Deporting Armenians to Russia or Armenia, while the Ottoman Empire was fighting Russia, would have been disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. It was clear that if the Ottoman Empire was defeated in WWI, eastern provinces like Erzurum and Van would be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.

The decision was made to exile Armenians to Syria, with orders to "do whatever they wanted," which quickly turned into a massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. This was seen as the only solution because, after the war, Armenians would demand compensation for their lands and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. Hundreds of thousands were killed to prevent these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>.

## Turkish State's Policy and [[International reactions and attitudes towards the Armenian Genocide | International Reactions]]

Until 1975, the Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the [[Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. They did not engage in discussions, believing it unnecessary to express an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. Leaders like Atatürk, İnönü, and Menderes, even the May 1927 regime, refrained from official statements on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. It was generally believed in the Western world that Turkey held a high reputation before the 1960s, leading to a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

The [[Armenian Genocide]] re-entered the global agenda in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union, specifically Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. While voices were raised in Turkey, the government preferred a policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

A major turning point came in 1975, shortly after Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Suddenly, the issue of the [[Armenian Genocide]] erupted in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. An organization named ASALA emerged, conducting attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. This was followed by a sudden remembrance of the Armenian Genocide in the Western press as one of the 20th century's biggest crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

Turkey responded with a denial policy, hoping to weather the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Key architects of this denial policy included Cem Coşkun Kırca, Aktar, and Foreign Ministry officials, notably Kamuran İnan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. This systematic and vigorous denial, claiming "such a thing did not happen," became a stance from which Turkey could not retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:04]</a>.

After 1974, Turkey's international standing declined, losing the protection it previously enjoyed in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. The Cyprus incident seriously damaged Turkey's relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. A strong anti-Turkey sentiment emerged in America, France, England, and other Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Turkey's denial of its past crimes was perceived as shameless and rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. This created an excuse to provoke and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Future Outlook

From 2005 to 2011-2012, a "window of hope" opened, suggesting Turkey might abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. There was a growing attitude, even within mainstream media and Islamic broadcasting, to "face it and let this incident pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. For the first time, the [[Armenian Genocide]] was openly discussed in Turkey, with many sane individuals acknowledging the terrible events that destroyed millions of Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. This was seen as a matter of conscience, but Turkey could not officially take this step, despite private individuals expressing such views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

The speaker believes that if Turkey had confronted the issue, it would have relieved a heavy burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. Such a move could also help Armenian society overcome the "obsession" of carrying this heavy burden for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

The speaker, a Turkish citizen, aimed for Turkey to confront the issue for its own sake, believing it would help Turkey overcome its "diseases" and become a healthier society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. However, by 2014-2015 (the centennial), the speaker felt that society's ability to carry the mourning of painful events from 107 years ago had reached a limit, leading to an "exaggeration of moral and mental balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.

### [[Historical context of the Armenian Genocide]] and [[Political and social implications of the Armenian Genocide]]

The [[Armenian Genocide]] is deemed the most important social and political event of the century-long period of Sultan Abdulhamid II and his heirs, the Union and Progress regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. It fundamentally changed the composition of Turkey's society, its political transformation, structures, and its psychological and economic foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. The cleansing of the Greek and Assyrian populations also contributed to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. This idea of ethnic cleansing had been discussed and defended since the 1890s, during Abdulhamid's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>.

The speaker argues that denying the [[Armenian Genocide]] is not a crime, but rather a sign of ignorance or immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. He suggests that for a healthier and calmer discussion, all sides, including Balkan and Western countries, need to analyze the motivations and goals of the rational players involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>. However, refusal to engage in such discussion perpetuates the deadlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>.

For suggested readings on the [[Armenian Genocide]], the speaker recommends "Forty Days of Musa Dagh" as an important novel for understanding the human reality of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:33">[01:48:33]</a>. He also suggests looking at the catalogs of Belge Publications and Communication, which offer many good books on the topic, and works by Fethiye Çetin and the memoirs of Australian Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>.

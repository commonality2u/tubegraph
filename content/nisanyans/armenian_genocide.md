April 24th is globally recognized as [[armenian_genocide_commemoration_and_april_24th | Armenian Genocide Commemoration Day]], especially in Armenia, where it is a highly emotional event with the entire city population participating in walks to the genocide monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Events of April 24, 1915

April 24, 1915, marks a political step that immediately preceded the genocide itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. On the night of April 24, 1915, in Istanbul, Erzurum, and across the country, prominent Armenian intellectuals, including writers, thought leaders, politicians, members of parliament, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, poets, and painters – between 235 and 250 individuals – were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They were collected from their homes, streets, and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A few days later, they were sent to two locations in Anatolia, Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Only 3-4 people managed to escape; the rest were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This was a political collapse operation, where the state profiles and collects information, then suddenly arrests and removes individuals, regardless of guilt or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly against extremist nationalist Armenian movements, and others with no organizational involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Similar arrests of leading societal figures occurred in Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In Sivas, leading figures were called to the governor's office, taken into a room one by one, killed, and thrown into carts outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The intent of this "cleaning" operation was to silence political leaders and influential people in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Following this, starting in May, civilians, including children, were deported across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This incident then escalated into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## [[turkeys_historical_and_political_stance_on_the_armenian_genocide | Turkey's Historical and Political Stance]]

The speaker states that denying the genocide is either complete ignorance or immorality, often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It is an obvious fact recognized by almost everyone globally, except the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The Turkish state, from around 1895, slowly designed a genocide project and consciously and systematically prepared its infrastructure from 1913 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. In 1915, this project was put into practice by the Turkish State with a systematic and conscious approach, aiming to eliminate the non-Muslim population of Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Until 1975, the Turkish state maintained a policy of silence regarding the genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They did not deem it necessary to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Up until 1965, the Republic of Turkey and its representatives were aware of the genocide but chose not to speak on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This policy of silence continued through the periods of Atatürk, İnönü, and Menderes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The genocide gained international agenda again in 1965, initiated by the Soviet Union, specifically Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Although voices were raised in Turkey, the state preferred a policy of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This was possibly due to Turkey's high reputation in the Western world before the 1960s, leading to a consensus not to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Shift to Denial Policy

The shift to denial started around 1975, following Turkey's Cyprus operation in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. After this, an organization called ASALA emerged and began attacking Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Suddenly, the Armenian Genocide was "remembered" in the Western press as one of the 20th century's biggest crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Turkey's response was a "stupid" denial policy, believing it could weather the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This denial policy, orchestrated by figures like Cem Coşkun Kırca, Aktar, and Foreign Ministry officials like Kamuran İnan, became a systematic, large-scale assertion that "such a thing did not happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This strategy was clear from 1975 to be a fiasco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### [[consequences_of_denying_the_armenian_genocide | Consequences of Denial]]

After 1974, Turkey's standing in the international arena plummeted, and its relations with the West deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The denial of past crimes, which the whole world knew, was seen as "shamelessness" and "rudeness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This "stupid policy" created an excuse to provoke and harm Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. For 45-47 years, Turkey could not abandon this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

From 2005 to 2011-2012, a "window of hope" appeared for Turkey to abandon this "conscientious hump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. During this period, the genocide was openly discussed in Turkey, with many sane individuals from both the right and left acknowledging it as a terrible event, even if not explicitly using the term "genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They recognized that "millions of Armenians... were shaped and destroyed" and that Turkey would be harmed by its denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. However, Turkey failed to take this step officially, though many individuals were willing to speak out privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

Confronting the issue would greatly relieve Turkey of a "heavy burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The Armenian society has carried a "very heavy hump" for 107 years, and acknowledging the genocide might be a way for them to overcome this obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The speaker himself struggled on this issue until 2014, wanting Turkey to confront it for its own societal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_armenian_genocide | Historical Context]] and Reasons

The genocide is considered the most important social and political event of the century-long period from Sultan Abdulhamid to the Union and Progress regime and into the republican period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. It fundamentally changed the color, composition, political transformation, and structures of Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Its psychological and economic basis is the genocide incident, including the cleansing of the Greek and Assyrian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This idea of ethnic cleansing was conceived and defended since the 1890s, during the time of Abdulhamid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

The Union and Progress regime initially had an optimistic approach after overthrowing Abdulhamid in 1908, believing they could solve these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. However, by 1909-1910, they had to return to the Abdulhamid "project" and "mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. It seems they reached the conclusion by 1910-1911 that a "new Turkish Turkey" could not be established without the elimination of non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. After being shaken by the Balkan War in 1912, the Union and Progress cadres, upon returning to power in 1913, consciously and resolutely implemented the project of cleansing Anatolia from its non-Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

The cleansing of Greeks was relatively easier due to mutual population exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, where Greeks from Turkey could settle in areas vacated by Turks in Macedonia and other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. However, there was no designated place for Armenians to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. Deporting them to Russia or Armenia, while the Ottoman Empire was fighting a life-and-death struggle against Russia, would mean "giving material to the enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Given the high probability of defeat in World War I and the potential loss of eastern provinces, the idea emerged to exile Armenians to Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Ultimately, it was concluded there was no solution other than "cleansing" or "massacre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. This was done to prevent demands for compensation and the return of lands and assets after the war, regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

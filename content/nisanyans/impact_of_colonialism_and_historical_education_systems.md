## Impact of Colonialism
The reality of colonialism is not possible to reduce to a simple "black and white" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. In the past, no one in countries where British and French colonialism dominated, such as African countries, India, Middle Eastern countries, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Vietnam, argues that colonialism was a good thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### British Rule in India
British rule in India can be divided into two main periods:
*   **First Century (Starting 18th Century)**: This period is described as a "disgrace" and "robbery" with no other purpose than plundering India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. At that time, India was likely the richest country in the world in terms of economic development, trade volume, luxury production and consumption, and population, potentially even richer than Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. The actions during this century were "armed robbery" that "destroyed" and "ruined India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This initial phase was operated by a private company on behalf of the English ruling classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Second Century (After 1850)**: The British government took over the administration of India around 1856 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Recognizing that pure exploitation was unsustainable, they began to protect infrastructure, provide [[Education system and its roles | education]], and raise an educated local group loyal to the British who knew English for second-level jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. These investments were made with a clear goal of financial return for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

### The Rise of Anti-Colonialism
The new [[Education system and its roles | education system]] and school networks established by the British in India taught their values valid in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. This led to a natural consequence: the first generation of educated locals questioned why they couldn't govern their own country if the British could govern theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. The leaders of ancient colonial movements were often people who received Western education, adopted contemporary Western ideas, and understood the logical consequences of these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.

### Mandates and Post-War Arrangements
The idea that a mandate (colonialism) would benefit some countries is dismissed as "no such story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. For Turkey, after its defeat in World War I, the idea of colonization or coming under the rule of a Western country was never seriously on the agenda because Turkey had been an empire for hundreds of years with political integrity and a governing elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

However, a mandate project was put forward for Turkey, suggesting a rich country becoming a nation-state could have a consultant in each ministry for a period, directing tax policies and re-establishing the system under a state's supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. This was proposed to be given to the United States as a neutral, weak, and distant power, rather than England or France, to avoid major conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. Some intellectual circles in Turkey considered this, but America ultimately rejected the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

In contrast, Arab countries like Syria and Iraq were torn apart after the war, primarily due to oil resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. These regions had not been states for 800 years and lacked an administration, staff, national consciousness, or schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

### The Nablus Defeat and Secret Agreements
The modern [[The role of historical narratives in contemporary society | history]] of Turkey is suggested to begin with the Ottoman defeat in Nablus in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35]">[01:38:35]</a>. This defeat, where the Ottoman 7th and 8th armies were surrounded and captured by the British, is seen as a "staged fight" or a necessary, pre-negotiated surrender due to the Ottoman army's exhaustion and the Germans' dwindling support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24]">[01:35:24]</a>. The gain for Turkey in return for this surrender operation is speculated to be today's Turkey-Syria border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57]">[01:37:57]</a>, implying a secret agreement where the British would not advance beyond the Turkish ethnic border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16]">[01:38:16]</a>. The lack of detailed information on this agreement in modern Turkish and British historiography is deemed suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57]">[01:39:57]</a>.

## Historical Education Systems
In ancient Anatolia, specifically the Turabdin region, a significant writing culture existed 600 years ago, as evidenced by texts like *kainane* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18]">[00:10:18]</a>. This culture did not form in a vacuum; it was supported by institutions where people learned to read and write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10]">[00:12:10]</a>.

### The Role of Monasteries
[[The role of monastic institutions in historical education | Monasteries]] were the primary institutions providing this [[Education system and its roles | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26]">[00:12:26]</a>. Young, talented children were given to monasteries, where they grew up, learned to write, and produced huge volumes of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42]">[00:12:42]</a>. Writing was considered a profession and an art, requiring an institution and organization to teach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00]">[00:13:00]</a>.

These monasteries, even during the Islamic rule period (15th and 16th centuries), were not always large or rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23]">[00:13:23]</a>. However, they had a community of five to 150 people and a stable source of income to sustain them, as an institution cannot function without economic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13]">[00:14:13]</a>. The most successful institutional structure in the history of Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and the Middle East geography is concluded to be the [[The role of monastic institutions in historical education | monastic structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38]">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Decline and Modern Attempts
After the Islamic conquest, monastic institutions gradually became obsolete, losing their function, wealth, lands, and economic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49]">[00:15:49]</a>. Nothing of equal strength could be established in their place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15]">[00:16:15]</a>. The equivalent institution in the Islamic world, the lodge, was effective in the early period (13th-14th centuries) but never reached the vitality of the monastery and degenerated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22]">[00:16:22]</a>. This decline led to a cultural void, where old Christian institutions died and new structures for the modern age could not be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51]">[00:16:51]</a>.

The Åžirince project, including the mathematics village, took inspiration from historical monastic models to create a modern structure that can meet the needs of contemporary Turkey in a secular world, fostering a similar culture outside traditional Christian theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21]">[01:19:21]</a>. The project highlights the significant deficiency in modern society caused by the decline of the foundation tradition, leading to difficulties in establishing and sustaining non-profit institutions dedicated to something other than making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01]">[02:22:01]</a>.

### Robert College and Modern Education
Robert College, an elite American school, was established to train Turkey's administrative cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24]">[00:56:24]</a>. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it became a significant hub for Marxist militants, including young people from prominent Turkish families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45]">[00:56:45]</a>. This political militancy subsided by the mid-1970s, especially with the integration of girls and the school's relocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00]">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Contemporary Criticisms of Western Education and Society
A critical perspective on contemporary Western society and its [[Education system and its roles | education system]] suggests that Western societies have taken a path that "cannot be explained by any rational thing," bordering on madness and a period of "suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16]">[01:48:16]</a>. This includes concerns about:
*   The pervasive presence of LGBT culture in public spaces, media, and children's content, with examples from Berlin, Netflix, Disney, and children's books in the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44]">[01:44:44]</a>.
*   The boycotting of films like "Sound of Freedom" (about child kidnapping) by Hollywood, labeling them as conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01]">[01:47:01]</a>.
*   The targeting and "brainwashing" of children by "vile types of people" who have taken over [[Role of Universities and Education | educational institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03]">[01:47:03]</a>.
*   The perceived "redesigning" of sexuality, food, and diet by the West, leading to mental health and drug addiction epidemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45]">[01:47:45]</a>.

It is questioned whether this situation is a consequence of Western society's abandonment of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18]">[01:49:18]</a>. The argument is made that traditional religions have lost credibility over the last 500 years, especially the last 200, as their explanations of the world were superseded by science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12]">[01:51:12]</a>. Unlike Western religions, Eastern religions with more flexible theology and less rigid "bookish" structures have adapted better to the modern world and new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26]">[01:53:26]</a>. The decline of institutions like the Church, which historically served as a moral objection to the state, especially during events like the Covid crisis, highlights a loss of traditional discipline and moral guidance in Western societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29]">[01:55:29]</a>.

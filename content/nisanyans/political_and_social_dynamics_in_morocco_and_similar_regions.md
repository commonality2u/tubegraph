## Impressions and Travel in Morocco

Marrakech is described as a very colorful, lively, and sympathetic country with friendly people, though this experience might be due to luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Under normal conditions, alcohol and wine are not served, but hotels are privileged to offer it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

A journey through Morocco included Marrakech, then south towards Berberistan, visiting castles of old feudal lords, and reaching cities like Varzazat and Zagora, where "heavy African air" was felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Impact of the September 2023 Earthquake
Traveling the mountainous road from Marrakech southwards, particularly a route recommended by the speaker's son Arsen, revealed a terrible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The main epicenter of a large earthquake in September was along this road, in the mountainous region south of Marrakech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Approximately 40 villages and two large towns along the way were completely destroyed, leveled to the ground with no buildings left standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Seven months later, people are still living in tents or containers, with seemingly no movement to rebuild their lives, presenting "terrifying scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The Bazaar of Marrakech is considered the most colorful and beautiful of oriental bazaars, an "incredible endless labyrinth" of "colorful excitement," though it can be tiring to navigate through the crowds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Cultural Similarities in Islamic Cities]]

A question is posed regarding the similar city architecture and culture found in Marrakesh and distant cities like Samarkand and Bukhara, questioning how Islamic civilization established such cultural hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Key similar elements across Islamic cities, including Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Urfa, Mardin, Baghdad, and Iranian cities, are identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>:
*   **The Market/Bazaar**: An "indispensable basic institution" characterized by narrow, labyrinthine streets with many small shops, often organized by profession, selling both handicrafts and industrial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Non-figurative Arts**: Highly developed art styles based on "continuous repetition of abstract figures," decorative and colorful, avoiding the depiction of nature and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This is seen as a "very clearly Islamic" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **The Mosque**: Serving as the "basic regulators of natural life" and the central event of prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

These three factors have shaped a vast geography, covering "almost one third of the old world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While the bazaar's pre-Islamic existence is uncertain, its preservation in this form is unique to Islamic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## [[historical_discussions_of_berber_and_arab_identities | Berber Identity and Arabization]] in Morocco

The local Berber population in Morocco initially resisted Islamic rule for centuries when the Arabs arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. However, later dynasties and rulers of Morocco, although often of native Berber origin, "boasted of being of Arab origin and being more Muslim than everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

When Berber principalities sought to establish states and dominate broader regions, they consistently adopted "Arab culture, Arab identity and the Islamic religion as their flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This is because Arab and Islamic identity became the "symbol of civilization" and the "tool" to gain submission beyond one's own tribe or small geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

For instance, the significant empires established in the last 1000 years, dominating all of West Northwest Africa (Algeria, Tunisia) and Spain, originated from small-scale Berber areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Upon becoming empires, their leaders invariably claimed descent from figures like Haz Ali or Hasan, asserting their status as "sherifs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This illustrates the role of Islam and Arab dominance as conditions for large-scale sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Comparison to [[comparisons_between_cultural_and_modern_elements_in_morocco_and_trkiye | Turkey]]
There are "great similarities" between Morocco's history and [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkey]]'s micro-history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Just as Turkish rulers claimed Turkish and Muslim identity, Moroccan rulers claimed Arab and Muslim identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. In Turkey, lineages often trace back to Khorasan, while in Morocco, they trace back to Mecca or Medina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Being Arab has become a "complementary element of being Muslim," used as a cultural and political tool, similar to how Turkishness and Muslimness are used in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### State Structure Differences
A significant difference from the Ottoman Empire is the permanence and sophistication of its state organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Moroccan dynasties were temporary, constantly facing legitimacy challenges and rebellions upon a new ruler's ascent or a sultan's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. The Moroccan state would "completely disintegrate every 30-40 years or at the latest every 100 years" before gathering again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

In contrast, the Ottomans had a stable dynasty for 600 years with an institutional structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This dominance was particularly strong in Western Anatolia and Rumelia, areas influenced by Byzantine political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The Ottoman core, centered in Istanbul, possessed a distinct structure, attributable to its Byzantine tradition and heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. However, the eastern parts of the Ottoman Empire, with Kurdish and Arab principalities, historically resembled the unstable political structure of Morocco, with frequent rebellions against tax collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Ottoman Imperial Ambitions and [[middle_eastern_geopolitical_tensions | Global Political Dynamics]]

The Ottomans attempted to establish sovereignty in Algeria in the 16th century, though their formal administrative structure did not fully take hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Local rulers submitted, and the Ottomans even captured Fez and Marrakech twice, holding onto Morocco for brief periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

The primary motivation for these efforts was a "desperate" search for an Atlantic port, an "exit to the Atlantic Ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. The Ottomans, having become masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and central to medieval trade routes between China, India, and Europe, faced a crisis when the axis of world trade shifted towards the Atlantic and Indian Oceans due to European maritime successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

During the mid-16th century (Sokollu Mehmet Pasha's time, Sultan Suleiman's last years, and Selim II's/Murat III's reigns), the Ottoman Empire ambitiously sent fleets to the Red Sea, Ethiopia, Abyssinia, and Gujarat (India) to fight the Portuguese and establish commercial/military relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Concurrently, they sent an army via Algeria to establish a base on the Atlantic coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Both these grand projects, aimed at securing a share in new world trade routes, ended in "big fiascos," with the Ottomans withdrawing from Morocco after a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This failure contributed to the "great collapse of the Ottoman Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

Despite these historical attempts, there is "great admiration for the Ottoman Empire and TÃ¼rkiye" in the entire Arab world, viewing Turkey as a "rich relative" and the "whitest Muslim country" (not counting Tatars, Bosnians, Albanians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. This perception has a racial element, though Islamic world is not typically seen as racist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

In the 17th century, Morocco's Alawite dynasty imitated the Ottomans, establishing a professional army with Turkish commanders and officers, and using the Turkish title "Pasha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. This title persisted, seen in historical figures like Ba Ahmet Pasha, a black African prime minister and dictator, whose palace and a street in Marrakech bear the "Pasha" name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

## [[impact_of_historical_colonial_influences_on_modernday_morocco | Western Sahara (The Green March)]]

In the 1980s, Spain decided to withdraw from its colony, Western Sahara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>. Morocco claimed the territory as its own homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. Instead of a military invasion, Morocco executed a "very smart policy" by forming a civilian invasion force, known as the Green March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. Thousands of unarmed civilians walked into and "invaded that region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>.

Western Sahara still has an "uncertain international status," largely controlled by Morocco, which encourages tourism in its coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>. However, a significant refugee camp-like city formed on the Algerian side of the desert, where most of the people, especially those linked to the Polisario guerrilla organization, escaped after the Moroccan invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>. This situation has "terribly" poisoned relations between Algeria and Morocco, leading to hostility and a lack of diplomatic ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>.

## Broader Socio-Political Dynamics

### Cultural vs. Biological Determinism
The speaker strongly opposes the view that "everything is cultural," asserting that human behaviors, especially sexual behaviors, are largely part of an "innate package, just like animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a>. While language, symbolic thought, and the ability to cooperate based on symbolic beings are unique human capacities, fundamental aspects like birth, childhood, adolescence, sexual life, and death are zoological and biological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>.

He critiques recent "gender and race theories" in the Western world, particularly the claim that sexual behaviors and differences between sexes are purely learned and cultural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:33">[03:03:33]</a>. This is deemed an "absurd idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:46">[03:14:46]</a>. Similarly, while less decisive, differences in character and behavioral patterns exist between races (e.g., black, Chinese, white Northern European) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:52">[03:18:52]</a>. The idea that these are "completely cultural" and can be homogenized through education is also rejected as untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>.

### Wealth Display and Social Criticism
A discussion on a municipality's use of "gold-leafed seats" highlights two types of criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:58">[03:39:58]</a>:
1.  **Criticism of Vulgarity**: The speaker dismisses this, arguing that it's a "cultural superiority show" where critics impose their "modern Italian style" preferences over a "well-mannered contemporary Ottoman style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Historically, "average people" and the "most elite" have been drawn to the glitter of gold as a symbol of wealth and superiority across various cultures (Ottoman, India, China, pre-20th century West) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:18">[03:53:18]</a>. Public spaces like a mayor's hall are meant to be impressive for guests and to project a "bargaining move" of cultural superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:11">[03:54:11]</a>.
2.  **Pseudo-Populist Criticism**: This is seen as ridiculous. Those who politicize such issues by lamenting public poverty while seats are lavishly furnished are actually "humiliating the people and showing that they feel alienated from that people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

### Political Strategy
Success in the political arena hinges on creating the impression of a "reliable person" and strongly conveying reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:10">[03:57:10]</a>.

### Languages and Power Dynamics
The linguistic landscape of regions like Antep (Gaziantep) â Turkish amidst Arabic and Kurdish-speaking areas â is explained by the "dynamics of sobering up and settling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:05">[03:58:05]</a>. Where Kurdish or Arab tribes/principalities dominated, their language became dominant; where Ottoman central bureaucracy or Turkmen principalities dominated, Turkish prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-58:21">[03:58:21]</a>. The language of the "politically dominant bosses" becomes the language of the elite and is learned by those seeking to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:14">[04:00:14]</a>. People are pragmatic, adapting to the language of power to increase social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:35">[04:00:35]</a>. This is exemplified by the Arabization of Morocco, where despite a 95% Berber population, Arabic became the dominant culture and language because Arab rulers were stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:39">[04:01:39]</a>.

### Social Democracy
Social democracy is described as a concept invented in the late 19th century to counter the working class's shift towards revolutionary socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:04">[04:08:04]</a>. Post-1945, Western countries implemented social programs (unemployment, health insurance, limited working hours, public housing) to dilute socialism and improve living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:05">[04:09:05]</a>. While successful for 20-30 years, states began to go bankrupt in the 1970s, leading to the abandonment of social democratic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:40">[04:10:40]</a>. By the 1990s, social democratic parties worldwide faced a crisis, losing credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:27">[04:11:27]</a>. They shifted focus to environmentalism, feminism, and gay rights, which appealed to university graduates, but are now at "the point of exhaustion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:53">[04:11:53]</a>. Thus, the Republican People's Party (CHP) cannot be social democratic, as the concept itself is an "old era" discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:31">[04:12:31]</a>.

Current dominant political platforms are the migration problem and global realignment/alliances (e.g., NATO stance, response to [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | Israel]]/[[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | Ukraine]] crises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:18">[04:13:18]</a>.

### Homosexuality in Ottoman History
During the rise of the Ottoman Empire until the 17th century, pederasty was "extremely common" in elite classes, openly discussed, and featured in poetry and works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:41">[04:14:41]</a>. It was a more common and acceptable expression of sexual desire towards young men than towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:15">[04:15:15]</a>. Sultans had relationships with many young boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:32">[04:15:32]</a>. However, around the Tulip Era (early 18th century), public perception shifted, and sodomy became considered "shameful and detestable," though such practices have historically risen and disappeared in waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:38">[04:15:38]</a>.

### Bisexuality
The speaker agrees that all people have bisexual tendencies, especially at a young age, if not throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:19">[04:26:19]</a>. A large majority choose to suppress these tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Sexual tendencies are not just about pleasure but concern the "reproductive function" of human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:17">[04:27:17]</a>.

### Perversion
Defining perversion as "deviating from the norm," practices like group sex or swingers can be considered perversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:42">[04:28:42]</a>. However, the speaker suggests that "it is necessary to try all kinds of perversions to broaden one's horizons, to enrich one's worldview, to get to know life well, to get to know oneself" within moderate limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:05">[04:29:05]</a>.

During World War I, the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Ottoman Empire]] was embroiled in significant conflict, which saw key figures like Mustafa Kemal in prominent, and at times controversial, roles.

## Mustafa Kemal's Service and Controversies During WWI

Mustafa Kemal was on duty on the Syrian front during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. During this period, he was reportedly involved in "some dark events in the nature of Cemal Pasha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. His name was also connected to a coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Furthermore, he faced accusations of corruption, specifically being accused of selling army horses and pocketing the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

After these accusations, he was pardoned from all his duties and was subsequently "missing for a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This period of inactivity for one of the "most talented and most successful" commanders of the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Ottoman state]] during the "greatest war" and its "hottest days" raises questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. After approximately six months, he was assigned a "very sensitive" and "very serious political task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Appointment as Vahdettin's Political Caretaker

In December 1917, Vahdettin became the new crown prince, succeeding the old crown prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. With Sultan Re≈üad expected to die soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, Vahdettin was sent on a long visit to Germany, which was an ally and protector of the [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Ottoman Empire]] during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Mustafa Kemal was assigned as Vahdettin's "political caretaker" for this visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This was considered a "very sensitive task" and a "very vital task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, especially given that Vahdettin was over 60 years old, had never been involved in politics, and was described as a "shy, cowardly old gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. He was being sent to meet and shake hands with powerful figures like the Emperor of Germany during a "life-or-death war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Mustafa Kemal's Vienna Holiday and Later Actions

In May and June of 1918, during a critical period of the war, Mustafa Kemal was sent on a long holiday and for treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Before going to Karlsbad, he stayed in a hostel in Vienna for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. A diary from this period was notably published, which has been described as containing trivial details such as "I went out in the morning and took a walk. The dog of the hostel owner was barking. I did nothing to him. I did nothing at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Questions arise about why a commander who held "the most important and politically sensitive posts" would be sent on a two-month holiday to Austria during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

Later, after going to Samsun, Mustafa Kemal was perceived to have "played a double game all the way to Amasya and even to Erzurum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Although Vahdettin sent him with a "very important mission" and Damat Ferit Pasha signed the decree, granting him "incredible authority" to go to Anatolia with an important mission, he then "suddenly turn[ed] against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

A significant issue in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] revolves around the quality and role of its educated classes and elites, rather than common misconceptions about the general populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Debunking Misconceptions about the Turkish Populace

Contrary to some assertions, the majority of people in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] are not peasants; the peasant population has fallen below 1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Furthermore, the claim that the people of [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] are uncouth is disputed; on the contrary, they are described as quite well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

While some newly urbanized populations from village culture have faced challenges adapting to city life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the speaker asserts that the real fault lies not with these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Instead, it is attributed to the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_Turkey | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]], which is tasked with guiding the country, presenting ideals, and serving as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Problem of the Educated Classes

The primary issue in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] is identified as the poor education of the educated classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This represents the biggest failure of the Republic of [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] in education: its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Failure of Elite Education

After 1950, the Republic succeeded in providing a minimum level of education to large masses, opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, a society requires more than just basic education for everyone or training civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is crucial to raise an elite group capable of leading society and forming its intellectual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Historically, the only opportunities for elite education in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] came from a few institutions established during the Ottoman period, many by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The Republic did not allow these schools to develop or increase in number; instead, they became smaller, their budgets narrowed, and their scope limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Consequently, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] have steadily declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. High-quality education is now predominantly achieved only by a fortunate minority able to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Those who study abroad often struggle to adapt to conditions in [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] upon their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, thus not adequately fulfilling leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Deficiencies in Domestic Education

Domestic [[educational_system_and_values_in_Trkiye | education system and values in Türkiye]] are described as little more than a "stupid brainwashing program" designed to train civil servants who conform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This system has failed to produce a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Furthermore, elite religious education has also been prevented from proper development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The quality of Islamic religious experts today is said to be abysmal compared to those of the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### The "Half-Educated" Elite

A particular segment of "half-educated Turks" – those who consider themselves white-collar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> – are identified as the "scourge of [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These individuals are characterized by a lack of social responsibility, no instinct to teach or give to others, and a self-serving mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is attributed to the faulty [[educational_system_and_values_in_Trkiye | education system]] that fails to instill a mission of guiding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The speaker also notes a small group of "real elites" (around 50,000 people above the "half-educated" segment) who are terribly alienated from society and whose primary hope is to leave [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_Turkey | Turkey]] as soon as possible, or at least send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This situation is described as a tragedy for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## The Public's Thirst for Knowledge

Despite the shortcomings of the educated classes, the general [[publics_hunger_for_knowledge_and_education_in_Turkey | public's hunger for knowledge and education in Turkey]] is profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. There is a deep respect for scholars among Anatolian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, who listen intently to those perceived as knowledgeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

This thirst for knowledge extends to fundamental issues, especially religious topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Even radical ideas, if explained seriously and lovingly, are met with open minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. People show great curiosity about universal and existential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, as well as topics like [[political_events_and_military_education_in_Turkey | Turkish history]], social structure, the Armenian Genocide, the Kurdish issue, the Syrian issue, and questions about Atatürk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. They absorb such information "as if they found an oasis in the desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The speaker notes that if the "westernized, few in number, and limited in quality" elite cannot provide this intellectual service, the public turns to religious figures like teachers and pilgrims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This enduring [[publics_hunger_for_knowledge_and_education_in_Turkey | hunger for knowledge in Turkey]] remains largely unsatisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

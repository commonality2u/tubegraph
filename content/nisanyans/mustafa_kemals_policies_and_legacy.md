This article explores the policies and enduring legacy of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, based on a discussion from an article reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The discussion attempts to analyze his actions from a practical political standpoint, focusing on the challenges he faced and the long-term impact of his decisions on Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Goals and Initial Policies

Mustafa Kemal's fundamental assumption and goals were twofold:
1.  To re-establish the power of a collapsed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  To protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

These goals were clear from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, aiming to save and rebuild a bankrupt and collapsed state that had suffered significant migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The speaker acknowledges his success in this primary mission, as he maintained power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

## Methods and Justifications

To achieve his objectives, Mustafa Kemal employed several strategies:
*   **National Excitement:** He tried to create national excitement, even if artificial, in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Populist Narratives:** While Istanbul and Izmir elites were perceived as selling out, ordinary citizens were fed stories of homeland, nation, Sakarya, and "infidels poured into the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Political Terror:** Drawing on the tradition of intrigue and political terror from the [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Union and Progress]] organization, he would, if necessary, arrest and hang individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **State Disintegration Measures:** In 1926, counter-deterrent measures were taken to prevent the state's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **International Balancing Act:** In a world uncertain between English and German dominance, he attempted to strike a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Territorial Gains:** Seizing the opportunity when France was perceived to be weakening, he aimed to break off a piece from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the methods chosen were a continuation of a process that had been ongoing since the Tanzimat period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

## Critiques of Later Policies (Post-1929/30)

The speaker questions some of Mustafa Kemal's later actions, implying they might show "signs of madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>:
*   Theories of language and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The Dersim massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The liquidation of İnönü <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The purchase of the Savarona yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   His decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The speaker acknowledges that it is "difficult to protect what you like from the corrupting effect of absolute power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Legacy and Current Impact (Kemalism)

The speaker argues that while Mustafa Kemal skillfully governed the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, his "disciples" today pose a significant problem for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Mustafa Kemal's direct "crime" is seen as contributing to an arrogant and insulting tone as the main axis of Turkish political language, an undeniable share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Critique of Kemalist "Disciples"
Kemalism, particularly the "Kemalist sect," is described as a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This group is seen as having lost emotional communication with the common strata of their own society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> and having no choice but to embrace the state's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. They are portrayed as incapable of understanding the rights of Turks or establishing emotional closeness with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Nationalism and Its Pathology
Nationalism is described as a tool of populism globally, glorifying a people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. However, the Turkish variant, particularly the "Feast of contemporary Turkish racism and state gatekeeping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, fosters a moral blindness that justifies all dishonesty in the name of the state, homeland, and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Kemalism vs. Islam
The Kemalist sect rejects Islamic teachings and positions itself as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This rejection stems from an "arrogance" that deems "we are right; the other is sharpened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, making them unable to understand Turkey's modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### The "Icon" Culture and State Administration
A significant part of Mustafa Kemal's legacy is the pervasive display of his image ("holy icon") in government offices across Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This icon functions as a "back" or shield for civil servants, allowing them to discard normal human logic and conscience in the name of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This attitude is described as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

### Failure of Modernization Project
Despite efforts, the project of raising Turkey to the level of leading contemporary nations was a "complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The secular decline that began in the Ottoman Empire in the 1600s continued unchanged during the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## The İzmir Assassination Attempt and Purges

The speaker discusses the İzmir assassination attempt of 1926, which is questioned as to whether it was real or an excuse to intimidate opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. It is suggested that such alleged plots are common in the lives of dictators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This event was treated as a "blessing from God" and used to purge opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Those purged included old [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Union and Progress]] cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, particularly those who knew the "inner workings of the so-called War of Independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Important figures like Minister of Finance Mr. Cavit, Vasıf Bey, and Kara Kemal Bey, who were crucial in financing and organizing the National Struggle, were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Notably, all seven people who signed the Amasya declaration with Mustafa Kemal, including Kazım Karabekir, Refet Bele, Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and Rauf Orbay, were tried with the death penalty, though none were executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This purge movement is likened to Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## The Savarona Yacht Incident

The purchase of the Savarona yacht is cited as one of the most "despicable and pathetic corruption incidents in modern Turkish history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. It is described as a "chain scam" driven by the "boss's megalomania" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. Atatürk used the ship for about a week while ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>, but İsmet İnönü did not use it, and it fell into disuse for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>, eventually being used as a training ship and reportedly even a "brothel for upper-class customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

## Debate on Necessity and Alternatives

The speaker argues that if someone else had been in Mustafa Kemal's place in 1919 or 1923, "the same things would have happened, more or less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, driven by the objective laws of state governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Governing a state is seen as more science than art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The argument is that the Turkish nation, having been molded into a new identity, would have found a state structure regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

The Ottoman administration in its traditional form effectively ended in 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. The cadres that took over in 1908 were too young and lacked respect for traditional institutions like the sultanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. The speaker highlights that the collapse of old dynasties and the rise of nation-states was a global phenomenon at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Future of Kemalism/Turkey

The speaker believes that a "new and democratic Kemalism," as some young secular academics suggest, is "completely a dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. Kemalism is considered an absurd idea for a totalitarian dictator of the 1930s to become a more democratic symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, something they have failed to achieve for a hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

Turkey's current political landscape is marked by a search for a "new route, a new staffing, a new structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, making a return to Kemalist culture a "very, very distant possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

### Search for a New Ideology
The existing ideologies in Turkey are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   Turgut Özal's globalist capitalist model, attempted in the 1980s, did not suit Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   The Westernization project, pursued under the guise of European Union membership until 2011, also faltered as the EU itself showed signs of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

In the absence of a truly original alternative, Islam has emerged as the idea that unites and defines the country and provides a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. This helplessness and lack of alternatives continue globally, with existing thought systems and political parties proving inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. The speaker suggests that societies are desperately seeking a new "hope" or "way out" beyond the current political offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, a sentiment that also applies to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. The Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, increasingly believes the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is described as an interesting and strange country, particularly in its political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is one of the former [[Yugoslavias Political History | Yugoslav countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Historical Context

The country experienced a terrible civil war and ethnic cleansing, where Muslim Bosnians were expelled from approximately half of Bosnia based on their ethnic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This event is characterized as a genocide, defined as the manifestation of the will to destroy a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. While often attributed solely to figures like Milosevic and "Serbian fascists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, the speaker raises questions about the role of Bosnia's declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

The population is highly intertwined, with villages and towns shared by Muslims, Serbs, and Croats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. There is a 500-year-old memory of conflict, stemming from the Ottoman period where ruling classes were Muslims, and Serbs and Croats were often serfs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. These groups only gained equal citizen status after [[Yugoslavias Political History | Yugoslavia]] was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Declaration of Independence and International Involvement

Bosnia declared independence despite its population being 44% Bosnian, 33% Serb, and a Croatian minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A political movement led by Alija Izetbegović equated Bosnian national identity with Islam, aiming for an independent Bosnia to be governed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This was rejected by Serbs and Croats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The idea of demanding independence for Bosnia as a whole was considered "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The European Union and NATO strongly encouraged this declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The declaration was against the existing constitution as it lacked a two-thirds majority for amendment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Serbs and Croats boycotted the referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

The European Union proposed a solution in March 1992, suggesting 15 cantons where internal administration would be given to Bosnians, some to Croats, and a mechanism for mutual sharing of rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. All three parties signed this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, 10 days later, Alija Izetbegović withdrew his signature after a meeting with the American Ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The war broke out two days after this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Post-War Structure

After three and a half years of war and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, and under the imposition of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, Bosnia and Herzegovina now exists as two states, not one, despite being an "indivisible whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. One half of this republic "belongs to the only ones" (Serbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

There is a border on the map between these two states, but no physical or visible border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Communities are still intertwined, with instances where a municipality building or mosque might be in a different "section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Recent elections highlighted the division, with election posters emphasizing "Serbian homeland" and "Serbian Unity Party" on one side, and "Bosnia and Herzegovina flag" on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This situation is deemed "not a sustainable situation" and "another crime against humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

Sarajevo is described as a "sweet" and "nice" city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, while the "back side" (Serbian side) is much more "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. The speaker encourages spending time on both sides to understand the local psychology and the expression of pain through martyrs' monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This broader perspective is necessary to assess responsibility for the tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

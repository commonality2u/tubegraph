The recent events in Nagorno-Karabakh, also referred to as "Araka" in the discussion, are described as a "great tragedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. The population of Nagorno-Karabakh is now estimated to be almost zero percent, with an estimated 120,000 people having left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. This mass exodus occurred because the residents concluded they could not live under Azeri rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>. The [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | Armenian national existence]] in Nagorno-Karabakh has effectively ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:17">[02:31:17]</a>.

## Diplomatic Maneuvers by Armenia

Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's call for friendship and alliance with America was initially seen as "astonishing, shocking, stupid, incredibly stupid" and even treasonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:58">[02:39:58]</a>. However, upon calmer reflection, these "hasty judgments" were curbed, as the moves were largely symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:23">[02:42:23]</a>.

Actions included:
*   Inviting Americans for a joint military exercise with the Texas National Guard, described as "part-time soldiers" (firefighters, police officers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. This was considered "perception management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>.
*   Announcing recognition of the court that issued the arrest warrant for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>.
*   Pashinyan's wife visiting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. Her visit was made public intentionally, as she is from the [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] of Ukraine and has relatives there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:54">[03:01:54]</a>.

The underlying reasons for these public shows remain unclear, but their "inside and outside must be very different from each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>.

## The 2020 Military Defeat

Armenia suffered a "very heavy military defeat" in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>. Azeri forces were on the verge of occupying all of Nagorno-Karabakh within 48 hours, with no obstacles remaining to stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>. They successfully captured surrounding regions, cutting off Nagorno-Karabakh's connection and communication with Armenia, effectively encircling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. The strategic city of Shusha, an "Eagle's Nest" overlooking the region, was captured, signifying the end of the conflict at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:16">[02:59:16]</a>.

The Russians intervened, stepping in to create a "decent interval" for the situation to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>. It is understood that the Armenian, Turkish, Russian, and Azerbaijani governments knew the situation would progress in this manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:59">[03:01:59]</a>. After 2020, there was no way for Armenia to retain Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:36">[03:03:36]</a>.

## International Recognition and Consequences

Since 1991, the entire world, including Russia, America, the European Union, and Iran, has recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:54">[03:04:54]</a>. Therefore, Azerbaijan's actions, while "inhumane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>, are considered a "domestic security operation" under International Law, similar to Turkey's actions in Dersim in 1938 or the Ağrı rebellion in 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:44">[03:08:44]</a>.

Armenia failed to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue on the international platform and couldn't gain acceptance for its historical and demographic rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. A rational policy would have involved negotiations with Azerbaijan regarding the rights and security of [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. However, Armenia deported approximately 20% of the Azeri population from its own territory in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>. This act "blocked the future of the [[armenian_history_and_relations | Armenians]] who were more in number within Azerbaijan," constituting close to 20% of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:59">[03:12:59]</a>. There was a mutual population exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:15">[03:14:15]</a>.

## Influence of Karabakh Militant Cadres

Since 1991, militant cadres from Upper Karabakh have dominated [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | Armenian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:55">[03:19:55]</a>. These cadres, including former leaders like Kocharyan and Sargsyan (pre-Pashinyan), "squeezed the Armenian domestic politics" and held Armenia "captive for 30 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:42">[03:22:42]</a>. They also had connections with Russia and various sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:18">[03:22:18]</a>. Their continued influence has prevented Pashinyan from taking necessary diplomatic steps in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:59">[03:29:59]</a>.

A potential positive outcome of this "great human tragedy" could be the removal or sidelining of these "old Karabakh militant cadres" from [[armenian_history_and_geopolitics | Armenian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:14">[03:27:14]</a>.

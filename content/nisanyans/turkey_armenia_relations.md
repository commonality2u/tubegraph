## Current State of Trade Relations

Contrary to a common assumption, there are significant trade relations between Turkey and Armenia, with a wide variety of Turkish products readily available in Armenian supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. There is discussion about what might happen if these relations were to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

However, it is a "wrong information" and a "mistake and an assumption" to believe that Armenians are eager for the border with Turkey to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The "vast majority of people in Armenia are not in favor of opening the border with Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Historical and Sociological Context of Armenian Identity and Conversion

Historically, until the 19th century, being Armenian was synonymous with being a member of the Armenian Church within Ottoman and Iranian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. Leaving the religion also meant leaving the nation, often leading to cultural assimilation into Turkish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. This was largely due to the educational system, where religious institutions (mosques, churches, synagogues) served as primary schools, and a child's education was tied to their religious community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. If an Armenian child attended a Muslim school, they would learn Arabic script and Turkish, leading to a shift in language and culture within a generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

From the mid-18th century onwards, with influences from Europe, the traditional definition of Armenian identity faced a serious crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Some Armenians, discontent with the "bigotry" and exploitative "property addiction" of the Armenian Church, converted to Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Later, others adopted Protestantism, representing an even more radical break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. By converting, they were no longer considered Armenians by the traditional definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

In the second half of the 19th century, intellectuals in Istanbul and Tbilisi began efforts to redefine Armenian identity to include Armenians, Catholics, and Protestants on a common platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

### Conversions to Islam

In Eastern Anatolia, particularly among villagers who were frustrated with church taxes and the church's inability to protect them from Kurdish attacks, a significant number of Armenians converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Many joined Sufi orders like the Naqshbandi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. This phenomenon suggests a deep-seated "hostility" towards the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

For example, in the Gevaş Alızanla Bahçe Saray region south of Lake Van, the Armenian population drastically decreased from the 1840s to the 1880s, falling from almost 100% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. This was not due to massacres but widespread conversion, often accompanied by "a deep sense of hostility and emotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Many of those who later participated in the destruction of Armenian churches and the killing of priests in waves of violence (e.g., 1880, 1895, 1915) were understood to have been Armenians a generation prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

## [[Turkeys Historical and Political Stance on the Armenian Genocide | Armenian Genocide]] and Kurdish Involvement

The "Armenian hadiths" are not just the 1915 incident, which is considered the "golden strike" or "final blow" of a "massacre, expulsion, usurpation and collapse process that has been going on for 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>.

Before 1915, the "real tyrant of the Armenians," and the element that caused them to flee their homeland, was often the Kurdish element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>. Kurdish tribal leaders and later sect sheikhs were described as specializing in "killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, usurping their property, burning their churches, and beheading their priests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>. Armenians often sought refuge with the Ottoman state against these Kurdish attacks, viewing the Turks as allies and protectors until the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:43">[01:35:43]</a>.

In 1915, the Turkish state, specifically the Union and Progress administration and Ottoman bureaucracy, consciously and cold-bloodedly carried out a "project of annihilation" to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. They utilized Kurdish lords, their networks, and the Kurdish people as "allies and helpers and subcontractors" due to an existing tradition of massacre and extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. The Turkish state effectively gave permission by saying, "OK friends, you can do whatever you want, the state is behind you... we will not judge anyone for the crimes they have committed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>.

During this period, there was "great hostility towards the Armenian Church rather than the Armenian nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. After the main period of plunder, many Kurds came to realize that they had become exposed to the Turkish state's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.

## [[Change in Kurdish perspective on Armenian issues | Changing Kurdish Perspective]]

In the last 20-30 years, the attitude and approach of Kurds towards the Armenian issue has "radically changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. This is seen as a positive development, and the speaker hopes Turks will also overcome their prejudices and ignorance like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

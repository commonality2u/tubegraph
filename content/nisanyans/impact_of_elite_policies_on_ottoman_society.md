## Introduction

The discussion on the Ottoman Empire often brings forth differing views on its history, particularly concerning its later periods. Some view it as a glorious past, while others portray it as a bigoted country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The prevailing image of the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, particularly in television series, is often described as a strange, militaristic, aggressive conquest, appealing to the religious common people of today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, this image has little to do with the reality of the 19th century, and even less with the 17th or 18th centuries, which were very different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A key question arises: was the Ottoman culture truly bigoted, conservative, and introverted, or was it a flexible culture with adaptable characteristics? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

## Ottoman History in Three Periods

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] can be broadly discussed in three distinct periods, which are not very similar to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Period of Establishment and Early Success

The first period was characterized by the establishment of an empire with incredible speed and dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The Ottomans introduced a new type of Islamic Empire, full of innovations outside the Islamic culture of the time, and this model was extraordinarily successful for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Within a very short time, an empire was established that stretched from Bursa to Vienna, Basra, and the south of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It was described as a "slave Empire" due to its extremely strong central control, with the economy coming under state control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

This model was considered extremely rational within its own assumptions, having learned from the failed examples of the Abbasid and Byzantine states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Ottomans systematically and rationally purified themselves from past mistakes to establish a new type of empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### The Inevitable Collapse and Social Destruction (16th-18th Centuries)

Despite its initial success, this highly centralized and fragile model, likened to the Soviet model, almost inevitably led to a great collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The 16th century saw changes in world trade, Europe's rapid technological and economic rise, and population increase, all contributing to the Ottoman Empire's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

The period from the late 15th century (1570s-1580s) until 1918 was one of the longest and most painful destruction stories in world history, a chain of disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean basin, historically among the world's richest and most civilized geographies, turned into a "Stone Age" ruin by the end of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This region became one of the world's poorest, with low employment and literacy rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

#### Economic and Social Collapse

The core reason for this decline was the collapse of the production and management models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The *timar* system, which was the state-controlled production system, collapsed between 1500 and 1590 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Villagers either escaped or stopped paying taxes, leading to mass migrations of agricultural populations to the mountains, turning to animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

This period also saw large-scale plunder by nomadic tribes from Syria, Diyarbakır, Mosul, and Kirkuk into Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Towns lost significant populations, the economy collapsed, and trade circulation plummeted to one-tenth of previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Luxury production ceased, literacy decreased, and uncultivated lands expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. European travelers in the 18th century described [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | Ottoman lands]] as a place of isolation, abandonment, destruction, and poverty, where civilization had ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This was a stark contrast to the early 1500s, when Anatolia and Rumelia were still among the richest and most urbanized regions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

#### The State's Central Control and its Downfall

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman state]] was fundamentally against any organization or structure outside its control that gathered large numbers of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. By the 18th century, this policy led to a power vacuum where feudal lords emerged in almost every town and province across Anatolia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, and Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. These lords, essentially "gangs of looters," lacked the infrastructure of a proper state, with no consistent tax collection, salary systems, or proper governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

An example of this disintegration is the İshak Paşa Palace in Doğubeyazıt, built in the 18th century. It symbolically challenged the central authority, with its grandeur rivaling Topkapi Palace, indicating a shift towards independent local powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### The Period of Reform and Modernization (18th-19th Centuries)

By the early 1800s, the [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | Ottoman Empire]] was clearly heading towards complete collapse and losing its existence as a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This led to a series of crises and a period of reform, starting during the reign of Selim III and continuing through Mahmud II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

The reformist elite recognized that the existing system was unsustainable and sought to re-establish the state based on a new model: Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The idea was to learn European languages, understand the "secret" of their success, and apply it in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This initiated [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization and Westernization]] efforts, which were radical and rare in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

However, these reforms largely failed to achieve their desired goals because they could not go beyond a narrow elite circle in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This elite, numbering in the thousands, attempted to assimilate the culture of a cosmopolitan world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. While significant changes occurred within this narrow perspective (Bosphorus, Beyoğlu, Eminönü), they only partially reflected in the provinces and ultimately led to unforeseen disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### Comparison with Japan and Russia

The failure of [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization]] is often contrasted with the success of similar efforts in Japan and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

*   **Japan:** Had an extremely homogeneous society, with its entire population belonging to the same culture, ideal, state, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. As an island nation, its identity was independently defined by geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Russia:** While an empire, Russia successfully assimilated diverse tribes into a homogeneous culture, forcing a single common culture, ideal, and lifestyle across its vast geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. They managed to make Tatars, Georgians, and Ukrainians accept a basic set of their own culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

In contrast, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] was a union established by conquest and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Its diverse communities fiercely resisted losing their national or religious identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Consequently, the Ottoman country could never become a nation or a homogeneous social entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. When the political structure began to be questioned, various groups asserted their distinct identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The Greek independence was a major turning point, as it showed that a separate political formation based on identity was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### The Ottoman Elite's Mindset and Policies

The [[role_of_educated_classes_in_turkey | Ottoman elite]] was deeply ingrained in a system that led to the country's collapse. The empire's management model was based on exploiting surplus value from society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. While initially successful in generating wealth for grand projects (mosques, palaces), it eventually led to the exploitation of the "marrow of society" and widespread hunger among peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. The skill, it is argued, is to collect surplus value "neither too little nor too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. The Ottoman Empire achieved an unprecedented level of surplus value exploitation, leading to its collapse, similar to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

#### Conservative Stance and Isolation

The [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_turkey | Ottoman elite]] developed a conservative and introverted mindset. Conservatism in this context is defined as an inability to find a way out of prevailing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This conservatism, rooted in economic blockage starting from the late 16th century (last years of Kanuni, Selim III, Murat, Ahmet), led to ruthless and bloody internal conflicts as the "pie to be shared" shrunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. The Janissaries rebelled, and a brutal central dictatorship was established, where even slight failures could lead to mass executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

With the end of the conquest and plunder process, the economic foundations weakened, and the regime began to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. During Mehmet IV's reign and reaching its peak in the Tulip Period, a new feeling emerged: "Enough, we are a poor but beautiful nation... let's live with the memories and symbols of that culture, what is the need anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. The elite aimed to maintain a certain quality of life within their circle, believing it was better than destroying and rebuilding everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

This led to a deepening [[cultural_and_social_dynamics_in_the_late_ottoman_period | cultural gap between the elite and the masses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. The elite feared political experimentation because the majority of the empire's population was non-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Shaking the conquest-based authority, which positioned the Muslim minority as sole rulers, could lead to terrible consequences, including the physical destruction of the Muslim minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

#### Opposition to Modernization

The Ottoman elite's reluctance to adopt innovations like the printing press stemmed from a fundamental policy: the purpose was not for everyone to read or learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. They believed that reading would make people question the system and refuse to be exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. By the 1700s, the elite had become impoverished but still maintained a "refined life in a certain circle in Istanbul" and saw no reason to share their "Ivory Tower" with the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. They believed that establishing a printing house would threaten their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

The [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_turkey | Ottoman elite culture]] became extremely Baroque, very foreign to modern sensibilities, and intensely self-referential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. An example is Şeyhülislam Esad Efendi's dictionary, *Lehçetü'l Lügat* (1732), whose preface is almost incomprehensible without a dictionary, demonstrating an incredibly sophisticated yet incredibly narrow culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. It was written for a very small circle of initiates, a "cultural acrobatics" designed to be understood by only a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | Ottoman reform]] efforts were a desperate attempt to change a system that could no longer continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. The established structure was so fragile that pulling out even two bricks could cause its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. Indeed, it did collapse in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

The last 500 years of [[ottoman_empire_historical_assessment | modern Turkish history]] are summarized by this trajectory: from being one of the richest, most productive, and cultured countries in the world, Turkey devolved into a state of "misery and a garbage dump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. The question of "why did this happen" remains central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

### Recommended Readings
To understand the mentality of the Ottoman elite, particularly from the 18th and 19th centuries:
*   **Foreign travel books from the 18th century:** These provide detailed observations and testimonies of the Ottoman lands, offering insights from an outsider's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Ottoman history books:** Specifically, works like the comprehensive history by Instrument Master or Heart Master and the Universe Master, and the continuation by Cevdet Pasha, are useful for understanding the period's mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Ibn'ul Emin Mahmud Kemal İnal's *Last Grand Viziers*:** Reading this can be stimulating for understanding the period and its mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

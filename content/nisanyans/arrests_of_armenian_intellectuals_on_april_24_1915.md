April 24th is observed worldwide, particularly in Armenia, as the day of [[armenian_genocide_commemoration_and_april_24th | commemoration of the Armenian genocide of 1915]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. In Armenia, it is a profoundly emotional event, with the entire population of the city walking to the monument on a hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It's important to note that April 24th itself is not the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] but a political step taken just before it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This specific political action helps understand the subsequent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## The Operation and Arrests
On the night of April 24, 1915, in [[armenian_presence_and_cultural_figures_in_istanbul_during_early_1900s | Istanbul]], Erzurum, and other major cities, an operation was carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Between 235 and 250 prominent figures of the Armenian community within the Ottoman Empire were arrested in [[armenian_presence_and_cultural_figures_in_istanbul_during_early_1900s | Istanbul]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

Those arrested included:
*   Writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>
*   Leaders of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>
*   Politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>
*   Members of parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>
*   Doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Clergymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Poets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Painters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Other known intellectuals who had an impact in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>

These individuals were gathered from their homes, streets, and restaurants in a large-scale operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. A few days later, a group of them was sent to two places in Anatolia: Ayaş and Çankırı <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. While some managed to escape, others were never heard from again and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Similar operations occurred in other cities like Erzurum, Kayseri, and Yozgat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. In Sivas, prominent individuals were reportedly called to the governor's office, killed in a room, and their bodies thrown into a waiting car outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Nature and Intent of the Arrests
This operation was a political collapse aimed at "cleansing" society's political leaders and those who could raise their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The state collected information and then swiftly rounded up individuals, regardless of their guilt or innocence in political matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Among those arrested were individuals strongly opposed to extremist nationalist Armenian movements, as well as those with no connection to any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The approach was to gather all prominent figures and leaders of the society, indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Precursor to Wider Events
These arrests were a precursor to the larger events that began in May, involving the deportation of civilians, women, and children across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This gradually escalated into a mass murder and massacre process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is seen as the most significant social and political event of the 20th century in Türkiye, profoundly altering the country's societal color and composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. It forms the psychological and economic basis of its political transformation and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. The deliberate elimination of the Armenian population, along with Greek and Assyrian populations, represents Türkiye's greatest trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>. This project of cleansing Anatolia from non-Muslim populations was systematically prepared and implemented, culminating in the 1915 events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that denying the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is either ignorance or immorality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. The fact of the [[armenian_genocide | genocide]] is obvious and known by everyone in the world, except for the Turkish state, which for various reasons, has designed and implemented this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

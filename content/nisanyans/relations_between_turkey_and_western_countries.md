## Historical Western Influence on Ottoman/Turkish Modernization

During the Tanzimat Period, the educated classes of the Ottoman Empire, particularly those aware of the wider world, unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West, especially France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. While not intending to abandon the "noble morality of Islam," they recognized Westerners as more honest, less prone to bribery, better educated, and more respectful of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. Western cities were perceived as cleaner, their educational institutions magnificent, and their science advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.

Western morality was seen as rooted in humane values, trustworthiness, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This perspective is a basic assumption throughout 19th-century Turkish literature, where Europeans are consistently portrayed as representatives of a superior civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Women's rights emerged as a crucial aspect of this modernization. Ottoman intellectuals believed that a nation with ignorant women would remain backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Educating girls, from the 1840s to the 1850s, was considered the most vital dimension of civilization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

In 1880, the Ottoman Empire opened a Girls' Teachers' School (Darül muallimat), the same year as the first state girls' high school in France, marking a significant step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. This school adopted a completely Western-style curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. By 1920, before the Republic, women's magazines frequently advocated for women's education as a path to a modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

## British Influence on Early Turkish Republic Formation

There is a historical understanding that Mustafa Kemal had a close relationship with British services, particularly in the early stages of his career, around 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>. The rapid loss of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria within 40 days of World War I in 1918 is described as a "staged fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. The British attacked with minimal forces and captured three Ottoman armies, then halted their advance at Kilis, where Arab villages ended and Turkish villages began, accepting a ceasefire the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. This sequence of events is seen as the result of a secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

A "reasonable scenario" of this agreement suggests that Mustafa Kemal Pasha was in Vienna and Karlsbad for health reasons in May and June 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a>. Coincidentally, the brother of the King of England was also in Vienna, reportedly attempting to negotiate a separate peace with Germany and find common ground with the English and French through back-channel diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>. On the last day of June, the Sultan died, and Mustafa Kemal immediately returned to Istanbul, was received by the new Sultan Vahdettin, and soon after was appointed Commander of the Palestine front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. His first action in Palestine was to dismiss German Chiefs of Staff and effectively disable the army group commander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>. This led to the immediate defeat of the British attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>.

Upon returning to Istanbul, Mustafa Kemal maintained close and frequent contact with the director of British intelligence in the Ottoman Empire in 1918-1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>, only ceasing contact when he departed for Samsun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>.

The British policy at the time sought to eliminate Enver Pasha and his team, exclude the French from the region, and prevent Russian influence from extending to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>. Mustafa Kemal Pasha fit perfectly within this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. The British had no intention of occupying Turkey but desired the establishment of a modern Turkish state that would maintain good relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>. This included modernizing laws and building infrastructure like railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. This support for Mustafa Kemal was primarily to counter Russian, Enver's, and French influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>.

Germany's current foreign policy shows a strong alignment with the United States, described as "licking the appropriate places of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. The German Foreign Minister is seen as engaging in a "stupidity competition" with the American Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. This stance has led to the collapse of German industry within two years due to US-imposed sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.

The Nord Stream pipeline, Germany's most crucial energy link with Russia, was destroyed, an act for which Germany officially claims ignorance of the perpetrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. This perceived helplessness by a major state with significant intelligence agencies suggests a deeper, unexplained dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

The United States has pursued a serious policy regarding Germany since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. Following German reunification in 1990, Germany re-emerged as a powerful state, altering the post-WWII world balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. Since 1945, one half of Germany was under US military control, and the other under Soviet control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. The unification created a new, complex reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

German leaders, including Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder, and Angela Merkel, understood that Germany's future hinged on a close alliance with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. Russia possesses vast natural resources and a large consumer market, while Germany has a strong industrial base and a skilled workforce; these two economies complement each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. Merkel, particularly, pursued policies that fostered mutual dependence between Germany and Russia, with the Nord Stream pipeline being a key project to intertwine their energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

America, viewing this as a matter of "life-or-death" for its own existence, actively sought to disrupt German-Russian relations through increasingly harsh operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. The Navalny poisoning was cited as one such operation, ultimately culminating in the provocation of the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. The Ukraine War forced Germany to take a definitive stance, with its leaders facing immense pressure to align with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. While long-standing advocates for rapprochement with Russia (Ostpolitik) still exist in Germany, they are currently subdued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

This geopolitical dynamic is not unprecedented; historical examples like Germany's unexpected attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, despite being allies, and Austria's betrayal of Napoleon in 1813 after years of close friendship, illustrate how powerful states can suddenly shift alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.# [[turkeys_relations_with_western_countries_post1974 | Relations between Turkey and Western Countries]]

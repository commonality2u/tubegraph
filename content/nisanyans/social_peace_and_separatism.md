## The Illusion of Confronting the Past
The concept of societies confronting their past wounds is dismissed as "shaving words" and unnecessary for achieving social peace [00:03:52]. Instead, it is argued that societies do not confront their past [00:03:58]. Those in power impose their own point of view, past, and values on the public, while those without power merely "nag and complain" [00:04:16 - 00:04:24].

## Separatist Movements and the Nation-State
When considering major conflicts, especially those involving [[social_and_political_issues_in_england | separatist]] tendencies, it's suggested that both sides often hold valid perspectives [00:04:44 - 00:05:02]. Applying the wisdom of Nasreddin Hodja, the speaker concludes that there is no other solution than to acknowledge that "you are right, you are right" for all parties involved in such disputes [00:05:19 - 00:05:26].

### The United Kingdom
The United Kingdom has been in a continuous decline since losing its empire in 1918, experiencing a gradual and irreversible disintegration of its institutions, national culture, economic prosperity, military power, and international credibility [00:05:28 - 00:06:13]. While serious [[social_and_political_issues_in_england | separatism]] in Wales is questioned, it is definitely present in Scotland and Ireland [00:06:29 - 00:06:31]. The unification of Northern and Southern Ireland, leading to independence from British rule, appears imminent [00:06:35 - 00:06:45].

The question arises regarding the extent and legitimacy of national communities demanding independence [00:06:53 - 00:07:07]. This leads to further considerations:
*   Should the Scots be independent? [00:07:11]
*   Should regions within Scotland, like the Highlands, separate? [00:07:18 - 00:07:26]
*   Should cities gain independence? [00:07:31 - 00:07:34]
*   Should Catalonia or Galicia in Spain be independent? [00:07:34 - 00:07:45]

### The Absurdity of the Nation-State
The current state of affairs, with various demands for self-determination, signifies that the concept of the "Nation-State" and the mentality that briefly dominated history have reached a point of "logical absurdity" in political theory [00:08:20 - 00:08:38]. When the "right of determination" for nations is taken seriously, it leads to an endless chain of fragmentation, exemplified by regions within countries seeking independence (e.g., Georgians, Abkhazians, Montenegrins) [00:08:47 - 00:09:13].

Montenegro serves as a case study:
*   Its language, known as "zero watcha" (Serbian and Croatian), is now considered two separate languages [00:09:18 - 00:09:26].
*   There is a significant debate within Montenegro as to whether Montenegrin is a separate language from Serbian [00:10:05 - 00:10:19].
*   Culturally and ideologically, Montenegro has been a branch of the Serbian church [00:10:31 - 00:10:38].
*   Upon gaining independence, the state declared its church must also be independent from the Serbian church, leading to street violence [00:10:42 - 00:11:00].
*   The speaker questions how far this process of separation can go, implying it has no logical end [00:11:22 - 00:11:32].

### Lessons from the Soviet Union's Collapse
Mikhail Gorbachev is viewed by many in former Soviet countries as a traitor who destroyed the country [01:11:58 - 01:12:12]. Conversely, in the Western world, he is described as a hero of freedom [01:12:25 - 01:12:29]. The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle [01:13:05].

The Soviet system was exhausted economically, ideologically, and institutionally, nearing collapse [01:13:12 - 01:13:29]. The Soviet project aimed to give humanity a new direction by preventing individual greed and wealth accumulation, which necessitated a "maniac police state" [01:13:46 - 01:14:35]. This police state eventually became an end in itself, characterized by oppression and tyranny [01:14:38 - 01:14:45].

A national mobilization atmosphere, where individual interests are set aside for collective development, can be successful for a period (e.g., 10-20 years) [01:14:56 - 01:15:28]. However, this collectivism eventually turns into bureaucracy, which cannot maintain the initial excitement and dynamism [01:15:56 - 01:16:10]. The bureaucracy then succumbs to its own corruption and "dull intelligence" [01:16:13 - 01:16:26]. The Soviet Union became such a police state and bureaucratic swamp [01:16:29 - 01:16:31].

Gorbachev's crucial historical step was withdrawing military presence from Eastern Europe in 1989 [01:23:36 - 01:23:39], effectively gifting East Germany and three Eastern European countries (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to Germany [01:24:27 - 01:25:06]. This act was expected to lead to Russia's integration into Europe, forming a "great Europe" from Hamburg to the Pacific Ocean, with a German-Russian alliance reshaping the world [01:27:39 - 01:28:09]. This integration would have provided Germany with a vast market and access to Russia's abundant natural resources, reversing Europe's century-long decline [01:28:27 - 01:29:38].

The United States, to prevent this German-Russian fusion and the end of its world domination, restructured NATO as an offensive alliance against Russia starting in 1997-1998 [01:30:13 - 01:30:27]. This decision was aimed at preserving America's global influence and its control over the system established through Middle Eastern oil [01:30:34]. Despite this, Germany continued to develop a mutual dependency with Russia, particularly in energy through the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline [01:31:48 - 01:32:34]. The Ukrainian War led to Germany shelving this pipeline, but the speaker believes it will likely be on the agenda again [01:33:14 - 01:33:50].

### Historical Context of Separatist Movements in Türkiye
The situation of Laz and Circassians in Türkiye is notably different from that of Kurds [01:14:11].

*   **Circassians:** Fought against Russia for nearly 20 years, spurred by the Ottomans, and were then violently suppressed and deported [01:14:15 - 01:14:39]. They found refuge in the Ottoman Empire and felt a strong "debt of nation" to the Turkish state that saved them [01:14:56 - 01:15:11]. During the collapse of the Ottoman regime, some Circassians rebelled against the Ankara regime in favor of the Istanbul regime, while others cooperated with Ankara [01:15:24 - 01:16:11]. Since around 1927-1928, they have made peace with the Republic of Turkey and become one of its "strongest, most solid and most loyal pillars" [01:16:24 - 01:16:35].
*   **Laz People:** Have a history of [[rebellions_and_social_integration_of_alevism | rebellious]] life, showing a dismissive attitude towards state authority and outside interference [01:16:35 - 01:16:46]. Their culture even considered piracy and banditry acceptable professions [01:17:02]. A significant rebellion under Tuzcuoğlu Memiş Ağa against the Ottoman State occurred in 1828, lasting nearly 15 years until 1841-1842 [01:17:09 - 01:17:21]. This rebellion was violently suppressed, leading to the subjugation of the Laz people, who have since preferred to remain calm [01:17:28 - 01:18:11].

## Assimilation and National Identity
The phenomenon of Muslim Albanians and Bosnians existing, but not Muslim Greek Vermians, while some Greeks became Turks, is explained by geographical proximity to the center of power [01:18:11 - 01:18:17]. Bosnia and Albania are far from the center and in mountainous areas [01:18:21 - 01:18:28].

*   Greeks and Armenians who were far away from central authority underwent a similar process [01:18:33 - 01:18:41].
*   The Armenians of Hemşin became Muslims but retained their Armenian identity for a long time [01:18:42 - 01:18:49].
*   Some Greeks in the mountainous regions of northern Greece and southwestern Macedonia became Muslims and identified as "patriots" in Türkiye, known by the derogatory term "God Hades" in Greece [01:19:01 - 01:19:16].
*   Peripheral nations tend to experience partial and corrupt assimilation, or "semi-assimilation" [01:19:18 - 01:19:35].
*   Closer to the center, the choice was clearer: either retain one's Armenian or Greek identity (benefiting from specific administrative privileges) or become Muslim and fully Turkish [01:19:35 - 01:19:55]. Millions of people of Armenian origin in Türkiye are today called Turks or Kurds, and reminding them of their past is considered a crime [01:19:56 - 01:20:16].

## The State as a Mafia Organization
The state is characterized as the "biggest mafia organization" [01:48:06 - 01:48:10]. Its function is akin to that of other mafia organizations: collecting tribute in exchange for protection and services, particularly against bandits, looters, and smaller mafias [01:48:15 - 01:48:39]. Societies need this, as breaking up one mafia organization only leads to the emergence of others [01:48:47 - 01:48:51].

## Gender Inequality and [[power_dynamics_and_social_organization | Social Organization]]
The idea that male-female inequality is based on men's muscle power is dismissed as only true in "primitive societies" or "degenerate layers" [00:59:48 - 01:00:05]. The underlying reason for women's historical secondary status in some issues is fertility [01:00:17 - 01:00:21]. Women give birth and require protection and support for years after, as they are primarily responsible for childcare and breastfeeding [01:00:25 - 01:01:08]. This creates a dependency on someone to meet basic needs [01:01:08 - 01:01:23].

This dynamic does not imply that women accept obedience or an inferior status in every field, but rather in certain social, economic, and administrative roles [01:01:39 - 01:01:53]. While the man often earns the bread and protects the home, the woman typically dominates within the household [01:02:00 - 01:02:24]. This historical division of labor, where one side gives birth and cares for the child, and the other side works to secure the home, has led to an evolutionary tendency in "helmet strength" [01:02:37 - 01:03:18].

## ODTÜ Protest
In February 2013, the speaker was invited to ODTÜ (Middle East Technical University) for a symposium on Islamic history and to debate Edip Yüksel on the existence of God [01:24:26 - 01:24:41]. This debate was seen as a groundbreaking event in Türkiye [01:25:32 - 01:25:46].

During the event, a group claiming to be feminists used a five-year-old incident as an excuse to protest and prevent the debate [01:26:01 - 01:26:20]. They shouted slogans and occupied the stage [01:26:36 - 01:26:41]. The speaker stood on stage with them, joked, and talked, causing the protesters to withdraw as they had expected an aggressive response [01:26:50 - 01:27:04]. Later, during the afternoon session, the protesters again created chaos, occupying the stage and chanting [01:28:01 - 01:28:09]. When challenged about being prevented from entering ODTÜ, the speaker responded defiantly, leading to a dozen pre-positioned young women leaving the hall in protest [01:28:15 - 01:29:03]. Edip Yüksel then hesitated and gave up on the debate, though the speaker believed resistance was a moral duty [01:29:03 - 01:29:13]. The incident was seen as an obvious political move by someone using feminists to prevent the debate, with security forces potentially instructed by the government [01:27:25 - 01:27:55].

## Political Landscape of Türkiye
In the context of potential government intervention in the 2023 elections and the use of state law enforcement, the speaker doubts the opposition's capacity for violence [01:29:31 - 01:30:03]. Election manipulation can occur through sophisticated, not crude, methods [01:30:10 - 01:30:30]. The speaker insists the current government will not leave, as it has no intention to, and there is no power to overthrow it [01:30:41 - 01:30:48]. Bureaucracy, the Supreme Electoral Council, the Constitutional Court, and street demonstrations are considered ineffective [01:30:52 - 01:30:57]. The only power capable of overthrowing the government is the MHP (Nationalist Movement Party), specifically if Devlet Bahçeli decides to do so [01:31:13 - 01:31:23].

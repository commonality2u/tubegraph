The story of the Seven Sleepers, as presented in the Quran, can be analyzed from a broader framework beyond traditional Islamic perspectives to understand its origins more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This approach aims to provide a more powerful and convincing understanding of the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Quranic Narrative

The Quranic account of the Seven Sleepers is found in Surah Kahf (Chapter 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It describes seven young believers who, on an unknown date and in an unknown place, were oppressed and sought refuge in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. They slept for hundreds of years before waking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. One of them went to the market with an old coin, surprising people and revealing their long slumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. In Islamic belief, this story is often seen as an allegory for the Apocalypse or resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The Quranic text itself presents ambiguities regarding the details:
*   The exact number of sleepers is left vague, stating, "Some say 3 people. Some say 5 people, some say 7 people. None of them know anything. Don't ask them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This creates an impression that the author of the Quran or Allah does not have sufficient knowledge on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, the duration of their sleep is ambiguous: "They stayed in the cave for 300 years but there are also those who say 309 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### The Enigma of "Rakim"

A significant point of ambiguity in Surah Kahf (verse 9) is the word "Rakim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While "Kahf" clearly means "cave," "Rakim" is described as a "completely esr word" with "no such word" in Arabic dictionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Traditional commentators, such as Ibn Abbas (considered the father of commentators), offered various interpretations for "Rakim":
*   The name of a valley next to Eile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   The name of a city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   The name of the mountain where the cave is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   The name of their building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   The name of the cave itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   The name of the tablets on which the men's story was written, placed at the cave entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Turkish translations also reflect this ambiguity:
*   Elmalılı Tafsir interprets "Rakim" as the "stone inscription on which the names of the Companions of the Cave and the Rakim were written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   The old interpretation of the Directorate of Religious Affairs translates "Rakim" as "Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   Other interpretations range from "monuments erected on them" to simply "written" or "inscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

These varied interpretations highlight the word's "completely ambiguous" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Historical and Literary Precedents

The story of the Seven Sleepers exists in pre-Quranic sources, primarily in Syriac Christian traditions. The oldest known version is told by Jacob of Serugh (Saru Jacob), a Monophysite church founder who lived from 451 to 521 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This story, known as "Decius and the story of the seven sleepers," emphasizes that it took place in Ephesus during the reign of Emperor Decius (around 250 AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. During a period of harsh oppression against Christians, young people from Ephesus were locked in a cave and reappeared during the reign of Emperor Theodosius about 100 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This narrative was widely told throughout Byzantium, especially among the Syriacs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

In Western languages, the story first appeared in Latin in the *History of Saints* by Gregory of Tours (6th century AD), who stated he heard it from a Syrian source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Importantly, in these versions, the dog Kıtmir, mentioned in Islamic sources, is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. While most versions cite seven sleepers, some old manuscripts mention eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

## Linguistic Analysis: Rakim and Decius

A key hypothesis links the Quranic "Rakim" to the Syriac name "Decius" (or "Dekus" in Syriac script). If written poorly in Syriac script, the letters for "Dekus" (D-K-Y-S) can easily be misread as "Rakim" (R-K-Y-M) due to the visual similarity of the Syriac 'D' and 'R' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. In older Syriac scripts (Estrangelo, Jewish Syriac), dots used in modern Syriac to distinguish these letters were absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This phonetic and visual similarity suggests that "Rakim" might be a corrupted transcription of "Decius," the emperor associated with the story's historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

This implies that the Quranic text, instead of being a revelation without prior knowledge, could be a report of a story that was heard and recorded, potentially with a scribal or auditory error in transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Such errors are more likely when quoting from a written source, especially if transferring from one alphabet to another, such as Aramaic letters to Arabic letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Implications for Quranic Interpretation and Historical Context

The proposed linguistic link between "Rakim" and "Decius" introduces a significant challenge to traditional interpretations. It suggests that the Quran might be incorporating existing narratives, and that some of its ambiguities stem from human transmission rather than divine mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### The Need for Non-Islamic Perspectives
Understanding these complexities requires going "beyond the framework of the Islamic perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Traditional Islamic scholarship, while demonstrating "extremely rational effort" within its paradigm, may be constrained by a "chain of assumptions" that prevents it from reaching alternative explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Engaging with external historical, linguistic, and literary sources, such as the works of Syriac religious scholars or Christian saints like Jacob of Serugh, can clarify incidents immediately, negating the need for extensive internal debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### Literacy and Script in Arabia
In the time of Muhammad, a significant level of literacy, especially in Aramaic script (the standard script of the East), existed in the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Both Jews and Christians used Aramaic for their sacred affairs and had literate members in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Muhammad's close circle included individuals who knew this script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. For example, two Iraqi slaves in Mecca, and Hatice's cousin, were known to have learned Christian script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Mecca, as a cosmopolitan city on trade routes, had frequent interactions with people from culturally developed regions like Damascus, Hire, India, and Abyssinia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Many Meccans traveled abroad, including to Abyssinia (a Christian country with a written culture), and brought back "ideas, some experiences, some fashions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. This environment means there were "definitely enough people around Muhammad who are more or less knowledgeable about Aramaic script" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

In contrast, Arabic was not yet a widely written language during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. This situation is comparable to 10th-century France, where people spoke French, but written examples were rare before the 12th century, with Latin serving as the primary written language for official and religious purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This context further supports the possibility of oral transmission and potential mishearings or mis-transcriptions of foreign-language narratives into early Arabic.

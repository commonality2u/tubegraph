The Treaty of Sevres, signed in 1920, was a significant document in the post-World War I era, particularly impacting [[Greek Turkish Relations and Aegean Sea Disputes | Greek-Turkish relations]]. However, it was described as a "very strange text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> and a "stillborn treaty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, as no one ultimately signed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It functioned primarily as a bargaining and threatening document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Initial Greek Presence in Anatolia

Before the formalization of the Treaty of Sevres, Greece was permitted to land troops in Izmir (Smyrna) and Ayvalık in May 1919. This decision, made at the Paris Peace Conference, aimed to "maintain public order in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> and provide a safe haven for Greek refugees who had been deported by Turks from the Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This operation was initially characterized as a "police operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, with Greece not raising its own flags in these cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The area promised to Greece on the international platform was limited to the province of Izmir and the district of Ayvalık <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It was not initially on the agenda for Greece to permanently settle and claim these territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Despite this, "the Greeks had great hopes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> for greater territorial gains.

## Provisions of the Treaty of Sevres

The Treaty of Sevres included provisions for a five-year occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, after which a referendum would be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The clear implication was that these areas would be ceded to Greece after this transitional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Greek Military Operations Beyond Treaty Terms

Distinct from the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres, Greece undertook significant military operations in Anatolia. In 1920 and 1921, the Greek Army expanded beyond the borders of Izmir province, invading areas like Nazilli, Bursa, and Aydın <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In a second wave, Greek forces reached the Sakarya River, aiming to capture Ankara, but were ultimately stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

These expansive operations, encompassing much of Western Anatolia, were not intended for direct annexation by Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Instead, their primary objective was to compel the Turkish national movement in Ankara to surrender or at least negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This was a "punitive operation aimed at making the Ankara government accept the Treaty of Sevres or the amended and renegotiated versions of the Treaty of Sevres or to eliminate the Ankara government and directly deal with Istanbul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Hypothetical Outcomes of Greek Success

Had the Greek military operations been successful in capturing Ankara, the outcome would have been a reformulation of the Treaty of Sevres to reflect the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This would likely have resulted in Greece acquiring Izmir and the Aegean coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Additionally, a "consortium management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> would have been established in Istanbul, with Greek involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Such a Greek victory would have had far-reaching consequences:
*   **Diplomatic Shift** The British would have become the sole diplomatic power in the region, leading to "endless and bottomless conflict between France and England" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, with Italy aligning with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Turkish Resistance** Despite military defeat, the Turkish population, with its large majority and developed administrative class (officers, civil servants, intellectuals), would not have remained passive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. They would have continued their struggle through economic, social, political, and propaganda means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Long-term Instability** A Turkey managed under British rule, using Greece as a tool, would eventually join the "avengers camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This [[turkish_historical_events | Turkey]] would have likely sided with Germany in a future war, potentially altering the course of the World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Military Realities

At the time, the Greek army and the re-established Turkish army (TBMM army) were roughly comparable in terms of soldier numbers, around 190,000-200,000 mutually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. However, Turkey's population was 4 to 5 times larger than Greece's, and its economy was at least 3 times greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This fundamental [[comparison_of_greek_and_turkish_military_and_economic_strength | disparity]] meant that while a short war might depend on luck, a prolonged conflict would inevitably favor Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Experts, including the British and French, acknowledged that Greece had no chance of winning a war against Turkey that lasted longer than one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The only scenario for Greek success was a swift, decisive blow with strong initial support from England, disbanding the unorganized Ankara government's army before it could establish a defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Once the conflict became a prolonged frontal war, especially after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece's chances disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

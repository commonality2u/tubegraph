From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Ethnic cleansing is described as the act of occupying someone's land, seizing their house, throwing them out, and then bringing someone else to settle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. It is considered a terrible act, with the worst aspect being the uprooting of people and societies from their places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This process makes people homeless and leaves wounds in their souls that can last for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>.

## Historical Context

Ethnic cleansing has unfortunately been a constant throughout human history, as people have struggled to share limited lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>. History is full of examples where one group defeats another and drives them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>. The speaker asserts that such actions deny people their past and rights, which are "terrible things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:52">[02:39:52]</a>.

## Examples and Critiques

### Turkish Historical Narrative

The speaker criticizes the contradiction in the Republic of Turkey's stance on ethnic cleansing. While the current Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, states that ethnic cleansing is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:04">[02:00:04]</a>, the Turkish state has built its entire historical narrative and discourse on glorifying ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. This glorification is seen in historical events commonly cited, such as 1071 (Battle of Manzikert), 1453 (Conquest of Constantinople), and 1915 (referencing the [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The speaker argues that if a state glorifies such acts from 100 years ago, it cannot object to others doing the same without hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

The establishment of Israel is described as a "historical disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:31">[02:43:31]</a>. Europeans, using the persecution of Jews as an excuse, effectively ignored the rights of the settled, dense population that had been living in Palestine for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:55">[02:49:55]</a>.

Palestinians were expelled from their lands in 1948 and again in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. They were expelled by force of arms, their lands confiscated, and they were not allowed to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>. Many went to refugee camps and assembly centers, living in terrible conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>. After 1967, Israel occupied these areas and established a system of cruelty and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

The speaker notes a change in perspective on Israel over 20 years, stating that Israel has "completely lost its moral superiority" observed in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:02">[03:01:02]</a>. This is attributed to the rise of increasingly fanatic cadres with ideologies reminiscent of 1930s Germany, adopting a "we are strong, we can do whatever we want" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The current Israeli policy in Gaza, involving bombings and massacres, is seen as part of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:48">[03:08:48]</a>.

### The Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem

A historical parallel is drawn between modern Israel and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:39">[04:42:39]</a>. This state, approximately the size of modern Israel, was established by Western knights and military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. It existed for 84 years, developing a unique culture, but was ultimately defeated and destroyed by Saladin Ayyubi's armies around 1186 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:07">[04:40:07]</a>. Those who survived either got on ships and left or settled and became Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:14">[04:41:14]</a>. The speaker sees this historical repetition as a "very strong possibility today" for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:36">[04:43:36]</a>.

### The [[historical_perspectives_on_the_bosnian_war | Bosnian War]]

Alija Izetbegović, a figure in the [[historical_perspectives_on_the_bosnian_war | Bosnian War]], is depicted as someone who, despite intellectual value, "destroyed his country with good intentions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:24">[04:26:24]</a>. With Muslims forming 44% of the population in Bosnia, Serbs and Croats were unwilling to submit to Muslim sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:39">[04:43:39]</a>. Izetbegović's "foolish idealism" in aiming for an impossible Bosnian state, and his subsequent rejection of a peace plan after American intervention, led to the bloodiest civil war in Europe in 60 years (before the Ukraine war) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:02">[04:44:02]</a>.

## Potential Solutions

The speaker believes that a permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is only possible with the "elimination of one of the two sides" as a political entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:01">[04:58:01]</a>. A "two-state solution," often advocated by Russia and China, is deemed neither rational nor honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:07">[04:10:07]</a>. This proposed solution would condemn Palestinians to live in a very narrow, economically unworkable, isolated area, completely dependent on Israel—likened to a "concentration camp system" or "Bantustan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>. Therefore, the speaker suggests two main possibilities:
1.  Palestinians are defeated and ethnically cleansed (Gaza flattened, West Bank weakened) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:39">[04:41:39]</a>.
2.  Israel is defeated and ceases to exist as a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:13">[04:42:13]</a>.

The speaker expresses hope that such elimination would not involve the massacre of populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:10">[04:55:10]</a>.

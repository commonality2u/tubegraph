## Context of the Islamic World
Leading up to the Crusades, the [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islamic world]] experienced a period of stagnation and regression, losing its aggressiveness despite previously expanding its borders from the beginning of the 10th century to the end of the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. While some small trade relations were established with Europe, the [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islamic world]] struggled to maintain a civilized order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

A new storm arose around the 1070s when the Turks began to establish a new [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islamic Empire]] in the region, initiating a significant [[role_of_islam_in_historical_political_systems | Islamic spread]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This expansion caused considerable fear and reaction in Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Triggers for the Crusades
The primary catalyst for the Crusades was the fall of significant religious sites, such as Jerusalem and Palestine (homeland of the stories in the [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Torah and the Bible]]), into Turkish hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Reports of European pilgrims facing poor treatment further fueled the reaction and anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. These difficulties acted as the spark that ignited the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## Underlying European Developments
Beyond immediate triggers, a long-term secular development underpinned the Crusades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Europe, previously considered a primitive continent, began to grow wealthy and urbanize in the 11th century, leading to a significant increase in population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

This economic and demographic growth led to an increased number of military members seeking opportunities to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Specifically, the aristocratic class experienced population growth, resulting in a young generation of nobles who could not find sufficient economic and social opportunities in their homelands and sought new horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This emerging group was a primary driver for the Crusades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

## The Power Vacuum and Complementary Movements
The Crusades also arose from a power vacuum in the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. The [[rise_and_fall_of_empires_and_national_identity | Arab Empire]] had collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, and the [[rise_and_fall_of_empires_and_national_identity | Byzantine Empire]], attempting to regain control, proved inadequate in its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

This created an opportunity for two "young and raw power centers" on the outer fronts of both powers: the Turks on one side and Western Europe on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. The Turkish conquests and the Crusades are thus seen as two complementary processes, mirror images of each other, and are both cause and result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Both movements were fed by similar demographic and economic developments of the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

## Debunking Myths
The notion of "Templar Knights' treasures" is considered a fairy tale told to the ignorant and children to make the historical narrative more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. The real story, when delved into, is often more interesting than embellished versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Understanding the genuine struggles, concerns, choices, and conflicts of real people throughout history is described as the most intellectually satisfying adventure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

## The Exhaustion and Collapse of the Soviet System

The Soviet system was an exhausted one in every respect: economically, ideologically, in terms of self-belief and belief in the future, its institutional structure, and living standards. Everything was on the verge of exhaustion and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12">[13:12]</a>.

### Two Core Structural Flaws
The Soviet Union faced fundamental issues that led to its decline:
1.  **The Police State:** A core aim of the Soviet project was to prevent individual greed for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13">[14:13]</a>. To achieve this, it required establishing a "maniac police state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24">[14:24]</a>. After a certain point, this police state became its own purpose, with oppression and tyranny as its sole reason for existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35">[14:35]</a>.
2.  **Unsustainable Mobilization:** A national mobilization atmosphere, where individual interests are set aside for collective development, can be successful for a period (e.g., 10-20 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56">[14:56]</a>. However, this collective mobilization requires everyone to be part of a common cause, preventing individual economic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38">[15:38]</a>. This system eventually turns into a bureaucratic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56">[15:56]</a>. The bureaucracy cannot maintain the initial excitement and dynamism, eventually falling prey to its own corruption and dull intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10">[16:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the Soviet Union became a "Police state and a bureaucratic swamp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29">[16:29]</a>. While some might argue for its sustainability, likening it to North Korea's imposition of military control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07">[17:07]</a>, the speaker asserts that "it was not possible, you could not be made to swim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04">[17:04]</a>.

## Gorbachev's Legacy and its Impact

Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms domestically are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19">[23:19]</a>. His most significant historical step was the withdrawal of [[role_and_collapse_of_communist_parties_in_europe | Soviet military presence]] from Eastern Europe in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36">[23:36]</a>. This act completely transformed history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41">[23:41]</a>.

### Perceptions of Gorbachev
Gorbachev is viewed in starkly contrasting ways:
*   In post-Soviet countries like Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine, he is widely regarded as a traitor, an enemy of humanity, an agent who destroyed the country, and dishonorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>.
*   In the Western world, he is described as a freedom hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25">[12:25]</a>.
The truth is likely somewhere in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05">[13:05]</a>.

### The "Gift" to Germany
Gorbachev "literally gifted half of Germany to West Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19">[24:19]</a> by handing over East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35">[24:35]</a>. He also gifted Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, which were natural expansion areas and hinterlands for German industry and trade, to Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50">[24:50]</a>. Germany subsequently economically dominated these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15">[25:15]</a>.

This act, done without visible bargaining, suggests an expectation of something in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44">[25:44]</a>. The prevailing hope and expectation at the time was that [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Russia]] would be accepted into Europe, becoming part of its civilization, culture, and economy, especially through a special relationship with Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35">[27:35]</a>. This envisioned a "great Europe extending from Hamburg to the Pacific Ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58">[27:58]</a>, with Russia as a founding element, leading to a world reshaped by a German-Russian alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09">[28:09]</a>.

Such an alliance would have been attractive for Germany, providing a huge, untouched market for its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22">[28:22]</a> and access to Russia's abundant natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49">[28:49]</a>. This could have reversed Europe's century-long decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35">[29:35]</a>.

### US Reaction and [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | NATO]]'s Expansion
The United States, starting around 1997-1998, restructured [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | NATO]] into an offensive alliance against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13">[30:13]</a>. This move is understood as a response to the potential fusion of Germany and Russia, which would have meant the end of America's global domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21">[30:21]</a> and the system it established through Middle Eastern oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34">[30:34]</a>. This could have led to Europe challenging America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45">[30:45]</a>. Consequently, Russia was re-declared a historical enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03">[31:03]</a>, and efforts were made to undermine Russia's democratization and public order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16">[31:16]</a>. Most importantly, [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | NATO]] was re-established and strengthened on a platform hostile to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29">[31:29]</a>. This is seen as the real reason for the current war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33">[31:33]</a>.

Despite this, Germany continuously developed a mutual dependency with Russia, investing in Russia, and making itself energy-dependent on Russia, especially through the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45">[31:45]</a>. The US strongly opposed this, threatening Germany in unprecedented ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47">[32:47]</a>. The pipeline was eventually shelved after the outbreak of the [[the_ukraine_war_and_its_impact_on_nato_and_global_alliances | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14">[33:14]</a>.

## Consequences of Collapse for Russia

The post-Soviet era saw rare destruction and social collapse in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44">[18:44]</a>. The standard of living for many people was "reset to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51">[18:51]</a>. Those who trusted the society and state throughout their lives were condemned to misery, begging, prostitution, and gangsterism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09">[19:09]</a>. The country's average life expectancy fell radically, a wave of death covered the country, and the population shrank drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24">[19:24]</a>.

### Recovery under [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Putin's Administration]]
After 10-15 years, Russia's income recovered due to its existing infrastructure, strong education system, cultural foundation, and rich natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44">[19:44]</a>. In the last 20 years, under [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Putin's administration]], Russia has experienced unprecedented development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01">[20:01]</a>. While not returning to the old Soviet period, there are fewer hungry and homeless people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11">[20:11]</a>. Security has been provided, and banditry and mafia activity have been brought under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20">[20:20]</a>. Major cities like [[political_and_social_impressions_of_moscow | Moscow]] now feature clean, prosperous shops and smiling people, indicating a certain middle-class standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35">[20:35]</a>.

### Public Support for [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Putin]]
Given these developments, it is not surprising that the [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Russian]] people greatly admire [[russian_politics_and_putins_regime | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57">[20:57]</a>. He is seen as a successful state manager who has brought peace, tranquility, and development to the country to an extent unmatched by Western political leaders in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10">[21:10]</a>. He is perceived as intelligent, treating society as human beings, speaking logically, and possessing a humorous, modest demeanor that flatters national prejudices and a sense of greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27">[21:27]</a>. The speaker argues that the constant denigration of Putin by Western propaganda is a chain of lies, stating that Russia has not had such a successful leader for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03">[22:03]</a>.

While some might call him a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27">[22:27]</a>, the speaker asserts that Russia is not a worse country than contemporary America in terms of political dictatorship, police state, or legal decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48">[22:48]</a>, implying that "American democracy has long been a joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54">[22:54]</a>.

## Comparison to China's Transformation

A key question posed is why socialism or the Soviet system did not collapse in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23">[17:23]</a>. China successfully changed its system without shedding blood, chaos, or a great abyss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39">[17:39]</a>, transforming into a successful country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48">[17:48]</a>. This challenges the notion that communism was inherently bad and destined to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00">[18:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that while the Soviet Union's economic blockages led to an unsustainable point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10">[19:10]</a>, China managed to "develop its economy and open up a serious area of freedom without going into a regime crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05">[11:05]</a>. This suggests that if the Soviet Union had been able to design itself regarding freedoms and solve its economic issues by opening the economy and allowing "certain chaos" for development, the Soviet regime might have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:18">[1:09:18]</a>.

The Soviet collapse triggered a chain reaction of independence movements, starting with the Baltic countries, then Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59">[10:59]</a>. Had it not been stopped, this process could have extended to regions like Chechnya, Tatarstan, Udmortistan, and Bashkortostan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>.

## Current Situation

The world is currently focused on the conflict in Palestine, particularly a "terrible massacre" and "clearly declared genocide" occurring in [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including_the_ukraine_and_gaza | Gaza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Over 2 million people in Gaza live in a "very crowded, very densely populated concentration camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, cut off from the outside world and unable to move more than 100-200 meters from the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This concentration camp, including its institutions, schools, and hospitals, is being "mercilessly bombed by the State of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The stated purpose of these actions is to force the people to "give up and flee to Egypt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Simultaneously, an "ethnic cleansing movement" was initiated or will be initiated in the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This situation is described as the "most terrible humanitarian disaster of recent years, of recent decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Global Reaction
The incident has aroused "fierce, overwhelming" anger and hatred worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, with the State of Israel believed to be unable to cope with this disaster in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Bloody retaliatory incidents are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Many countries and their populations, including the Islamic world, Africa, Latin America, Russia, and China, have "almost unanimously" greeted this "massacre with hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Public opinion in Western countries has also taken a stance against their own states' policies at an "unprecedented rate in recent history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. In what is described as "panic behavior," countries like England, France, and Germany have banned pro-Palestine demonstrations, threatening arrest, punishment, and deportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Despite these bans, hundreds of thousands of people in these countries are demonstrating, challenging state and police authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Social media worldwide has "overwhelmingly taken a stance in favor of Palestine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>; pro-Palestinian messages on TikTok are calculated to be 15 times more numerous than pro-Israeli messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Western states' support for Israel is questioned, with a suggestion of "incompetence" or "irrationalism" within Western administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The uncompromising support of Western states for Israel since 1917 or 1945 is noted as a "big question mark," with doubts about whether this attitude is "willingly, lovingly and believingly" adopted, or if it is under "some obligations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Arab states and [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Iran]] have responded with an "extremely sloppy attitude," providing "verbal condemnations" but generally following America's orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, this situation is expected to change due to "mass pressure, public pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. It is also believed that [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Iran]] will eventually be compelled to enter the conflict, even if it doesn't want to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

### Nature of the Conflict
While acknowledging that some pro-Palestine views in the Islamic world, particularly [[turkeys_foreign_policy_and_relations_with_israel_and_palestine | Türkiye]], might be based on "primitive, vile and stupid anti-Semitism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, the speaker asserts that the conflict is not limited to that. It is fundamentally an "incident of oppression that the human conscience cannot bear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This oppression has been ongoing since 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, involving:
*   Forcible confiscation of lands from a large population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   Forcible expulsion from their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   Condemnation to life in "concentration camp refugee camps" in "extremely miserable conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   Daily humiliations, bans, and deprivation of basic human and citizen rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

This oppression is felt by "many people in the world, including countless Jews and hundreds of thousands and millions of people in the Western world who have nothing to do with Islam and Allahu Akbar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

Regarding the claims of an "Islamist mob" leading pro-Palestine demonstrations, the speaker contends that while the Palestinian cause is exploited by Islamist groups, it is "not only their cause" but "the cause of all humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Furthermore, the State of Israel, despite its modern appearance, is described as being "as bigoted as the bearded, skullcap-wearing and Islamist group you mentioned, or even more so," having "lost its moral anchor" and being "drunk with oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The choice is presented as between "bad and victimized people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

## Historical Context and Justification
The argument that Israel's occupation is justified by ancient rights or religious texts is rejected as "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Israel's establishment is seen as an act of colonialism and invasion, with England's power used to "collapse on a land that belonged to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Historically, Israel's initial years (first two generations) were viewed with sympathy, as it "gave hope to humanity" by establishing a "valuable, civilized country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. However, for the last 20 years, particularly since the rise of Netanyahu and the "terrorist mentality" of Menachem Begin, Israel has taken a "completely different path," becoming "the prisoner of a culture full of incredible hatred" that views oppression as its right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. While acknowledging Israel's existence under threat, the question is posed: "how long can a country exist only through continuous and endless oppression?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

Comparing the Israeli-Palestinian situation to historical conquests by Arabs in the Middle East, the speaker argues that past oppressions "do not excuse today's oppressions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. The fundamental issue is that "there were people sitting here" and "there is no reasonable reason for these people to be expelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. If expulsion were a solution, it could "much more strongly" be applied to Israeli Jews, suggesting their potential relocation to places like the US, Canada, or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Context
The current conflict is seen as part of a larger "global hegemony war" waged by America and its allies against a worldwide hegemony led by Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The speaker suggests that the [[the_current_state_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] is quietly nearing its end, with Western alliance managers preparing to propose a solution to Russia as the Ukrainian army has "completely disintegrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Russia's likely demands include Ukraine accepting territorial losses (four provinces besides Crimea), having its sea connection cut off, military disarmament, and a new regime established under Russian auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Russia might also demand the demilitarization of the Baltic Republics, with NATO military units and facilities withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

The North Atlantic [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | NATO]] alliance's future is questioned after the "fiasco in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | NATO]] has been noticeably silent regarding the Israeli-Palestinian incident, with America and England acting independently by assembling fleets and sending aircraft squadrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. This might be due to [[turkeys_foreign_policy_and_relations_with_israel_and_palestine | Türkiye]]'s opposition to Israel, which as a [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | NATO]] member, could veto any [[impact_of_great_power_dynamics_on_middle_east_conflicts | NATO]] decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

The speaker believes that the "great revolution" of the 21st century has already started in [[current_geopolitical_conflicts_including_the_ukraine_and_gaza | Ukraine]] and may continue in Palestine, [[israeliran_tensions_and_global_geopolitics | Iran]], and similar places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. This revolution requires the breaking of "central control mechanisms" and global hegemony, "if necessary, through war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

## Prognosis for Israel
The speaker expresses doubt that Israel can "overcome this crisis in the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This aligns with external speculation, with questions posed about the viability of the state of Israel in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

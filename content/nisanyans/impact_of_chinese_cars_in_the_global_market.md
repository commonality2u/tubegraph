The most significant worldwide event of 2023, excluding TÃ¼rkiye, was the substantial success of Chinese cars in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Sales Growth and Market Invasion
Chinese car sales have nearly doubled for two consecutive years, reaching approximately 6 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. These vehicles, described as cheaper, more reliable, and more solid, have notably "invaded" markets across Europe, including both Eastern and Western Europe and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Impact on Established Automotive Industries
The rise of Chinese automotive exports is expected to have very serious consequences globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The American automobile industry collapsed years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Europe, particularly Germany, traditionally dominated the world automobile market, with its economic success heavily reliant on major automotive companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, and Opel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. There is a significant question mark over how these European companies will cope with the intense competition from high-quality Chinese cars flooding the European market, especially given rising energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

This development is seen as an important turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The overall [[2023_global_economic_and_political_events | global economic and political events]] of 2023 suggest a significant economic, demographic, and military turning point worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It is crucial to understand these shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

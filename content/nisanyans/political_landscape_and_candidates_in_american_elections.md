The [[american_elections_and_trump | American elections]] and political landscape are currently undergoing significant shifts.

## Presidential Candidates and Dynamics

It was announced that Biden has withdrawn his candidacy for President, leading to an expected fierce fight for the candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Kamala Harris is anticipated to be the Democratic candidate due to a perceived lack of other viable nominees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The ability to nominate a completely unexpected or unheard-of candidate is not commonly observed within the existing political framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Vice Presidential Candidate: JD Vance

JD Vance has been declared [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. A movie titled "Hillbilly" exists about Vance's life and autobiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The term "hillbilly" refers to a group residing around the Appalachian Mountains in Kentucky, often perceived as somewhat backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Vance is notably considered the first person since the early 20th century to emerge from the American working or poor class to become a candidate for President or Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This contrasts with the 1930s-1950s, when it was more common for candidates to come from rural, small middle-class, or farm business owner backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Over the last 30-40 years, presidential and vice-presidential candidates have typically originated from the wealthiest, established segments of society or the upper bureaucracy/technocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Vance's candidacy is seen as a new and potentially successful choice for the Vice Presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

Unlike other political figures, [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] is noted for not eliciting a strong negative sentiment across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. JD Vance, similarly, can be criticized but is not widely hated, in contrast to figures like Kamala Harris or Biden, who face strong rejection from a significant portion of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It is estimated that Vance could become a very important leading figure in world politics for the next 8-12 years, making his biography essential to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. His story is described as an "American Dream" clich√©, but a successful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Biden's Withdrawal and Campaign Strategy

Biden's withdrawal was anticipated, as key figures in the Democratic Party, especially those controlling financial resources, appeared to realize his campaign was a "fiasco" after his debate with [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. His Alzheimer's symptoms were apparent four years prior when he was elected in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. The delay in his withdrawal is believed to be related to calculations involving Kamala Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. While Kamala Harris faces challenges in winning an election, she is seen as the type of President the Democratic Party establishment desires due to her lack of a strong political base, power, team, or principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

## Alleged [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] Assassination Attempt and Broader Implications

The alleged assassination attempt on [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] is seen as surprisingly open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. The ease with which the supposed amateur shooter operated and the lack of immediate intervention by security suggest a deliberate manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. The assailant, described as a 20-year-old amateur, clearly missed his target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. This incident is interpreted as a sign of the declining caliber of the American deep state since 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

Several unusual occurrences surrounding the event are highlighted:
*   Pre-announcement of the assassination: Statements by President Biden and high-level officials days or weeks prior hinted at a change in the political balance and [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s diminishing chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   Media presence: Mainstream media, which had not attended any of [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s rallies this year, all sent their most reliable reporters to the Pennsylvania rally on the day of the assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. A New York Times reporter even brought a camera and took nano-second photos, capturing the bullet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   Biden's schedule: President Biden, who announced a 4-day vacation, was reportedly at the White House on Saturday holding a top-level meeting in the crisis room at the time of the rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
*   Nikki Haley's unexpected invitation: Nikki Haley, a Republican candidate equivalent to Kamala Harris and a representative of the system, was deliberately not invited to the Republican Party Convention by [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. However, the day before the assassination, she was hastily invited and given a critical speaking slot at the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. This is seen as part of a plan for her to make a unifying speech after [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] was shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

These events, including the media's presence, the shooter's amateur nature, the police's apparent negligence, and the alleged dismissal of [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s security team, suggest a "rotten to the core" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The speaker concludes that such obvious clues would not be left if a true, sophisticated assassination were planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This is attributed to the increasing stupidity within growing bureaucracies, which make even simple tasks impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. The [[challenges_in_american_bureaucratic_and_political_systems | American deep state]] is believed to have knowingly and willingly botched the assassination attempt due to its incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This is paralleled with the mishandling of the Covid issue, citing an instance where Biden, allegedly Covid-positive, did not wear a mask and shook hands with soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

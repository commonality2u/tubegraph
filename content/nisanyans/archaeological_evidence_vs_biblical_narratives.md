The study of archaeological and historical records provides a contrasting perspective to the narratives presented in biblical texts, particularly concerning the early history of the Jewish people and the formation of their religious tenets.

## Early History and Egyptian Absence
Archaeological records from the period around 1000 BC offer insights into the historical context of ancient Israel and its kingdoms. Notably, Egyptian sources, which are [[Historical Perspectives on Empires and Cultural Narratives | rich and literate]], contain no information about the Jews being in or leaving Egypt, nor the slightest indication of such an event at the time described in biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Around 1000 BC, during the period traditionally associated with David and Solomon, Jerusalem was a small shepherd's settlement, consisting of only about 30 households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Furthermore, Hebrew script had not yet emerged, appearing much later, around 700-800 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Emergence of Kingdoms and Scriptural Formation
A highly developed kingdom emerged in the northern area of present-day Israel around 800 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This kingdom had significant cult centers, a rich aristocratic and royal class, and was prosperous for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It was ultimately destroyed by the Assyrians in 712 BC, its people exiled to the region of modern Mosul, and the area became an Assyrian colony, resettled by non-Hebrew tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Following this, Jerusalem experienced a fivefold population increase around 712 BC, becoming an important city and the center of a new kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This kingdom played a significant [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | political role]] as a buffer state between Assyria and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It flourished under King Manasseh, who established a profitable alliance with Assyria, becoming a major source of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. During this period, archeological evidence shows the emergence of seriously rich houses in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

After the collapse of Assyria and the rise of Babylon, Jerusalem continued to play a strategic role, aligning sometimes with Egypt and sometimes with Babylon, until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Kings and Textual Development
Key figures in this period, whose reigns coincided with the formation of the *Torah* (or Pentateuch) narrative, include:

*   **King Hezekiah** (reigned 75-686 BC): Extensively documented in both the *Torah* and external Egyptian and Assyrian sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. His era saw a significant population influx into Jerusalem, likely from the northern kingdom, and the first recorded mention of the deity "Yahweh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This period is understood as the primary formation period of the *Torah* narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The prophet Isaiah, a key ideologist of King Hezekiah's government, was the first to introduce the concept of the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **King Manasseh** (reigned 686-642 BC): Portrayed negatively in the *Torah* as a king who abandoned monotheism for foreign gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, archaeological and historical data indicate his reign was a period of significant wealth and prosperity, stemming from an alliance with Assyria and a flourishing olive oil trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **King Josiah**: Initiated a radical religious reform, akin to a "Wahhabism movement," eliminating provincial shrines and local temples, and consolidating worship in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He pursued an imperial policy, conquering the northern territories as the Assyrian state collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The prophet Jeremiah, described as a "Middle Eastern fanatic," served as Josiah's chief ideological officer, advocating for the punishment of idolaters and the destruction of non-Yahweh temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The prophet Jeremiah's "Lament" is interpreted as a defense against criticism that his religious reforms led to the Babylonian destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Formation of Biblical Texts and Polemics
The main teachings and body of the *Torah* texts are understood to have been created during the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. These texts responded to the political needs and polemics of that period, particularly the conflict between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

For example, contradictions exist within the *Torah* itself regarding the Canaanites. While one part claims the Israelites completely slaughtered the Canaanites upon entering the holy land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, other sections indicate that Canaanite cities and kings still existed hundreds of years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. These discrepancies are interpreted as [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | polemics]] between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, with "northerners" often blamed for incomplete conquests and worshipping foreign gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The Southern Kingdom, being poorer, used this narrative to establish its dominance in mythical history over the historically older and richer Northern Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The narratives about David and Solomon, often described as mythical ancestors, served to provide an official history for the Southern kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Following the destruction of the Northern Kingdom and the migration of some of its people south, a new state ideology was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This led to the story of King Josiah building the Temple, destroying other temples, and "discovering" the book of laws within the Temple, which then retroactively validated earlier figures like Moses and his mandates for a single temple and sacrificial rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

Regarding the Exodus narrative, while some speculate a small-scale event not recorded by Egyptians, the names of Moses and his family (Amram, Maryam, Aaron) are not Hebrew but likely Egyptian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The story of Moses growing up in the Egyptian palace further points to an Egyptian connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50] মিনি</a>. This narrative may reflect a need to link the Jewish people to Egypt due to historical diplomatic maneuvers or Egypt's past occupation of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The narrative of "ancestors defeating the Egyptians" also carries a clear [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | political meaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Monotheism and Cultural Influence
The *Torah* continually emphasizes the punishment for worshipping foreign gods (Babylonians, Phoenicians, Philistines, Canaanites, Assyrians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This suggests that polytheism was a common practice, serving as a diplomatic tool for alliances and trade, where taking a queen or engaging in commerce meant adopting or respecting their gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. The continuous "cleaning of idols" by various kings and prophets suggests that the shift to radical monotheism was a complex and ongoing process, not a simple, immediate conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

## Archaeological Contradictions of Origin Narratives
One of the most significant findings in archaeology is the lack of a discernible difference between Canaanites and Israelites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. The biblical narrative of Israelites conquering Canaan by force around 1000 BC has no archaeological basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. Their languages were the same, and there is no trace of widespread destruction of cities that would indicate an ethnic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This contrasts with the *Torah*'s story of Abraham's arrival, the departure from Egypt, and subsequent conquest of Canaan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.

Such narratives are understood as mythological stories, some drawing from Sumerian mythology (e.g., the Noah flood story) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

Modern analysis of biblical narratives, supported by archaeological evidence and examination of neighboring country records, suggests that these texts, while sacred, were skillfully constructed over time (within about 200 years) as a political and cultural ideological narrative to support the establishment of a new, single-centered cult and to define a new state ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. This approach allows for a "very elegant step in the struggle between reason and religion," without rejecting faith, but rather by framing the origins of religious narratives within a verifiable historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Similar studies are more extensively developed for Christianity than for Judaism, and are beginning to emerge for Islam in Western scholarship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

### Limited Evidence in Zoroastrianism
The Avesta, the primary collection of Zoroastrian texts, was reportedly transmitted orally for a long time and only came into written form much later than Islam, specifically during the last period of the Sassanids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. The oldest existing texts, the Bombay Parsi texts, date back to only a thousand years before Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

The hymns called *gatas*, written in an older Avestan language, are believed to belong to 1200 BC, but there are uncertainties about the full Avestan text's creation date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.# Archaeological Evidence vs. Biblical Narratives

The study of archaeological and historical records provides a contrasting perspective to the narratives presented in biblical texts, particularly concerning the early history of the Jewish people and the formation of their religious tenets.

## Early History and Egyptian Absence
Archaeological records from the period around 1000 BC offer insights into the [[Historical context of ancient Israel and its kingdoms | historical context of ancient Israel and its kingdoms]]. Notably, Egyptian sources, which are quite rich and highly literate, contain no information about the Jews being in or leaving Egypt, nor the slightest indication of such an event at the time described in biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Around 1000 BC, during the period traditionally associated with David and Solomon, Jerusalem was a small shepherd's settlement, consisting of only about 30 households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Furthermore, Hebrew script had not yet emerged, appearing much later, around 700-800 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Emergence of Kingdoms and Scriptural Formation

This kingdom had significant cult centers, a rich aristocratic and royal class, and was prosperous for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It was ultimately destroyed by the Assyrians in 712 BC, its people exiled to the region of modern Mosul, and the area became an Assyrian colony, resettled by non-Hebrew tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Following this, Jerusalem experienced a fivefold population increase around 712 BC, becoming an important city and the center of a new kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This kingdom played a significant [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | political role]] as a buffer state in the fight between Assyria in the north and Egypt in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It flourished under King Manasseh, who established a profitable relationship with the Assyrians, becoming a major source of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. During this period, archaeological evidence shows the emergence of seriously rich houses in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

After the collapse of Assyria and the rise of Babylon, Jerusalem continued to play a strategic role, aligning sometimes with Egypt and sometimes with Babylon, until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Kings and Textual Development
Key figures in this period, whose reigns coincided with the formation of the *Torah* (or Pentateuch) narrative, include:

*   **King Hezekiah** (reigned 75-686 BC): Extensively documented in both the *Torah* and external Egyptian and Assyrian sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. His era saw a significant population influx into Jerusalem, likely from the northern kingdom, and the first recorded mention of the deity "Yahweh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This period is understood as the primary formation period of the *Torah* narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The prophet Isaiah, a key ideologist of King Hezekiah's government, was the first to introduce the concept of the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **King Manasseh** (reigned 686-642 BC): Portrayed negatively in the *Torah* as a king who abandoned monotheism for foreign gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, archaeological and historical data indicate his reign was a period of significant wealth and prosperity, stemming from an alliance with Assyria and a flourishing olive oil trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **King Josiah**: Initiated a radical religious reform, akin to a "Wahhabism movement," eliminating provincial shrines and local temples, and consolidating worship in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He pursued an imperial policy, conquering the northern territories as the Assyrian state collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:34">[0:08:34]</a>. The prophet Jeremiah, described as a "Middle Eastern fanatic," served as Josiah's chief ideological officer, advocating for the punishment of idolaters and the destruction of non-Yahweh temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The prophet Jeremiah's "Lament" is interpreted as a defense against criticism that his religious reforms led to the Babylonian destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Formation of Biblical Texts and Polemics
The main teachings and body of the *Torah* texts are understood to have been created during the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. These texts responded to the political needs and polemics of that period, particularly the conflict between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

For example, contradictions exist within the *Torah* itself regarding the Canaanites. While one part claims the Israelites completely slaughtered the Canaanites upon entering the holy land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, other sections indicate that Canaanite cities and kings still existed hundreds of years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. These discrepancies are interpreted as [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | polemics]] between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, with "northerners" often blamed for incomplete conquests and worshipping foreign gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The Southern Kingdom, being poorer, used this narrative to establish its dominance in mythical history over the historically older and richer Northern Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The narratives about David and Solomon, often described as mythical ancestors, served to provide an official history for the Southern kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Following the destruction of the Northern Kingdom and the migration of some of its people south, a new state ideology was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This led to the story of King Josiah building the Temple, destroying other temples, and "discovering" the book of laws within the Temple, which then retroactively validated earlier figures like Moses and his mandates for a single temple and sacrificial rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

Regarding the Exodus narrative, while some speculate a small-scale event not recorded by Egyptians, the names of Moses and his family (Amram, Maryam, Aaron) are not Hebrew but likely Egyptian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The story of Moses growing up in the Egyptian palace further points to an Egyptian connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This narrative may reflect a need to link the Jewish people to Egypt due to historical diplomatic maneuvers or Egypt's past occupation of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The narrative of "ancestors defeating the Egyptians" also carries a clear [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | political meaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Monotheism and Cultural Influence
The *Torah* continually emphasizes the punishment for worshipping foreign gods (Babylonians, Phoenicians, Philistines, Canaanites, Assyrians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Archaeological Contradictions of Origin Narratives
One of the most significant findings in archaeology is the lack of a discernible difference between Canaanites and Israelites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

Modern analysis of biblical narratives, supported by archaeological evidence and examination of neighboring country records, suggests that these texts, while sacred, were skillfully constructed over time (within about 200 years) as a [[Sociopolitical elements within biblical stories | political and cultural ideological narrative]] to support the establishment of a new, single-centered cult and to define a new state ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. This approach allows for a "very elegant step in the struggle between reason and religion," without rejecting faith, but rather by framing the origins of religious narratives within a verifiable historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### Limited Evidence in Zoroastrianism
The Avesta, the primary collection of Zoroastrian texts, was reportedly transmitted orally for a long time and only came into written form much later than Islam, specifically during the last period of the Sassanids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

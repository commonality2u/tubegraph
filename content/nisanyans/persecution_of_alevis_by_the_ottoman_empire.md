Alevism, as it is known today, began to crystallize in the 1400s and came to prominence in the 15th and early 16th centuries, with a revolutionary movement started by the Safavid dynasty in Ardabil, Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This movement, initiated by Aydar, Cüneyt, Haydar, and later Shah Ismail, was a protest against classical Islam and a religious reform movement against Sunni Islam, coinciding interestingly with the Protestant Reformation in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Ottoman Suppression and Ideological Conflict
The Alevi movement reached a point where it threatened the existence of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Originating in the last years of Fatih Sultan Mehmet's reign and tending to spiral out of control during Beyazıt II's rule, it was violently suppressed during Yavuz Selim's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The Ottoman state perceived this movement as a "deadly danger ideologically" and "the devil himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

For centuries, the Ottomans ruthlessly suppressed the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This involved:
*   Crushing the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Exiling Alevis to the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Killing those declared illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Using all oppressive tools to destroy Alevism, characteristic of a totalitarian and authoritarian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

While the intensity of this suppression decreased somewhat by the 18th century, a violent persecution of Alevis and Bektashis resumed in the 19th century, particularly during the suppression of the Janissary Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Consequences of Persecution
Alevis never had good relations with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. As a result, they:
*   Lived illegally wherever they were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Fled to mountainous and remote areas beyond Ottoman control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Were constantly oppressed and forced to hide their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   Always had to worship secretly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Reasons for Ottoman Hostility
The fundamental symptom of Alevi identity was its resistance against Islamic bigotry, Islamic law (Sharia), and the Sunni Islam model imposed by the Ottoman ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The Alevi movement actively rejected core Islamic practices and principles as defined by Sunni orthodoxy, such as:
*   Fasting (or practiced it differently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   Sharia rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   Pilgrimage (Hajj) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   Zakat (charity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Despite rejecting these fundamental rules, Alevis defined themselves as Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. They considered the first four caliphs, except Ali, to be illegal usurpers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. They believed Ali was the true successor to Muhammad, followed by the 12 Imams from his lineage, who they accepted as the true representatives of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

This inherent opposition to the state-sanctioned Sunni ideology, coupled with a refusal to adhere to traditional Islamic legal frameworks, marked Alevis as "infidels" in the eyes of the Ottoman state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. The prevailing Ottoman conditions until the mid-19th century meant that converting away from Islam was punishable by death, leaving those in disagreement with mainstream Islam with limited options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. This often led to nominally remaining Muslim but joining anti-establishment movements, such as Alevism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

## Impact on Alevi Identity
The historical persecution led to [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | Alevism]] evolving into a "patchwork" of various traditions and elements, united by a common theme of

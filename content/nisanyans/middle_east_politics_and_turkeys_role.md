## Turkey-Russia Relations and Syria

There is no apparent or logical reason for a Turkish-Russian war, as there are no serious contradictions between the strategic goals of the two parties, nor any significant reason for mutual fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. Turkish-Russian relations have been at their best in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. Crises typically arose when [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey intervened in Syria]], leading to near-conflict situations, such as the shooting down of a plane and mutual trade sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>. However, the Syria issue seems to have been resolved, with an understanding or agreement intention prevailing between Syria, Turkey, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. If no major explosion occurs in Syria, relations between Turkey and Russia are currently optimal, which is beneficial for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

To prevent a potential Turkish-Russian war, the most crucial measures are to avoid new adventures in Syria and for Turkey to maintain its relative autonomy or ambiguous position regarding NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## The Rise of Political Islam in Turkey: Internal Dynamics and External Influences

The question arises whether anti-communist practices by NATO and the CIA, such as the "Green Belt" strategy, contributed to Turkey becoming more religious and falling under the influence of political Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. While such practices likely had an effect, they were not the sole or primary cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

Turkey's Islam emerged from the underground in two main stages:
*   **Post-1980s (Kenan Evren period):** Traces of a [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | global strategy implemented by America]] across the Islamic world are visible here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. Especially after the Iranian Revolution, a controlled spread of Islamic discourse in Turkey was favored to prevent a similar fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This policy was also implemented in Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, and other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Post-2002 (Recep Tayyip Erdoğan period):** This is largely seen as a natural result of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. If a country moves from governance by a small oligarchy or single-party system to one where the entire society has voting rights and party competition is relatively free, parties will cater to people's feelings, prejudices, and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. This naturally leads to Islamic sentiments coming to the forefront over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. American decision-makers understood that Islam would rise and aimed to keep it under control to prevent identifying the regime with Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. This initial strategy was considered rational and correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

## Turkey's Ambition as a Regional Power in the Middle East

If [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey]] is to act as a subcontractor and representative of the Western world in the Arab Middle East, playing a patronage and big brother role, it must prioritize the cultures and prejudices of not only Turks but also Arabs, Persians, and Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. To become a regional power, it's necessary to win over the populace of the East, not just Turkey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

### Historical Context: Ottoman Expansion into the Middle East

This has happened several times in [[political_history_of_Turkey | Turkey's history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. In the early 16th century, due to internal security concerns, competition with Iran, and the collapse of Egypt, Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered the entire Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, which had previously focused on expansion into the Balkans, turned eastward to avoid being attacked from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. Conquering and integrating Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, and Eastern Turkey meant not just military conquest but governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. Governance required making the conquered populations feel accepted, respected, and part of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.

Consequently, from the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire rapidly and violently Islamized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Madrasahs were established, mosques built, and the Ottoman language, formerly proper Turkish, became a mix of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. This was because the empire became one where Turks, Arabs, and Kurds shared governance, necessitating respect for Middle Eastern culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

### The 2000s and the "Arab Spring" Fiasco

A similar project was on the agenda in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. The early 2000s were a period of great promise for Turkey, with its reputation in the Arab world being very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. To engage with Arabs, knowing Arabic, having Arabic teachers at universities, and taking Islam more seriously were deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. This policy aimed to create a regional power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.

However, this policy ended in a complete fiasco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. The so-called Arab Spring shattered Turkey's dream of becoming a regional sovereign power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Syria was shattered, and other Arab regimes were drawn into different crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. This effort yielded no positive result, and Turkey made a significant mistake in Syria, particularly under the leadership of Ahmet Davutoğlu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.

## Regional Modernization: Saudi Arabia and Iran

The concept of modernization might need to move away from the 20th-century paradigm that equates it with secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia is rapidly developing and breaking its traditional social structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. This transformation became clearly visible with Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power, starting as a radical project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. Since the 1950s and 60s, especially after the 1973 oil embargo, Saudi Arabia became incredibly wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. While attempting to maintain a conservative structure, influential individuals sent their children to the West for education, bringing back new ideas and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. As a conservative country, Saudi Arabia progressed slowly and cautiously, but now the balance is rapidly shifting towards a cosmopolitan structure and worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. Despite this, at a verbal level, they show no signs of abandoning Islamic ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. The question of whether a country can both modernize and remain non-secular is a 21st-century issue; the 20th-century equation of modernization equaling secularization and Westernization is no longer valid, as there are many different modernities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>.

### Iran
Iran also presents a unique case of modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>. While the controlled media may present a different narrative, visiting Iran reveals a society that has significantly improved its standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>. Despite issues like the state's imposition of a dress code, the regime has successfully transformed a terribly class-divided society (wealthy elite vs. medieval peasants) by raising education levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Unlike Turkey, visitors often encounter an extremely polite, well-mannered, smiling, and hospitable population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>. Notably, 60% of university students in Iran are women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>. Despite its problems, the Iranian regime appears more successful than Turkey in terms of general welfare and happiness over the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. Although there is public frustration with the "ideological police" and "Mullah mafia," similar to the Soviet Union in the 1980s, Iran is clearly a healthier society than Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

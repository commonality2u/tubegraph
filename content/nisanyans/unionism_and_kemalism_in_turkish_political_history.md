The relationship between Unionism and Kemalism in [[political_history_of_turkey | Turkish political history]] is a subject of ongoing discussion. According to one perspective, these two movements, while belonging to different eras, are fundamentally the same political and ideological tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:39">[03:34:39]</a>.

## Unionism: The Young Turkish Ideology

Unionism originated as the Young Turkish ideology, representing the state and community understanding of the Ottoman State's Muslim ruling classes, who faced the possibility of collapse and annihilation from the early 19th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This period, particularly during Abdulhamid's reign and before, fostered a widespread psychology of defeat in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. A significant generation gap emerged, as Abdulhamid's oppressive regime prevented the renewal of cadres, leading to a very old and conservative leadership by 1908-1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

Young, educated cadres, excluded from power, suddenly rose in 1908-1914, perceiving the collapse of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. The Unionist regime came to power as a "cry for liberation," with all Muslim cadres in Türkiye who had any education uniting around this political movement by 1913-1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. It was a movement that achieved power unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

The basic principles of Unionism were:
*   **Muslim Society**: The belief that they existed as a Muslim ruling class in a society where a large proportion, until recently and even in 1910, was non-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. They concluded that this Muslim ruling class must govern for the system to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   **Modernization and Islam**: They recognized that they had fallen behind Europe and needed to adopt the secrets of new civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Their national identity was indisputably Islam, and they aimed to cleanse it of "reactionary, outdated, lethargic" elements to stand up again as a Muslim society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This meant taking anything from Europe – technology, culture, art, military – to maintain their existence as a Muslim ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Non-Muslims**: A core principle was that the presence of non-Muslims in the country was an obstacle to this project, and therefore, they "must destroy them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Kemalism: A Continuation and Adaptation

The cadres of Unionism were the same ones who came to power again in 1919, forming the financial, monetary, and organizational foundations of the national struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. However, they faced new realities after World War I:
*   A large part of the empire was lost, and there was no significant non-Muslim population left in the remaining territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This removed the agenda item of "cleaning the non-Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   The Western states (England, France, and the United States) were the "indisputable sovereigns of the new world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Thus, getting along with them was necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   To make the "greatest crimes against humanity in modern history" forgotten and forgiven, good relations with Western states were essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

This new atmosphere meant continuing the same Unionist project in a new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

### The Dual Nature of Kemalism

A common mistake identifies [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalist ideology]] solely with Westernization and secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. However, the ideological foundations of the [[cultural_and_social_divisions_in_trkiye_related_to_kemalism | Kemalist movement]] are "forked-tongued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>:

> "The essence of Kemalism is to defeat the seven powers, the homeland, the nation... it is a Muslim movement and is based on Muslim nationalism." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>
>
> "Kemalism is also directed towards the western states and the elites of Istanbul and Izmir. In order to steal a finger of honey from their mouths, an image of westernization has been presented. A discourse of westernization has been presented." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>

The project of secularism was put forward to "silence the voices of the conservative segments within the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Kemalism operated on "two legs and two rails" in the 1920s and 1930s: "homeland, nation, Sakarya" on one side, and "modernity, secularism, Westernism" on the other, with both coexisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. In the project of raising new generations, especially within the [[kemalism_and_critique_of_turkish_education_system | education system]], the emphasis on "homeland, nation, Sakarya" was predominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

## Historical Continuity and Evolution

Despite superficial differences, Kemalism's basis is the same as Unionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Fundamentally, both are continuations of the Ottoman imperial ideology, adapted to the conditions of the new age, with "no rupture" at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. This perspective views [[mustafa_kemals_policies_and_legacy | Mustafa Kemal's policies and legacy]] as an evolution rather than a complete break from past ideologies.

In contemporary Turkey, a proposed dichotomy exists between "Islamist authoritarianism" (associated with the AKP and Tayyip Erdoğan) and "ethnic nationalist totalitarianism" (described as the "Kemalist Unionist alliance" or "nationalist Fascism") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. However, it is argued that both ideologies have entered a period of stagnation and decline, with Turkish society moving towards apoliticization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. The political landscape is seen as dominated by state institutions, particularly security forces, which can make adjustments within the government without consulting external parties, leaving little room for opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

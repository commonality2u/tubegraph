İsmet İnönü, a prominent figure in the history of the Republic, served as Prime Minister under [[nns_relationship_with_atatrk_and_turkish_political_landscape | Atatürk]] and later became President. His administration faced numerous [[challenges_and_strategies_in_political_leadership | challenges and strategies in political leadership]], both domestic and international, shaping the course of Turkish politics and society.

## Leadership and Political Stance

İnönü was characterized as a manager without a grand vision or a desire to discuss one, unlike a megalomaniac or someone with strong ideological obsessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. He reportedly kept his distance from Turkism movements that spread after 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. His actions, such as breaking the pro-Nazi structure in Turkey with 2942 arrests, turned the existing enmity between Turkists and people like Reşit Galip's Turkish Hearths school into a "blood feud to the death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This established a major cleavage line in Turkish politics after 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

While he shared the values and goals of the revolutionary regime, he often prioritized stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. He played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the 1925 Kurdish rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. However, he was dismissed from office and politically condemned for daring to contradict Atatürk regarding the 1936 Dersim Rebellion, where he argued for moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. His sincere interest in Western culture and law differed from Atatürk's more performative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

### Post-Atatürk Era

Upon assuming leadership, İnönü made significant political statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. It was during his time that figures like Karabekir, Rauf Orbay, Halide Edip, and Mehmet Akif Ersoy, once considered "traitors," became "national heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. In 1938, Atatürk's picture was removed from currency and other public places, possibly as a step towards erasing the influence of a 15-year period of "power intoxication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. However, the "cult of the founder God" was later revived and spread more intensely after 1950 and especially after 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Economic Policies

İnönü's economic policies were initially cautious and "arrested," reflecting his deep understanding of the state's financial weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. He was accused of being strict and even cowardly in the 1930s and 40s regarding finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. After 1946, with the opening of credit lines from the United States, he gave the green light for rapid economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. He did not pursue flashy symbolic reforms but rather supported practical "revolutions" like planting tea in Rize and bananas in Anamur, as well as eradicating Menemen and malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

## World War II Stance and Aftermath

A significant challenge of İnönü's administration was navigating [[nns_stance_during_world_war_ii | Turkey's stance during World War II]]. The country was kept out of the disaster of the two World Wars, which is considered a significant achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Non-Intervention
*   **Military Weakness**: The Turkish army in 1940 was described as being in a "miserable desert" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Entering the war on the Allies' side would have been a liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Involvement**: The examples of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which suffered immensely during and after the war, highlighted the potential devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Strategy**: Turkey pursued a "two-faced policy" during the war, managing relations with both the British and Americans while preventing Germany from gaining influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. A key concern was preventing Germany from entering the war on its side, specifically by preventing the sale of strategic minerals like chrome from Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

### Domestic Impact of War Years
The war years were associated with hardship for the people, including bread sold with ration cards, forced labor for peasants, and military pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. However, the suffering of Turkish peasants was considered "a drop in the ocean" compared to that in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, or the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

A notable paradox is that World War I, despite causing immense losses, is remembered with "good intentions," while World War II, "overcome with ration cards," made its administrators objects of hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. This difference might be attributed to the "plunder and tremendous wealth transfer" that occurred during World War I, benefiting certain segments of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. The "genocide and plunder policies of the Union and Progress regime" during WWI, despite the country's devastation, might have provided a "raw food" distraction by directing public anger towards an external "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

In contrast, the Wealth Tax of 1942 and the conscription of 20-22 year olds during WWII indicate a similar, though perhaps less successful, policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. The fact that these policies were not fully carried out is possibly attributed to İnönü's cautious personality and the lack of opportunity for further plunder, particularly of non-Muslims, who had already been significantly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

### Treatment of Non-Muslims
During the war, non-Muslim male populations were taken to concentration camps twice in two years, a "very strange behavior" compared to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. This severe approach indicated a "government with its eyes darkened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

A policy of gathering the non-Muslim population in Istanbul was implemented, with Jewish populations outside Istanbul expelled in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. This was done under the pretext of an impending war and potential German demands for Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. Gangs attacked Jewish shops, and local authorities often refused protection, leading to their migration to Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. Armenian communities in Anatolia were also "purified" during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. The exact balance between "stupidity, racism, and hostility" versus perceived "rationality" for state survival in these policies remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

## Post-1950 Career and Political Struggles

After 1950, İnönü became the first, and perhaps only, "National Chief" to leave power through an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. During the 1960s, despite being in the "road to Heaven," his authority influenced the 27 May coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. He played a significant role in braking the radical Nasserist tendencies within the coup leadership, leading to a softer, "half-baked" transition to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

However, his later career was marked by negative actions, such as his "town politician fights" with Demirel, support for military sentences in 1971, and his struggle against Ecevit to retain office at 87 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. These actions not only damaged his reputation but also contributed to the "fossilization" and deadlock of major positions in Turkish politics that persist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

### Conflict with Talat Aydemir
İnönü's conflict with Talat Aydemir stemmed from the internal divisions within the army after the 1960 military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. Two main tendencies existed:
1.  **Radical Revolutionary**: Led by figures like Alparslan Türkeş and Talat Aydemir, this group believed civilians were incapable of governing and advocated for military leadership, willing to use force to establish a "modern civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This tendency was influenced by [[smet_nns_political_and_economic_policies | National Socialist]] and Arab nationalist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
2.  **Institutionalist**: Represented by figures like Cemal Gürsel and Madanoğlu, this group aimed to dismiss the Democrat Party for losing control, clean up the system, and then return to a party order aligned with the NATO alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

İnönü clearly sided with the latter, leading to the purging of radical revolutionary officers from the National Unity Committee in October 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. Despite this, attempts at coups and the formation of secret political organizations within the army continued until 1980, keeping Turkey in a state of constant tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. This "dark curtain" only closed after the September 12, 1980, coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

## The Mystery of İnönü's Ascension to Power

A significant enigma in the history of the Republic is İnönü's unanimous election as president the day after Atatürk's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. İnönü had been removed from the Prime Ministry in October 1937 and effectively erased from public life, with his name becoming dangerous to mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. Despite being under police surveillance, he was suddenly the clear choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

The process by which highly ambitious and powerful individuals reached this consensus, without any apparent public discussion or prior arrangement, remains unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. It suggests a decision was made well before Atatürk's death, given the impossibility of such a rapid consensus within 24 hours of his passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.

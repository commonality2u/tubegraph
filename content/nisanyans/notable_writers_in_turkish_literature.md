## Fuzuli

Fuzuli is considered by the speaker to be the foremost writer in Turkish literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. His work is described as "magnificent" and placing him in the "world's A leagues" of literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He is regarded as the only Turkish author capable of competing with ancient Latin poets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Contrary to textbook depictions of a "swaggering beard" or an overly religious figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, Fuzuli is characterized as:
*   Incredibly intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Possessing an extremely strong ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Crafting poems "like jewels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Exhibiting sharp intelligence in his writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Staying focused within the framework of his subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Known for his use of irony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Appreciating Fuzuli requires an [[publishing_and_literature_in_istanbul_during_early_20th_century | Ottoman education]] and familiarity with that culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Contemporary Turkish Literature

The speaker admits to not knowing who the notable writers of the 20th and 21st centuries are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, stating that he reads every novel published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> While acknowledging some criticisms such as a slow tempo after the first episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, the speaker dismisses criticism based on a lack of alignment with one's "social understanding and political preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Such criticism is deemed not serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, as a literary work does not have to conform to personal preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Oral Literature and Epics

The discussion touches upon the nature of literature before written culture, particularly epic poems:

### *Beowulf*
This Anglo-Saxon epic, from the 8th or 9th century, is considered the first work of English literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. It is described as "very creepy" and "very beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>, offering a different tone and voice from written literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. It's a simple heroic story about a monster threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

### *Dede Korkut*
The tales of *Dede Korkut* are highly recommended and considered "works that must be read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Characteristics of Pre-Written Literature
> Works from the period before the concept of a "writer" formed, when literature was primarily transmitted orally, exhibit a different character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>. These works:
> *   Do not feature the "weak voice of the individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>.
> *   Contain "high words" with a "divine quality" or "sacred unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>.
> *   Are presented as "objective stories," not told by a specific person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>.
> This feeling is also found in the works of Homer, the Torah, to a certain extent the Quran, and Indian epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. All are works formed at the transition point to written culture, lacking the "selfish and weak voice of the individual" and speaking with a "divine voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

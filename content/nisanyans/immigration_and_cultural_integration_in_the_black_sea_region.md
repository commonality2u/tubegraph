The Black Sea region, particularly its western half, has a distinct demographic and cultural history. Many place names in this area, including those in Kalkandere and Rize, are of Greek origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

## Historical Demographics and Migration Patterns

The overwhelming majority of the population in the western Black Sea region were historically Greeks or Greekized people, primarily members of the Orthodox religion who spoke Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. Since the 6th century, these populations gradually converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. The shift from Greek to Turkish occurred as Turkish was learned in schools, and over generations, children spoke Turkish with peers and their own offspring, leading to the disappearance of Greek if not taught consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.

Mass migration of foreigners into the Black Sea region has been historically impossible due to its limited natural opportunities and the resistance of local populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>. Since the 16th century, significant foreign settlements have not occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. However, some internal [[migration_and_settlement_patterns_in_eastern_anatolia | migration and settlement patterns]] have been observed:
*   In the 17th and 18th centuries, populations migrated from other parts of the Eastern Black Sea, particularly to Sürmene, Çarşamba, and the Kara Dere side of Çayeli, often establishing themselves through conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>.
*   The 19th century saw a significant migration of Greeks, especially from Gümüşhane, to areas with newly opened mines in the Black Sea Mountains, establishing miner communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>. Mining was traditionally a Greek profession in the Ottoman period, particularly for Greeks from the Gümüşhane area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>.

## Identity and Historical Narratives

In Turkey, particularly since the early 20th century, there has been an ideological and psychological disapproval of a Greek past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. This has led many people to fabricate or believe false family histories to conform to prevailing narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. The speaker highlights that while people often tell stories about their ancestry (e.g., coming from Maraş or Khorasan generations ago), it's important to remember that individuals have hundreds of ancestors (e.g., 256 in 8 generations), most of whom would have lived locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>.

## Defining "Türkiyeli"

The word "Türkiyeli" (meaning "from Turkey") has emerged as a distinct category, different from "Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. It refers to:
*   A citizen of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   Someone born in Turkey, even if not a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   Individuals belonging to one or all of the cultures established in Turkey, regardless of self-identification as a Turk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   It encompasses groups like Armenians, Greeks, or Jews who were born in Turkey and are rooted in Turkish culture and background, even if they later moved abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
This category is crucial because many individuals deeply connected to Turkey's [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | cultural dynamics]] would not define themselves as "Turk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Language naturally invents words for needed concepts, and "Türkiyeli" serves this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

## Hostility Towards Arabs

Hostility towards Arabs in Turkey began in the mid-19th century, coinciding with the Tanzimat era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This phenomenon is rooted in a desire by Ottomans and later Turks to align with Western identity. It was a means to assert themselves as respectable and civilized in the eyes of Western Europeans, by distancing themselves from Arabs, who were often stereotyped negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

This sentiment intensified when the Ottoman State's central bureaucracy, educated in Istanbul and adopting Western styles, began administering Arab provinces. These officers often developed an immediate disdain for Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. A notable example is Ahmet Izzet Pasha, an Albanian aristocrat and Western music lover, who during the Yemen War (pre-WWI) captured British classical music records and introduced figures like Ismet Inönü to Western culture, showcasing a cultural affinity with the West despite fighting against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

The current [[migration_and_integration_challenges | hostility towards Syrians]] in Turkey is seen as a manifestation of this deeply ingrained complex, emphasizing a perceived superiority and difference ("we are not them, they are inferior") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[impact_of_historical_migrations_and_cultural_changes_in_anatolia | cultural and ethnic landscape of Turkey]], particularly the Black Sea region, is shaped by historical migrations, religious conversions, and efforts to construct national and cultural identity, often involving complex and sometimes self-deceptive narratives about ancestry and ethnicity.

[[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Kemalism]] is widely observed in Türkiye's coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond coastal regions, its spread to inland areas is attributed to two primary social bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>: [[impact_of_greek_immigrants_on_kemalisms_spread | Greek immigrants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> and [[role_of_educated_classes_in_turkey | educated segments]], particularly civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Civil Servants as a Social Base
A significant social base for [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Kemalism]] consists of segments considered educated by Türkiye's standards, typically civil servants, who have not been significantly exposed to global culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Among these groups, [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Kemalism]] is exceptionally strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It serves to distinguish them from the general populace, whom they perceive as "ignorant people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Migration and Retirement Patterns
Civil servants in Türkiye typically undergo a career path that involves being assigned to various locations across the country, from Çorum to Diyarbakır or Denizli, over a 30-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Upon retirement, many choose to settle in cities like İzmir, Antalya, or Bursa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, these provinces have a very high number of retired civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The influence extends to their children and grandchildren, who are often part of the same social segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Kemalism as a Class Indicator
For these segments, [[unionism_and_kemalism_in_turkish_political_history | Kemalism]] functions as a class indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It conveys a sense of superiority and distinction, asserting that they are "something more valuable" than the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ideology provides them with a feeling of elevated status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

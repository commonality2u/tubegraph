The family discussed in this account has been established in Istanbul for generations, with deep roots in the city's [[armenian_presence_and_cultural_figures_in_istanbul_during_early_1900s | cultural and intellectual life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Intellectual Life and the 1915 Deportation

The speaker's paternal family includes a notable writer and publishing house owner, who was an integral part of Istanbul's [[armenian_presence_and_cultural_figures_in_istanbul_during_early_1900s | cultural and intellectual circles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While the Deportation was not widely enforced in Istanbul, a significant event occurred on April 24, 1915, considered the initial phase of the Deportation in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. During this period, approximately 150-240 individuals were arrested and sent to Anatolia; almost all of them, with the exception of a few, were never heard from again and are presumed to have been killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The speaker's father was among those arrested on April 24, 1915, but was later released after a period of detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Furthermore, one of the individuals exiled at that time sought refuge and hid for a period in the grandfather's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Publishing Endeavors and Post-1922 Return

The family maintained its presence in Istanbul, and the grandfather operated a publishing house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This establishment was particularly known for publishing security translations of renowned modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

In 1922, following the fall of Izmir, a wave of panic swept through Istanbul, leading to the first instance of a mass [[armenian_migration_from_istanbul_to_france_post1922 | migration of Armenians from Istanbul to France]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Unlike 1915, this was a mass exodus of Istanbul Armenians to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The speaker's family, including their father's relatives, also relocated to France, packing onto ships in September 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

After spending two to three years in Paris, the grandfather decided to return to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He re-established the publishing house, opening bookstores and second-hand bookshops in BeyazÄ±t Square, near the current university's Faculty of Letters and Faculty of Chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These establishments became among the most well-known and beloved bookshops in Istanbul, operating for many years until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Impact on Education

The events of 1915 also impacted education, as all [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools in Istanbul]] were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The speaker's grandmother, who was in middle school at the time, had to attend a school opened by French Jews for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This experience led to her proficiency in French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Although [[impact_of_the_deportation_on_education_and_armenian_schools_in_istanbul | Armenian schools reopened]] in 1918, the grandmother was married off in the interim period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

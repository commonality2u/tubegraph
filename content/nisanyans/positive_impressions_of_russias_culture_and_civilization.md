During a recent visit to [[cultural_experiences_in_moscow | Moscow]] and Montenegro, the speaker shared "very positive impressions" of [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]], finding it a "livable country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> and even "more livable country than [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western Europe]] at the point we have reached today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Intellectual Engagement

In cities like [[cultural_experiences_in_moscow | Moscow]], Saratov, and Petersburg, people demonstrated loyalty and seriousness when listening to "market chats." They remembered, argued, and engaged deeply with the content, including "people who owned big businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This contrasts with YouTube comments, which are often at the level of "boys between the ages of 12 and 15" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Rational and logical people in [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] value market chats, listen seriously, and can express opposing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Preservation of Culture and Civilization

The speaker observed a "total collapse of culture and civilization" in the [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western world]], a process believed to have started in the early 20th century but reaching a "terrifying level" in the last 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This includes "social dysfunction" in culture, science, and art, which are crucial for holding a society together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Societies in the West seem to have forgotten their reason for existence and even "come to hate" questions about living better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

In contrast, the speaker felt "a small glimmer of hope is still burning in [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It is suggested that [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] could be the country that will "save [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western civilization]]" or "produce a new green sprout from the cut trunk of [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western civilization]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### The Ilya Glazunov Museum Experience

A visit to the Ilya Glazunov Museum highlighted this cultural difference. Glazunov, a prominent Russian painter from the 1970s to 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, was a "first-class painter" who worked in the classical tradition, taking his art seriously and recognizing its social function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Historically, the function of art in high arts has been to "answer the question of who we are, and... why we are so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. However, [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western Europe]] suffered a "rupture" after World War I, leading to a loss of faith in itself and its institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This resulted in modernist art movements that aimed to "break the authority structures," mocking and belittling societal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. After 1945, modern art became "an investment area for some rich people who were filled with a sense of hatred towards culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, with "buffoonery" presented as art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

[[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]], during the Soviet period, "entered a kind of time tunnel" for 70-80 years, largely preserving its classical art understanding by trying to combine it with a political program, though not always productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. As a result, it "did not experience the moral collapse that the [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Western world]] experienced in the 20th century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] now appears to be in an "awakening" process, potentially representing a "new modernism that takes its roots from the past," unlike the West which has seen "nothing disgraceful" emerge from its art since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Inclusive Civilization

Historically, [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] has been an "inclusive civilization," integrating diverse nations who adopted Russian ideals and culture without compromising their identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. This is evident in all levels of Russian political and cultural life, where various nations from [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] and the former Soviet Union have a significant share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. For example, the Sheremetyevo family, which gave its name to the airport, was of Tatar origin and became influential during Catherine the Great's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. Similarly, the Saltykov family, from which later Russian tsars descended, also has Turkish origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>.

Unlike the United States, where national identities are often cultural hobbies for immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>, in [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]], each national identity has a geographical basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>. Despite this, [[russias_historical_and_cultural_context | Russia]] has successfully incorporated diverse tribes into its political and cultural environment, leading to a significant proportion of important figures in Russian history being of non-Slavic origins, including Turkish, Armenian, Caucasian, Ukrainian, Polish, and Jewish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>. These individuals have dedicated themselves to the Russian state and civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>.

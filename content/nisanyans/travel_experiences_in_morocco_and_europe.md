The speaker recounts a three-week journey that began in [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]] before extending to Europe, detailing the highlights and challenges encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Morocco: A Magnificent Journey
The trip started in [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]] and was described as "magnificent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It involved a "back-to-back" series of travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Initial Preparations and Group Tour
The speaker and Fırat, the website manager, undertook preliminary preparations for a group trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Subsequently, 38 friends joined for an organized tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> around [[cultural_and_architectural_influences_in_marrakech | Marrakesh]] in the southern part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Independent Exploration
After the group departed, the speaker and two friends continued their journey to explore the northern part of [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]], reaching Tangier, near the Gibraltar Strait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### General Impressions of Morocco
[[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]] was found to be a "beautiful country, a very beautiful country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is characterized as "docile," "humane," and "civilized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, a significant drawback noted was the excessive number of tourists, with the speaker expressing a dislike for "seeing European crowds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

#### Modernity and Cleanliness
A discussion arose regarding whether [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Morocco]] or [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Turkey]] is more modern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The modern parts of Moroccan cities are described as "extremely Europe" and very clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Even the intricate old neighborhoods were found to be clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]] was observed to be cleaner than [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Turkey]], Egypt, and Iran, suggesting efficient municipal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Rabat was particularly striking for its green, orderly, and contemporary appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, offering all the conveniences and commercial services of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

#### Preservation of Historical Culture
Unlike [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Turkey]], [[modernity_and_preservation_of_historical_culture_in_morocco | Morocco]] has preserved its old cities "in all their details," with no noticeable modern structures incongruous with the historical style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. In southern rural areas, villages continue a centuries-old lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

#### French Influence
The 40-50 years of French rule have significantly impacted [[historical_and_cultural_connections_between_morocco_and_the_ottoman_empire | Morocco]], with French being widely spoken and used for signs and official offices, often even over Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This indicates that colonial traces persist as a "European polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, while traditional social order aspects are also preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

#### Loyalty to the King
A slogan observed on branches, "Allah el Vatan El Malik" (Allah, the Homeland, and the King), mirrors Turkish nationalistic slogans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The speaker noted a strong affection for the King, with photographs displayed everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Older and more conservative people expressed no negative opinions about the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. An interesting parallel was drawn between fanatical Kemalists in [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Turkey]] and fanatical supporters of the King in [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Morocco]], particularly among secular, middle-class women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Highlights of the Morocco Trip

#### The Sahara Desert
The "biggest highlight" was a one-night stay in a camp in the Sahara Desert, near the Mauritania border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Access required a two-hour jeep ride followed by a camel ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. It was an "unforgettable experience," described as giving "goosebumps," feeling like a "special" and "beautiful thing" to be experienced barefoot on the fine sand hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

#### Djemaa el-Fna Square in Marrakesh
The second highlight was Djemaa el-Fna, a square in [[cultural_and_architectural_influences_in_marrakech | Marrakesh]], considered "one of the most unique places in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. It is shapeless, lacks conventional beauty, but is "insanely crowded and insanely active 24 hours a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
Activities include:
*   **Daytime:** Storytellers, snake charmers, fortune tellers, beggars, henna artists, and fruit juice vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Evening:** Food stands open, creating a "racket" with cheap, delicious, and fresh food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Barbary musicians with drums create a "strange music" that makes one "drunk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

While initially enjoyable, managing a group of 40 people in this chaos became tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

#### The Fez Bazaar
The third highlight was the Fez Bazaar, described as another "unique place in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Unlike [[cultural_and_architectural_influences_in_marrakech | Marrakesh]], Fez is less touristic and larger; the Marrakesh Bazaar is likened to Istanbul in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The city has never lost its historical character, with breathtaking beauty at every step, including intricate doors, courtyards, palaces, and madrasahs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. It's evident that it was once a "very civilized place," on par with 16th-century Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

A striking feature is the active presence of manufacturing tradesmen, giving the impression of being in the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_of_societal_developments_in_morocco_and_turkey | Turkey]], where crafts are "dead," Fez maintains artisan traditions with incredible work in areas like carpentry, tiling, lamp making, and leatherworking, producing high-quality handicrafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. However, the average age of craftsmen is over 50, suggesting that this tradition might decline in 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

#### Claudio Bravo's Palace in Taroudant
The fourth highlight was Claudio Bravo's Palace in Taroudant, a provincial town in southern [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Claudio Bravo was a Chilean artist and a "main name of 20th-century anti-modernism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, known for painting portraits of figures like Francisco Franco and Ferdinand Marcos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. He built this palace in the desert with his wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The speaker noted that Bravo had "unlimited money" and a "serious understanding of art" with a "classical and disciplined" approach, unlike modern art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. It was a pleasure to see a palace that combined Western, Moroccan, Eastern, and Islamic arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

Upon his death, Bravo, having no heirs, left the palace to his driver, Beşir Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. The speaker predicts that the palace will deteriorate in 5-10 years due to the new owner's lack of equipping to manage such a property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, potentially turning into a purely profit-driven hotel or neglected by the Ministry of Tourism and Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

> [!INFO] Sustaining a Palace:
> The speaker reflects that sustaining a palace across generations requires two conditions:
> 1.  **Solid long-term income source:** Modern income sources are volatile; only agricultural income from land is truly permanent across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
> 2.  **Many children:** To increase the chance that at least one heir will be capable and willing to continue the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
>
> Without these conditions, creating a "great beauty" in the modern world is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

## Europe: Unexpected Detours and Challenges
After [[travel_experiences_in_morocco | Morocco]], the speaker and friends planned to travel to [[travel_and_food_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] via Malaga, Spain, due to a cheap flight ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### The Incident in Spain
While in Spain, they decided to visit the Alhambra Palace in Granada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The entrance area was "insanely crowded," making it impossible to get a ticket for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. During this time, their passports and "2000 dollars" (the income from the journey) were stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

This left them "stuck in the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. They traveled to Madrid to seek help from the Greek and Armenian consulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Both consulates provided travel papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, these papers restricted their travel: the speaker could only go to Armenia, and their wife could only go to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The speaker and their wife separated at the airport, with the wife boarding a flight to Athens and the speaker awaiting a midnight flight to Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This series of events led to extreme tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, leaving them feeling they would "have to lie on our backs for a week or so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The speaker notes that they will obtain a new passport in Yerevan and then return to [[travel_and_food_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>, while their wife is expected to remain in Greece for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. The initial plan to travel to [[travel_and_food_experiences_in_montenegro | Montenegro]] was motivated by an "extremely cheap ticket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

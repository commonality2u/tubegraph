The idea of transforming the Sunday chat programs into a book for the Jewish language was initially proposed by a publisher and publishing house, a concept that had not occurred to the speaker until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Scope of the Project
The "Sunday chats" podcast has been running for 180 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, specifically 184 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Each episode is typically more than an hour long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This means the speaker has accumulated approximately 200-220 hours of content, within which a few meaningful words were spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## The Editing Process
An intensive process has begun to compile these programs into a [[sunday_chat_compilation_book | book]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The content is being corrected and collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This includes addressing instances where "reactionism is spoken openly" or "absurd words" were used, or where "the bridges of logic" were not correctly built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The speaker also aims to remove filler words like "this" and "that," which are recognized as bad habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

The resulting [[sunday_chat_compilation_book | book]] will be released in "several volumes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

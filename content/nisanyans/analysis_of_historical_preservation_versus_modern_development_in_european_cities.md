European cities are recognized for their historical beauty, meticulously preserved to retain their past charm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. Cities like Venice, Prague, Vienna, and old towns in France, Belgium, Holland, and Spain are cited as examples of stunning historical architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. These cities are often described as being "preserved in amber and beeswax," akin to museums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

## Modern Development and its Impact

Despite the success in preserving historical cores, there's a critical view of modern development in European cities. It is asserted that "nothing beautiful has been done in European cities anymore" since the early 20th century, specifically after 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. New constructions are often described as an "ugly" and "cancerous" modern shell built around the poetic beauty of historical neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

## Commercialization of Historical Centers

The preservation of these historical sites, particularly since the 1980s, is largely driven by a "profit purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. This commercialization transforms historical centers into "shopping malls and tourist shows," characterized by "all the same shops, boutiques, souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes, bars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. This focus on tourism leads to a "temple of hypocrisy" where the historical areas are primarily maintained for visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

## Residential Displacement

A consequence of this commercialization is that local residents often no longer inhabit these historical centers. Instead, the historical areas are populated by university students, the poor, or immigrants, while locals tend to move to the "most ugly and dead neighborhoods" outside the preserved historical core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

## Notable Preserved Cities

Despite these criticisms, the successful preservation of old European cities like Cambridge, Prague, Trebon, Warsaw's central district, and numerous old French cities is acknowledged for their "mind-blowing beauties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. However, even these are ultimately viewed as "fake" and resembling "museums" rather than living urban spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

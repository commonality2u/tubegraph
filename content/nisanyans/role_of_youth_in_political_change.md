The role of youth in political change is highlighted as a critical dynamic, particularly in the context of contemporary [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]]. The despair and rebellion of young people are presented as a natural response to a perceived stolen future and systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Youth Sentiment and the Call for Rebellion

A message from a long-time follower named Berkin articulates the sentiment of young people regarding the Ekrem İmamoğlu incident:
> "Dear teacher, I am sure that you will talk about the Ekrem İmamoğlu incident today. While doing this, please do not forget the hearts of us young people waiting in the cold on the streets. Please do not forget me and the young people in their 20s who are suffering from heartache and sadness right now. Put aside the CHP and its mistakes for a moment. Don't forget that on one side there are young people, and on the other side there is a monster in human clothing, a raving, foaming dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

This message underscores the emotional burden and sadness felt by the youth in their twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The speaker agrees with Berkin, affirming that he has no intention of forgetting the plight of the youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Justification for Rebellion

Rebelling against tyranny is described as not just a right, but something that "adds meaning and polarity to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. It is considered legitimate to use violence against tyranny and rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Those who advocate for peaceful means are seen as siding with authority and the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Root Causes of Youth Despair

The current situation is not merely a [[political_changes_in_turkey | political crisis]] but a "great social crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, manifesting in several [[challenges_of_modern_youth_in_the_21st_century | challenges of modern youth in the 21st century]]:
*   **Stolen Future:** The hopes and future of the youth have been taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Education:** Schools are perceived as inadequate ("garbage") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Opportunity:** Young people have no expectations for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, lacking the basic right to hope for owning a house, getting married, or starting a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Drug Addiction:** This has become a widespread disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

These factors lead young people to declare "enough is enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Uprisings and the Nature of Political Change

The Ekrem İmamoğlu incident is viewed as a "drop in the bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, similar to the Gezi Park events 12 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### Short-term Limitations of Street Protests
While uprisings are considered natural and supported, short-term results are not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Governments typically do not change through slogans or street demonstrations alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Change requires the "force of arms" and an organized, armed force to pose a credible threat to the existing power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

Street demonstrations can, however, serve as a justification or excuse for a coup prepared elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, as seen in Ukraine in 2014 and Syria in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Historically, changes of government are matters of "actual power" and "balance of arms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### Long-term Impact of Youth Rebellion
Despite the short-term limitations, the current uprising and rebellion are not meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. They are expected to have significant effects in the long term, potentially influencing decisions related to the use of arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The speaker expresses full support for those rebelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Challenges to Political Change in Turkey
The speaker argues that in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], democracy, particularly the multi-party parliamentary regime, effectively ended in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, or perhaps even in December 2013 with 2016 being the definitive closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. It is believed that elections will not lead to a change in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, primarily due to:
*   **Dictator's View of Opposition:** The current leader explicitly considers any demand for government change as treason and an illegitimate pursuit of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Arbitration Institutions:** There is no state-level mechanism or independent body (e.g., Parliament, Constitutional Court, Supreme Electoral Council, or [[military_discipline_and_political_involvement | armed forces]]) capable of enforcing an election loss and removing the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Retribution:** The current government and its affiliates have committed actions that formally constitute crimes, meaning they have no guarantee of safety or freedom if they lose power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

Therefore, the current leader is not expected to leave power unless through death or significant bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. The only alternatives presented are waiting for the leader's death or supporting a cadre within the current state powers willing to take responsibility for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

## Youth in the New Political Landscape

The world is entering a new era where the multi-party parliamentary regime, a standard since 1945, has lost its function, legitimacy, and credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. Key branches of public administration, including security, intelligence, and money management, have moved beyond parliamentary control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>. Foreign states and institutions, via organizations like USAID, have extensively infiltrated and financed civil society organizations globally, making "civil society" effectively an extension of external powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. This means the "real event" is happening in the background, out of the control of democratic parliamentary regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.

### The Emerging Political Powers
Two main political powers are forming globally, especially in the Western world, including Europe and America, which also influence [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>:
1.  **The Oligarchy:** A powerful bureaucratic network, often comprised of graduates from Western universities who see themselves as technocrats and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. They have an ideological solidarity but have lost the ability to comprehend the world and dialog with it, attempting to solve all problems with algorithms and bureaucratic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. This utopia is collapsing as they fail to manage effectively, becoming overly complicated and detached from common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. This oligarchy is increasingly exhibiting a "fascism" that encroaches on traditional areas of freedom, using pretexts like the Covid incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Populist Leaders:** These leaders combat the oligarchic dictatorship through popular support, appealing to less-educated segments of society, the working class, and rural populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>. Examples include Trump in America and Victor Orban in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. However, their chances of success are seen as weak, especially in appealing to younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>, and they lack the capacity to support radical policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.

### The Furious Youth as a Third Force
The most crucial social phenomenon, determining the future of Western societies, including [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], is neither the bureaucratic oligarchy nor the populists, but the "furious youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. This "hopeless and desperate youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a> is not aligned with either existing political faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. They are described as "probably the most dangerous being on earth and in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>, and the extent of their future actions and violence is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Future Outlook

The current situation is likened to the period leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917, where an explosion seemed unthinkable just weeks before it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:00]</a>. This suggests that a major explosion is imminent in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>, explaining the irrational behavior of ruling cadres who are acting out of fear of losing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

The regime in [[social_and_political_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is compared to the last years of Abdulhamid's dictatorial regime (1895-1908), which also became weary, tired, sullen, and isolated after initially pursuing reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>. This regime, too, eventually fell, not through street demonstrations but through military conspiracy and two military coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>. The government's recent "rampage" is attributed to its conclusion that preserving democratic appearances is no longer useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:38:00">[45:38:00]</a>.

While a Gezi Park-like uprising may occur, it is expected to lose momentum within a week or two without an organized and armed structure to carry it to the next stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>. Without such a structure, protests lead only to arrests and prolonged consequences for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>.

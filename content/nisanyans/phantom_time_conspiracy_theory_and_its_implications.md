The Phantom Time Conspiracy Theory is a thesis proposed by a German academic, whom the speaker refers to as a "charlatan professor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The speaker had read about this theory years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Core Claims of the Theory

The theory asserts that the history of Medieval Europe is based on a significant fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. This deliberate lie, created around the year 1000 by German Emperor Otto III <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>, involved rewriting historical records and books to add approximately 360 years to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. Specifically, the period from the beginning of 600 AD to 900 AD is claimed to be a fabricated gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>, meaning history is much shorter and the year 900 AD followed shortly after the fall of the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. As a result, figures like Charlemagne and the entire Carolingian dynasty, who are said to have lived in France, are dismissed as fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.

## Refutations and Criticisms

The speaker dismisses the theory as "breathtakingly eccentric" and "nonsense," stating there is "not even a doubt" that it is untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Several proofs contradict the theory:

*   **Ignorance of Non-European History:** The German academic appears "completely unaware of non-European history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. The theory implies that the entire history of Islam, including the Umayyad and Abbasid Empires, and the Tang Dynasty in China – one of the brightest periods of Chinese history – also occurred during this "phantom period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. The interactions and connections between these three civilizations (Europe, Islam, and China), such as the Battle of Talas in 750 AD, are well-recorded in both Chinese and Arab sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. For the theory to be true, it would require a systematic campaign of lies involving not just Europeans, but also Islamic and Chinese historians, which would mean living in "a very strange fantasy world" where "we can no longer know anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Calendar Discrepancies:** The theory points to a 1500s calendar reform where 11 days were removed to align the Roman calendar with astronomical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. The professor claims it should have been 14 days, attributing the 3-day difference to the insertion of 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. However, ancient Roman and medieval records of solar eclipses and comets show an error-free historical trend, providing a "doomed explanation and solution" to the professor's claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

In conclusion, the speaker asserts that the [[Conspiracy Theories and Authority | Phantom Time Conspiracy Theory]] is an "original and false thesis of a charlatan professor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

## Implications for Historical Understanding

The speaker notes that "charlatan history professors" will always exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. However, such questions are valuable as they keep one's "questioning capacity awake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a> and stimulate the thought process of how to prove what one believes to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

The speaker advises that when researching history, one should:
*   **Assume dishonesty:** Begin by assuming that any historian, especially local ones, might be lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   **Verify claims:** Test every statement and claim made by checking with "other sources" and seeking out sources with "opposing ideas or opposing viewpoints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Maintain skepticism:** Always approach historical propositions with a question mark regarding their certainty, aiming for "converging 9s" of real information rather than 100% solidity, except in closed systems like mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.
*   **Language proficiency:** It is "very difficult" to overcome historical lies if one only knows Turkish; knowing multiple foreign languages, especially English, French, German, or Russian, is crucial for effective questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   **Defend knowledge:** When challenged, one should be able to defend their knowledge with "solid justifications" that would convince "an objective person and an impartial referee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>.

The speaker critiques the Turkish approach to history writing, stating that many "History Professor or Associate Professor" individuals in Turkey "lie" and are "immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. They fabricate history by choosing stories suitable for a discourse of "homeland, nation, race, and Central Asian discourse," repeating them until the origin of the lie is obscured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

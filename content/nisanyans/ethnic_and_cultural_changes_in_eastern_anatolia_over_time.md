This article explores the [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics of ethnic groups in Turkey]], particularly focusing on Eastern Anatolia, and the [[cultural_and_political_transformations_in_turkey_and_its_periphery | cultural and political transformations]] that have shaped the region's demographic landscape over time. It draws insights from extensive field research conducted for the book "Turkey East of Ankara" [00:01:05].

## The Book "Turkey East of Ankara"

Published in 2006, the book "Turkey East of Ankara" is described as a travelogue exploring the [[historical_settlement_structures_in_eastern_anatolia | oldest settlement structures of Eastern Anatolia]] [00:00:00]. It was written over six years with the aim of discussing an "extraordinarily troublesome subject like Eastern Türkiye" without causing too much disturbance or fear [00:01:05].

The book is bilingual, with one side in Turkish and the other in English [00:00:29]. However, the Turkish and English versions are not identical; they are approached as "two different books with two different approaches" [00:00:36]. This distinction is deliberate, as the author states, "you are talking to two different groups of people," and their "prejudices are different" [00:01:33].

The research for the book involved frequent trips to the East over a six-year period, covering numerous places including Ağrı, Ardahan, all villages of Hakkari, all districts of Bitlis, Hizan, Dersim, and the northern parts of Van [00:02:14]. The author spoke with many people, including villagers, cultured individuals, gendarmerie commanders, and police station commanders, aiming to understand and learn with an open mind [00:02:43].

## Historical Ethnic Structure in Eastern Anatolia (Pre-20th Century)

During the research, a clear pattern was observed regarding the ethnic and cultural structure of the country in the past [00:02:09].

*   **Dominance of Turkish-speaking Elites:** Until the beginning of the 20th century, all major cities in Eastern Anatolia, such as Van and Diyarbakır, were primarily Turkish-speaking [00:03:20]. For instance, in the 1910s, there was "no trace of Kurds" in the center of Van [00:03:31]. Similarly, in Diyarbakır, Turkish was spoken, and all major families were Turkish [00:03:36].
*   **The Ottoman Ruling Class:** This model was common throughout the Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans [00:03:42]. The Ottoman ruling class was cosmopolitan and of diverse origins; individuals whose mothers might be Albanian, or whose great-grandfathers came from Dagestan or Georgia, would become "Turk" [00:04:30]. This transformation occurred as they migrated to cities, gained education, and integrated into the state mechanism, adopting Turkish language and society [00:04:04].
*   **Non-Muslim Populations:** Non-Muslims largely undertook the urban services of society [00:05:19].
    *   In the city of Van at the beginning of the 20th century, about half of the population was Turkish, with a significant Armenian population [00:05:21].
    *   In Diyarbakır, more than half of the population was governed by Turks, alongside a 20-30% Armenian population and Assyrians [00:05:30].
    *   Mardin was predominantly Christian, with Arabic as the city's language [00:05:44]. While ruling families considered themselves Turks, almost all Turkish families in Mardin had Armenian ancestry, indicating deep intermingling [00:06:05].
*   **Kurdish Presence:** While Kurds were present in the region in significant numbers, their social power and opportunities were largely confined to rural areas [00:10:12]. Some Kurdish families, like the sons of Şeref Han, became part of the empire's ruling class, assimilating into the broader Ottoman structure [00:06:25].

## Impact of Population Shifts and Republican Era Changes

The elimination of the Armenian population from the region had an "unexpected result for the Turks," effectively causing them to "shoot themselves in the foot" [00:06:47]. Cities like Van, Diyarbakır, Bitlis, and Mardin became "uninhabitable" as essential services, such as dentists, tailors, and insurance companies, disappeared [00:06:52]. The group that provided a "cosmopolitan culture and economic infrastructure" to these cities vanished [00:07:14].

During the Republican period, the Turkish-speaking elite classes in these cities began to shrink [00:07:27]. Their children were sent to study in Ankara and Istanbul, but rarely returned to their hometowns [00:07:31]. As a result, these cities gradually collapsed and decayed until the 1960s, a period described as the "Stone Age" or "Middle Ages" for the region [00:07:50].

### The Kurdishization of Eastern Anatolia

A significant shift occurred with the economic development and a "huge migration from the villages to the cities" in the 1960s [00:08:05]. This led to a gradual "Turkification" of all cities in the region [00:08:14].

However, the most profound [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | social and sociological changes]] in Eastern Anatolia during the Republican regime have been the "complete Kurdishization of this region" [00:10:08]. While Kurds were historically a significant element, they were largely confined to rural areas [00:10:12]. Today, they form an "almost homogeneous" population in their own region, dominating major cities:
*   Mardin: In the 1970s and 80s, the city center had "no trace of Kurds," who were primarily in rural areas [00:08:21]. However, a "wall" preventing Kurdish migration into Mardin eventually collapsed, and today Kurds are the numerical majority in the city center [00:09:23].
*   Kızıltepe: When Kurdish migration into Mardin was initially prevented, Kızıltepe, a city 20 kilometers away, swelled and became a larger settlement, recognized as a "Kurdish city" [00:09:00].
*   Diyarbakır: Currently, Diyarbakır is 80-90%, if not close to 100%, Kurdish [00:09:34].
*   Van: Kurds are "by far the majority" [00:09:41].

### Future Implications of Ethnic Shifts

The speaker argues that the complete Kurdishization of Eastern Anatolia has created "social demands that are impossible to prevent" [00:10:39]. While Turkish remains an official language, the speaker believes that Kurdish will inevitably become dominant in schools, streets, government offices, and broadcasting in the region [00:10:48]. It is seen as impossible to suppress a language spoken with pride by the "overwhelming majority of the population" in a region with nearly 20 million people [00:11:12].

The current reality is that everyone living in Eastern Anatolia, including Turks, "has to learn Kurdish" [00:11:40]. Delaying this recognition is deemed futile and will only lead to greater problems and an "explosion" [00:11:56]. The region now hosts a "homogeneous population of 20 million" that is 87-90% dominant in its own region, with its own language and "organic intellectuals" who want to express a national ideology [00:12:07]. Trying to contain them as merely an "element at home" is seen as impossible in the modern world [00:12:31].

The speaker also touches upon the broader [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | political and social implications]] of these demographic shifts, including the unlikelihood of an independent Kurdish state due to international conjuncture and vast military power differences with Turkey [00:13:00]. However, certain states, such as Russia and Syria, would benefit from Turkey's control weakening in the region, particularly if a Kurdistan were to emerge closer to Russia [00:14:36]. This long-term strategic view considers Turkey as a potential threat to Russia in a possible future conflict [00:14:53].

The concept of an "intellectual" is described as a social class, specifically a product of a certain age, period, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>. The speaker asserts that, in the present day, "there is no such thing" as an intellectual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>.

## Historical Period of Intellectuals

In Europe, the era of intellectuals is identified as beginning around 1720-1740 and concluding around 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>. In Türkiye, this period started with the Tanzimat reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>, specifically with Namık Kemal and the Young Ottomans in the 1860s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>. The speaker suggests that this era largely ended around 2000 in Türkiye, with Ahmet Altan being the last prominent example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>. Before this period, during the time of Suleiman the Magnificent or in the Middle Ages, the concept or class of an intellectual did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>.

## Characteristics and Role

Intellectuals, though lacking official authority, wielded significant influence on society purely through the power of their thought and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. They were theoretically expected to rise above individual and class interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>, analyzing social events through a universally claimed method of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>. A key characteristic was their consistent critical stance, refusing to submit to existing power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.

### Relationship with Authority

This "spiritual class" or "brahman class" (using Indian terminology) often found itself in conflict with authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>. While some European societies managed to find a "modus vivendi" with intellectuals, allowing them to criticize because their input was valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>, this represented the peak of intellectual history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

### Decline of Intellectuals

The decline began as states developed more subtle methods to neutralize intellectuals, such as:
*   Silencing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>
*   Buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>
*   Marginalizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>
*   Transforming them into "entertainment commodities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>

Less skillful states resorted to imprisonment, execution, or other forceful means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:35">[01:34:35]</a>. The speaker contends that there are no longer intellectuals in the traditional sense, even if many people are oppressed and imprisoned in Türkiye today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>. These individuals, such as Osman Kavala or Selahattin Demirtaş, are not seen as societal guides or moral leaders in the same way historical figures like Nazım Hikmet were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. Ahmet Altan is presented as "the last last last example" who was also silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.

> [!question] The speaker's reflections raise questions about the contemporary relevance of the term "intellectual":
> *   Is the quality of intellectuals measured by time spent in prison? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>
> *   Should the sincerity of a writer who has not been imprisoned for a thought crime be doubted? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>
> *   Can one criticize the system without going to prison? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>

The speaker concludes that the "book is closed" on the age of intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>.

The art of painting is said to have "died" in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>. This phenomenon is attributed to the period of significant spiritual chaos that followed World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.

## Post-World War I Societal Shift
By 1918, respected segments of society experienced a profound loss of standing, being defeated and subsequently cursed and rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>. Across the [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western world]] and in affected Asian and North African countries, people began to question and reject traditional values, elevating mockery to a high art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>. This was initially viewed as a healthy reaction, necessary to discard outdated aspects and "shake" a stagnant [[western_cultural_and_societal_transformations | Western civilization]] that had gone astray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

## Modern Art Movement (1918-1930s)
Modern art created between 1918 and the 1930s functioned as a crucial "cleaning operation" against the rigid traditional structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>. It aimed to open a blocked channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. However, this period did not yield anything truly permanent or valuable that would endure for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48">[01:30:48]</a>. During this time, artists with serious art education actively sought to dismantle the existing artistic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

## Usurpation and Decline
Unfortunately, the modern art movement did not evolve into a new synthesis. Instead, it was "usurped" by wealthy art collectors, predominantly Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. This takeover fostered an understanding where art's value was determined by its shock, absurdity, or destructiveness, making it more beautiful, expensive, and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.

Peggy Guggenheim, an American patron, significantly contributed to this transformation by purchasing avant-garde works from artists in Paris, Berlin, Venice, and Milan at "absurd prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>. This action turned art into both an investment tool and a means of achieving social prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.

The [[understanding_art_and_cultures_role_in_society | Western understanding of art]] never recovered from this shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>. After 1945, there is considered to have been "nothingness" in art, with no significant works produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>.

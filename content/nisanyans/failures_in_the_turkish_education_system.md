The assertion that the people of Turkey are "mostly uncouth and peasants" is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As of today, the peasant population in Turkey has fallen below 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and the majority of people are not peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. On the contrary, Turks are generally well-mannered by world standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Issues with adapting to city culture exist in newly urbanized areas, but the real fault is not with people from village roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead, the problem lies with the [[cultural_and_moral_decay_of_the_elite_class_in_Turkey | moral and cultural decay of the elite class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, especially the "nouveau riche" middle class, who are described as "extremely uncouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The fundamental issue for Turkey is not peasantry or uncouthness, but the poor education of the [[role_of_educated_classes_in_Turkey | educated classes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Republic's Educational Shortcomings

The greatest failure of the Republic of Turkey in the field of education is its inability to establish a proper elite education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While the Republic succeeded in providing minimum level education to large masses, particularly after 1950, by opening primary schools in every village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a society requires more than just widespread minimum education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is insufficient to merely train civil servants one level above that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

A crucial need is to raise an elite group that can lead society and form its intellectual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, in Turkey, the only opportunities for such education until recently were a few elite schools established during the Ottoman period, mostly by foreign states, such as Robert College, Saint Joseph, Galatasaray High School, and German High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The Republic did not allow these institutions to develop or increase in number; instead, they became smaller, their budgets narrowed, and their scope became limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Consequently, the number and quality of seriously educated, world-class individuals in Turkey have gradually decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Achieving this level of education often requires a lucky minority who find opportunities to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Those educated abroad often become alienated from the society they are meant to serve and struggle to adapt to local conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This phenomenon results from the absence of high-quality education organically integrated into the country's [[educational_system_and_values_in_trkiye | education system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The domestic [[educational_system_and_values_in_trkiye | education system]] in Turkey is characterized as a "stupid brainwashing program" that primarily teaches how to be a civil servant and "bow down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. As a result, Turkey has failed to create a modern elite class capable of guiding the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## The Public's Unmet Hunger for Knowledge

Despite these educational shortcomings, the [[publics_hunger_for_knowledge_and_education_in_Turkey | people of Turkey are in search of wise and cultured individuals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The Anatolian people's love and respect for scholars are described as "endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. They show great respect for knowledge, listening attentively to those they perceive as teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

However, if the westernized, few in number, and limited in quality elite cannot provide this service and respond to the public's need for knowledge, people turn to religious figures like "Hoca" (teacher) and "Hacı" (pilgrim) for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A significant problem is that proper education for these religious figures has also been prevented, leading to a decline in the quality of Islamic religious experts compared to the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This decline is attributed to the prevailing [[educational_system_and_values_in_trkiye | education system]], not the fault of the individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The public demonstrates a "tremendous thirst for knowledge" on basic issues, especially religious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. They listen with enthusiasm to discussions on various subjects, including the universe, existence, Turkish history and social structure, the Armenian Genocide, the [[political_and_social_issues_in_Turkey | Kurdish issue]], the Syrian issue, and questions about Atatürk's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This indicates a significant [[publics_hunger_for_knowledge_and_education_in_Turkey | hunger for knowledge in Turkey]] that remains largely unsatisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Problem of the "Half-Educated" Elite

A particular concern is the "ignorance and moral degradation of the half-educated Turks," referring to those who perceive themselves as "white-collar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This segment, estimated at one to two million people, lacks social responsibility and any instinct to teach or give back to others; their focus is solely on self-gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. They are considered a "scourge of Türkiye morally and culturally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This situation is attributed to the way they are educated, as there is no education system in Turkey that makes guiding people a mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Above this group, there is a staff of approximately 50,000 "real elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. These individuals are terribly alienated from Turkish society and harbor no vision or hope other than leaving Turkey as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If they cannot leave themselves, they attempt to send their children abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This constitutes a "great tragedy" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

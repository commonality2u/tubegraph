From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The speaker recounts numerous instances of being subjected to "lynching campaigns" in Turkey throughout his career, often becoming "the most hated object of our beautiful Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. He notes he has been subjected to such national-scale campaigns at least ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He attributes this "privilege" to being "born in the wrong country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Over time, he has become accustomed to these events, viewing them as routine and ultimately harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Documented Instances of Lynching Campaigns

    *   Comments about "Natashas" (prostitutes from former Soviet republics) filling hotels in Trabzon and Rize, suggesting they were "completely harmless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> and their profession "doesn't harm anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   The speaker clarifies that his comments contained irony and a "distant view," intending to tickle subjects others take seriously, which often "drives people crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He notes that none of his controversial statements were inherently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

*   **Şirince Constructions Hate Campaign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
    *   This campaign arose from constructions he made in Şirince.

    *   In 2009, he faced a campaign for asking about the limits of freedom of speech regarding Allah and the prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   In 2012, he was "lynched" for statements concerning the historical personality of Prophet Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   He asserts he never insulted Allah or the prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> and that these campaigns aim to restrict freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

*   **Psychologist-Client Sexual Intimacy Incident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
    *   He asked if the consequences of the lynching against a man involved in a sexual relationship with his client were "morally defensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   He notes that the majority of the public, lacking "subtleties," sided with the lynching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

*   **Elazığ Earthquake Comments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    *   He was lynched for questioning why people would pray for others to die but then feel bad when they actually die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   His question was about whether it was acceptable to approve of a city's population (seen as "fascist and bigoted") dying in an earthquake, but he stated he only cared for the innocent children who might be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. He views this as the "morally correct approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

*   **Atatürk-Related Comments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>
    *   The speaker addressed widespread gossip about Atatürk's relationship with his adopted daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. He asked whether it was "right for an adolescent to adopt a girl and keep them in his private apartment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, calling the creation of such gossip a "disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
    *   He also discussed Abdurrahim, an orphaned child Atatürk took in, whose story was a "taboo" until recent years, brought up as a defense mechanism against the "daughters" gossip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. He questioned why Abdurrahim was sent away when Atatürk married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
    *   He argued against the idea that Atatürk's private life should not be discussed due to his achievements, stating the "event itself is wrong" regardless of physical contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Criticism of Leadership

The speaker discusses various aspects of [[public_perception_and_media_influence_on_Turkeys_political_landscape | public perception]] and political figures:

*   **Critique of Kemalism**: The speaker asserts that the problem is not with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk himself, but with his "disciples" and the "icon" of Kemalism, which he describes as "contemporary Turkish racism and the state worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. He calls Kemalism a "moral blindness" that justifies "all kinds of dishonesty" in the name of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. He argues that Kemalism is a "semi-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a> and is incapable of understanding groups like the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. He believes that "unless we get rid of the Kemalism disease," there will be no "civilization in Türkiye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

*   **Nazım Hikmet's View of Atatürk**: He cites Nazım Hikmet's poem about "Tahsim Bey" as the most accurate description of Atatürk, portraying him as an "extraordinarily strong personality" who reduced everyone around him to nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. He characterizes Atatürk as a "victorious and magnificent Gambler," "sarcastic, belligerent, cunning and dominating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. He lists many close associates and family members Atatürk "betrayed," suggesting this is a personality trait akin to sociopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

*   **Hrant Dink's Murder and Samast's Release**: The speaker criticizes the public's reaction to the release of Ogun Samast, who served 17 years for the murder of Hrant Dink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. He views prisons as "the cruelest torture institution ever invented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. He states that the real perpetrators behind the murder are known but have not been held accountable, calling Samast a "pawn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. He accuses those who direct public hatred towards Samast of deliberately diverting the target from the true "will" behind the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

*   **Turkish Racism and the [[political_and_social_issues_in_turkey | Kurdish Issue]]**: He describes a pervasive "immoral racism in the Turks," arguing that assimilation policies against the Kurds have "failed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. He believes [[social_dynamics_and_politics_in_turkey | Turkish society]] has not yet grasped this defeat and that the Kurdish side's "victory" will involve integration into the system and taking it over from the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>.

## Broader Socio-Political Analysis

The speaker also delves into broader [[current_political_landscape_in_turkey | political dynamics]] and societal issues:

*   **Ottoman Modernization and Western Influence**: He discusses the Ottoman Empire's Tanzimat period, where educated classes "unanimously accepted the moral superiority of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This superiority was seen in areas like honesty, education, respect for women, clean cities, and advancements in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Women's rights, particularly girls' education, became a burning issue and a key dimension of modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

*   **Power and Human Psychology**: He observes that the desire for social and sexual power often go hand-in-hand in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Unlimited power leads men to "push the limits" and pursue "harems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. He contrasts this with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, noting that despite 21 years at the top of power, he has not heard of any "mischief," finding this "a very interesting thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

*   **Religion Without God**: He questions whether religion requires a god to spread in society or invisible threats for people to follow rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. He sees religion as a serious social need, but believes the traditional concept of an omnipotent God is no longer defensible for the "wise part of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.

*   **Germany's Geopolitical Stance**: He claims Germany has "lost its mind" by becoming overly subservient to the United States, especially regarding the Ukraine and Gaza wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. He points to the collapse of German industry and the Nord Stream pipeline incident as evidence of US pressure to prevent a German-Russian alliance, which he sees as crucial for Germany's future due to Russia's resources and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. He suggests Germany's current leadership is acting under duress, with a "gun pointed at their heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

*   **Mustafa Kemal and the British**: The speaker discusses the similarities between Atatürk and Reza Shah Pahlavi (of Iran), both military figures who seized power and implemented similar Westernization and modernization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. He finds the idea that this was "directed from somewhere" exaggerated, suggesting it was more the "spirit of the age" and common global ideas for rebuilding states after WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. He believes Atatürk had a close relationship with British intelligence in the early stages of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>, citing a "staged fight" in Palestine/Syria in 1918 where the Ottomans withdrew strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. The British aimed to eliminate Enver Pasha's influence, keep France out of Turkey, and prevent Russian influence, finding Mustafa Kemal Pasha a suitable leader for a modern Turkish state with good relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

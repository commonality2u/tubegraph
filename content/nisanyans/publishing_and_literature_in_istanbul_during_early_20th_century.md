During the early 20th century, Istanbul's cultural and intellectual life saw the presence of significant figures in publishing and literature. The speaker's paternal grandfather was a notable writer and publishing house owner, deeply embedded in Istanbul's cultural and intellectual sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Publishing Activities

In 1922, the grandfather's publishing house was particularly active in publishing new and accurate translations of famous modern French literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This focus on translated works contributed significantly to the literary landscape of the period.

## Impact of Historical Events

The tumultuous period of the early 20th century, including events related to [[armenian_history_in_istanbul | Armenian history in Istanbul]], affected individuals and businesses within the publishing sector. While mass deportations were not widely implemented in Istanbul, an incident on April 24, 1915, saw the arrest and deportation of 150-200 prominent individuals to Anatolia, most of whom were never heard from again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The speaker's grandfather was among those arrested on that date, held for a period, and then released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Following the fall of Izmir in 1922, panic spread in Istanbul, leading to a mass migration of Armenians to France, a phenomenon that had not occurred in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The speaker's family, including the grandfather, migrated to France around September 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Revival of Literary Business

After approximately two to three years in Paris, the grandfather returned to Türkiye to revive his old publishing house, which had been dormant in his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He subsequently opened bookstores and second-hand bookseller shops around Beyazıt Square, near the current university's Faculty of Letters and Chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These shops became "one of the most well-known, most beloved and most key books of Istanbul" and continued to operate until the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Educational Landscape

The educational environment also played a role in the literacy and cultural development of the era. In 1915, all Armenian schools in Istanbul were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The speaker's grandmother, then a middle school student, had to attend a school established by French Jews for about two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This educational experience allowed her to learn French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Armenian schools eventually reopened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

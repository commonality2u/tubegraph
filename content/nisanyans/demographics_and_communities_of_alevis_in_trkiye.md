The exact number of Alevis in [[social_and_cultural_dynamics_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is not clearly known, with figures ranging from 8 million to 10 million mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Within this population, several distinct communities are identified.

## Major Alevi Communities

### Anatolian Turks
Approximately four to four and a half million Alevis are defined as Anatolian Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Zazas
The Zaza community is mentioned as having some historical connection to being Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Arab Alevis (Nusayris)
A significant community of Arab Alevis, also known as Nusayris, resides in the southern [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Hatay]] region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their beliefs are described as having a "much more radical line" compared to other Alevi groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Historically, Nusayris, who had little connection to Islam, joined the Alevi movement. Many were Christian converts in coastal Syria, including Arab Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Albanian Alevis
In [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Thrace]], there is a community of Albanian origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Their Alevi inclination is noted as potentially originating from Bektashiism in Southern Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Tahtacılar
The Tahtacılar are an element found in the [[ethnic_and_historical_background_of_regions_in_trkiye | Aegean and Mediterranean regions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Their origins are largely unknown, though they speak Turkish. A French researcher concluded that the Tahtacılar may be an element that existed before the arrival of Turks in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical Context of Alevi Community Formation
Alevism is described as a rebellion movement that emerged across Anatolia, Iran, and Syria at the end of the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This movement provided shelter for various groups opposed to the dominant Islamic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Groups that joined this movement include:
*   **Old Turkmen Elements** - These groups had been in constant rebellion since the 13th century, often refusing to pay taxes or conform to state-imposed religious norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Kurds** - A significant portion of the Kurdish population joined the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Armenians and Armenian Converts** - Some Armenians and those who had converted to Islam also joined the Alevi movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

The [[persecution_of_alevis_by_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman state's persecution]] of Alevis, including massacres, bans, and raids on villages, fostered integration and solidarity among diverse groups under the Alevi identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This long-standing oppression led to the formation of [[cultural_and_religious_dynamics_within_alevi_communities | secret codes, solidarity organizations, and a distinct culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Alevism is seen as a synthesis of these rebellious elements, rather than a direct continuation of ancient Turkish beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

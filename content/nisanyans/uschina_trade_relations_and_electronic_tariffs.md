Donald Trump's administration initiated a trade conflict by stating an intent to redesign the world economy and declaring a "war on [[impact_of_china_on_the_global_automotive_industry|China]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This led to significant global market instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Tariffs and Apple's Intervention
Initially, the Trump administration began imposing customs duties on goods from various countries, with the stated aim of "destroying [[impact_of_china_on_the_global_automotive_industry|China]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

However, a significant shift occurred after Apple's chairman, Tim Cook, reportedly called President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Following this call, Donald Trump reversed his decision and chose not to impose tariffs on electronic goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

This reversal was described as:
*   "the most humiliating defeat an American government has suffered in modern history and in the last 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   A "quick, clear and definitive defeat" in political life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Trump also removed customs duties from all countries except [[impact_of_china_on_the_global_automotive_industry|China]], and later even removed them from [[impact_of_china_on_the_global_automotive_industry|China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Assessment of Trump's Strategy
The speaker suggests that Trump's primary tactic was "bluffing" to intimidate opponents and extract concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. However, this strategy is inherently unsustainable because repeated false bluffs erode credibility, making future threats ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

The administration's announcements of grand initiatives, such as "conquering Greenland" or "declaring war on [[impact_of_china_on_the_global_automotive_industry|China]]", were often not followed through and resulted in defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The rapid collapse of the administration's claims regarding economic transformation, despite assurances from officials about "four-dimensional chess" and the "boss knowing everything", further demonstrated a lack of substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that it is difficult to foresee how long the Trump administration could maintain its power or be taken seriously given these political defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Alcohol Consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>

For two years, the speaker has been drinking only tea on the program, unable to consume [[alcohol_and_its_effects_on_health | alcohol]] due to diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Even a drop of [[alcohol_and_its_effects_on_health | alcohol]] affects him terribly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. He states he has never been a drinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While he used to enjoy a glass of whiskey during conversations and still does, it is no longer an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Smoking Habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

The speaker notes having quit smoking over 40 years ago, though he corrects this to "30-odd years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He quit cigarettes at 29 years old, at which point he was smoking 2 to 5 packs of Winston a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Despite having quit for decades, he smokes occasionally when facing a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This often leads to chain smoking: smoking one cigarette results in a rapid increase to 3, then 15, and eventually over two packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Challenges of Quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

The primary reason for these relapses is described as a "very routine life," which he calls "too boring," and a lack of social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The need for a cigarette often arises when he comes face-to-face with people and engages in a mutual exchange of ideas and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Once he starts smoking, he finds it difficult to quit again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He has experienced periods of heavy smoking for about two weeks or even a month or two, followed by quitting and then starting again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. At the time of the discussion, he had stopped smoking for almost a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

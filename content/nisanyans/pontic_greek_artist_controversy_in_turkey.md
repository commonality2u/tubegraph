A controversy arose in [[Turkey | Turkey]] regarding a concert performed by a popular Greek singer, Despina Vandi (or Vanda) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. The artist, who is of [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_Anatolia | Pontus]] Black Sea family origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>, performed a concert in front of portraits of [[analysis_of_atatrks_legacy_in_modern_Turkey | Mustafa Kemal Atat端rk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

From the perspective of Pontic Greeks, [[analysis_of_atatrks_legacy_in_modern_Turkey | Mustafa Kemal Atat端rk]] is viewed as responsible for the Pontic massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. This includes accusations of massacre, robbery, rape of women, deportation to concentration camps, and exile of simple peasants, farmers, and miners in countless villages and towns in [[cultural_and_linguistic_history_of_Anatolia | Pontus]] following 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. While the speaker notes that "whether it is true or false, how much truth there is in this is a separate story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>, this established image exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.

The act of inviting a widely popular Pontic Greek artist to perform in front of [[analysis_of_atatrks_legacy_in_ataturks_legacy_in_modern_Turkey | Atat端rk's]] portraits was seen as an end to the artist's career, rendering her a "traitor" in her own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

The speaker questions whether the organizers were ignorant or consciously attempting to create a crisis or diplomatic clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>. They suggest it appeared to be "a stupid incident rather than a conscious program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.

The Turk Education Foundation was identified as the organizer behind the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. This foundation was also responsible for decorating the country with large, blood-colored [[analysis_of_atatrks_legacy_in_modern_Turkey | Atat端rk]] portraits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a> and organizing the match scandal or fiasco in Saudi Arabia a couple of months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. The speaker ponders if these actions are part of a special program to maintain conflicts between [[Turkey | Turkey]] and neighboring countries, or simply due to "stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

The involvement of major powers in the [[historical_context_of_the_greco_turkish_war_1919_1922 | Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] was multifaceted, driven by post-World War I geopolitical considerations and the desire to manage public order in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Initial Intentions regarding Izmir and Ayvalık

At the Paris Peace Conference, Greece, considered an ally, was initially granted the authority to land troops in Izmir province and the district of Ayvalık <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This deployment, occurring a few days before May 16th, was intended as a "police operation" to maintain public order in Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The troops were also meant to provide a safe haven for Greek refugees who had been deported by the Turks from the entire Aegean Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Major powers like the British, French, Italians, and America, at that time, did not suggest the annexation of these territories by Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Izmir and Ayvalık were placed within the security area of the Greeks until a peace treaty could be finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_the_treaty_of_sevres_on_greco_turkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]]

The [[impact_of_the_treaty_of_sevres_on_greco_turkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]], signed in 1920, was described as a "very strange text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This treaty envisaged a five-year occupation of Izmir and Ayvalık, after which a referendum would be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The clear implication of this provision was that Izmir and Ayvalık would be given to the Greeks after this five-year transition period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The [[impact_of_the_treaty_of_sevres_on_greco_turkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] itself was considered a "stillborn treaty" because no one signed it, effectively serving as a "bargaining document" or a "threatening document" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Greek Offensive beyond Izmir

The major powers viewed the subsequent Greek military operations, especially those in 1920 and 1921 that extended beyond the Izmir province's borders into Western Anatolia (reaching the Sakarya River and aiming for Ankara), differently from the initial "police operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This expansion was not intended for the annexation of these new territories to Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Instead, its primary objective was to compel the Ankara government to surrender, bargain, accept the [[impact_of_the_treaty_of_sevres_on_greco_turkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] (or its amended versions), or to eliminate the Ankara government entirely and deal directly with Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It was considered an "operation of intimidation and punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Hypothetical Outcomes of a Greek Victory

If the Greek offensive had been successful in overthrowing the Ankara government:
*   A London Conference would have been held to reformulate the [[impact_of_the_treaty_of_sevres_on_greco_turkish_relations | Treaty of Sevres]] based on the new situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Greece would have secured Izmir and the Aegean coast due to its victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   A consortium or collective management, possibly involving Greeks, would have been established in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   The victory of Greece would have solidified England's position as the sole dominant player in the diplomatic field concerning [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]], intensifying the existing rifts with France and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Under British rule, Turkey would have eventually joined the "avengers camp" like Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, and Austria, seeking revenge for perceived injustices from the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Such a Turkey would likely have allied with Germany during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Assessment of Greek Chances

Major powers, including the British and French, were aware that Greece had little chance of winning a prolonged war against Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Despite the initial numerical equality of soldiers in 1922 (around 190,000-200,000 mutually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, Türkiye's population was four or five times larger than Greece's, and its economy was at least three times greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This meant that in a long-term conflict, Türkiye would "definitely be won" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

A war lasting longer than one or two years would make a Greek victory impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The only chance for the Greek army was a swift, decisive victory, requiring strong, continuous weapons, equipment, and financial support from England from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Once the conflict prolonged and became a "frontal war," especially after the Battle of Sakarya, Greece's chances were considered non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

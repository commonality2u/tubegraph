The recent Turkish elections have brought to light significant dynamics concerning the [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Kurdish political movement]] and its implications for Turkey's national unity.

## Election Outcomes and Kurdish Political Preferences

The speaker highlights a three-color map of Turkey's political landscape, where the middle of the country is completely yellow, the west has a thin strip of another color (Izmir to Istanbul, Thrace, Çanakkale, Muğla), and the southeast, including Tunceli and Kurdistan, forms a large block of yet another color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This third block, characterized by a distinct ethnic and cultural texture, is described as having around 80% strictly oppositionist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

The speaker expresses a long-held belief that such a geography, where over 80% of the population is homogeneously Kurdish, proud of their Kurdishness, and not considering themselves Turkish, cannot maintain its political unity with Turkey in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This perspective is reinforced by the latest election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

### Kurdish National Identity

The Kurdish population in the southeast is described as having a separate history, culture, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. In a state of high polarization, where societal masses are repelling each other, the political unity of Turkey is deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.

### HDP's Performance and Future

The HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party), representing [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Kurdish nationalism]], is seen as having made a significant political mistake by entering the orbit of the US and the European Union, particularly after the situation in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This alliance is viewed as detrimental, causing the HDP to go down with it in the recent election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

The HDP, or the party established in its place, showed a very poor performance and will not have a future without radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. The defeat does not mean the disappearance of the [[KurdishTurkish relations and nationalism in Turkey | Kurdish political movement]], but rather its re-establishment within a new formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. This new formation should directly and solely defend the national interests and the struggle for democracy and rights of the Kurds, rather than being swayed by slogans like "being Turkish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. Many current HDP cadres are expected to join this new formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The HDP's strategic mistake of taking the Turkish Workers' Party as a backup within an alliance is considered unforgivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

## Societal Dynamics and Political Divides

The speaker notes that the "We are winning" campaign in the first round of elections created a significant miscalculation, leading to severe disappointment and a lack of motivation among voters, making them feel there's no need for a second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>. This means the opposition faces the challenge of convincing its disappointed voters to return to the ballot box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>. The political landscape is clearly polarized, with voters firmly entrenched in their respective sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

The speaker highlights a significant historical lesson from Turkish political history: a right-wing party that allies with the Republican People's Party (CHP) often "dies" politically, while one that doesn't, tends to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. This analysis is applied to the situation of the Good Party and the MHP. The Good Party voters, described as middle-nationalist voters who dislike both the AK Party and the CHP/HDP, reacted by shifting their support to the MHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This shift is interpreted as a mission given to the MHP to act as a "watchman" for the government and the regime, safeguarding [[the_role_of_turkishness_as_a_unifying_element_in_trkiye | Turkishness]] and the flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.

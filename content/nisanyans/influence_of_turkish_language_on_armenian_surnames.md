The adoption and evolution of surnames among Armenians in the [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] reveal a significant [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_of_turkish_language | influence of the Turkish language]]. Prior to the 19th century, most Armenians, much like Turks, did not use surnames, with notable exceptions among the aristocracy and elite [00:00:44].

## Historical Context of Surname Adoption

Before the late 18th century, it was very rare for Armenians in the Ottoman Empire to possess surnames [00:00:44]. Individuals were often identified by their given name and place of origin, such as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" [00:00:58]. However, a rapid shift occurred starting around the 1820s, when nearly all Armenians acquired surnames with "lightning speed" [00:01:13]. These surnames became their primary form of identification [00:01:19].

## Dominance of Turkish Surnames

Overwhelmingly, the surnames adopted by Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during this period were Turkish [00:01:28]. This phenomenon is directly linked to the widespread use of Turkish as the mother tongue among the majority of Turkish Armenians by 1828 [00:01:35].

At that time, Armenian was often a language used only in church or for special situations, or not known at all by perhaps 100% of Armenians in the 1820s [00:01:58]. Even for those who spoke Armenian at home, Turkish was the "common language of public conduct" [00:02:14]. It was the language spoken in the bazaar, and there were no bazaars within Ottoman borders where Armenian was spoken [00:02:18]. Given that many Armenians worked in the bazaar and needed surnames that could be understood by their neighbors (Turks, Kurds, Greeks), Turkish became the practical choice for public identification [00:02:27].

### Common Surnames and Their Origins

The vast majority of early Armenian surnames were derived from two main categories:

*   **Professions**: Many surnames reflected the individual's occupation, such as:
    *   Pastırmacıyan (from *pastırmacı*, meaning pastirma maker) [00:00:06]
    *   Deveciyan (from *deveci*, meaning camel driver) [00:00:06]
    *   Nalbantyan (from *nalbant*, meaning farrier) [00:00:08]
    *   Terziyan (from *terzi*, meaning tailor) [00:00:08]
    *   This trend highlights the prevalence of Armenians in various trades and professions, in contrast to Turks who often held official duties or were villagers [00:03:43].
*   **Personal Characteristics**: Other surnames described a person's physical attributes or personality traits, for example:
    *   Boduryan (from *bodur*, meaning stumpy/short) [00:00:11]
    *   Boşgezenyan (from *boş gezen*, meaning idler/loiterer) [00:00:11]
    *   Çolakyan (from *çolak*, meaning lame/one-armed) [00:00:11]
    *   Surnames like "loquacious," "lame," or "toothy" were adopted [00:03:29].
*   **Patronymic Surnames**: A smaller number of surnames were based on the father's name, such as Sarkisyan or Hagopyan [00:02:58].

## Cultural and Linguistic Shifts

The 19th century witnessed a "great educational campaign" that revived Armenian and established it as a cultural language [00:01:41]. This cultural shift, coupled with the influence of modern nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, led some Armenian families with Turkish surnames to change them to Armenian equivalents [00:04:23]. For example, a surname meaning "jeweler" might have been changed to *Kenvosgeriyan* [00:04:31]. However, the "real old Armenian surnames" remained predominantly Turkish [00:04:37].

Interestingly, [[comparison_between_ottoman_and_iranian_armenian_surnames | Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames shortly after the Ottoman Armenians [00:04:48]. A key distinction, however, is that Iranian Armenian surnames typically ended in "-yant" (with a 'T' sound) instead of "-yan" [00:05:02]. This subtle difference reflects the "cultural difference of the two empires" [00:05:08].

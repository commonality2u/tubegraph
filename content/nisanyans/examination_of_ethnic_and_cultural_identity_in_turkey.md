## Historical Dynamics and Identity

In the 13th century Anatolia, the linguistic landscape was characterized by diglossia, where Persian served as the dominant language for state affairs, trade, poetry, and religious texts, while Turkish was the language spoken at home and for informal relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>. This contrasts with the modern-age illusion that people have only one mother tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>.

A significant political revolution occurred between 1305 and 1320, when the Ilkhanate State was collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>. During this period, Turkish rapidly emerged as a cultural language across a vast geography, including Anatolia, the Kipchak regions, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. Persian classics were translated into Turkish, and an abundance of Turkish texts, especially on Sufism, popular tales, novels, and poems, began to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. This event significantly fragmented the Iranian Persian cultural area and led to Turkish becoming a new cultural language in the west, east, and north of the former Mongol Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>.

In 1895, a Kurdish tribe raided Armenian villages in the Başkale district of Van, with the approval and support of the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Two years later, Dashnak Fedayi guerrillas organized an operation, putting the entire Kurdish tribe to the sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This event is remembered as the only military success in the history of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and is celebrated with pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. These events highlight [[historical_dynamics_of_ethnic_groups_in_turkey | historical dynamics of ethnic groups in Turkey]].

The population exchange between Turkey and Greece is viewed as one of the biggest murders against a country and humanity, described as a shameful act and a crime that should not have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. This reflects on [[cultural_reflections_and_historical_narratives_in_turkey | cultural reflections and historical narratives in Turkey]].

## Societal Attitudes and Political Implications

The question of whether an Alevi or Kurdish President can be elected in Turkey is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. Historically, Sunni Kurds have been at odds with the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey for the last 500 years, while the Ottoman Empire continuously tried to suppress Alevis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. The Turkish state has been in constant conflict with the Kurds for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a>.

There is a prevailing assumption among Turkish governing cadres, inherited through a "genetic memory," that Alevis and Kurds cannot maintain good terms with the Turkish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>. This leads to a lack of trust and an inability to predict their actions if they gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>. From the perspective of traditional state settings, this fear is considered legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>. However, this policy is criticized as extraordinarily backward, reflecting a mentality from 300 years ago, and significantly lowers the country's civilization level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>. Such a policy of excluding a large part of the population as "enemies of the state" necessitates restricting fundamental rights, ruling with force, or resorting to coups and dictatorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>.

The speaker notes that while the fear among state cadres is real, the solution should not be to retreat but to address the problem directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. These aspects strongly relate to [[alevi_identity_and_political_landscape_in_turkey | Alevi identity and political landscape in Turkey]], [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural dynamics and ethnic identities in Turkey]], and [[societal_attitudes_and_discrimination_in_turkey | societal attitudes and discrimination in Turkey]].

Turgut Özal, who was of Kurdish origin, became president by downplaying his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>. His Kurdishness was never publicly mentioned, and he consistently aligned with the lines of Turkishness and Islam, never making his Kurdish identity an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. This demonstrates that for individuals of any origin in the Ottoman Republic tradition, sincere loyalty to the state, Turkishness, and Islam, proven through various tests, can reluctantly allow them to hold significant positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>. The current government also includes a strong wing of Kurdish origin in key positions, but the crucial factor is whether individuals defend or highlight the collective identity of the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. The Turkish state has historically prevented those who emphasize their Kurdish identity from holding important public offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a>.

## Demographics and Future Projections

Kurds are noted for strongly adapting to social life across Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. Considering population trends, it is projected that Kurds are very likely to dominate Turkey in 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This is supported by their strong penetration into all areas of politics and economy, combined with a rapidly increasing Kurdish population, while the Turkish population is decreasing, with birth rates falling below two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. Furthermore, there is a weakening of the sense of national identity and a "wear and tear" among Turks that Kurds have not yet experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. These observations are central to [[cultural_dynamics_and_ethnic_identities_in_turkey | cultural dynamics and ethnic identities in Turkey]] and [[political_and_social_implications_of_ethnic_shifts_in_turkey | political and social implications of ethnic shifts in Turkey]].

## Religious and Cultural Symbols

The crescent and star symbol became associated with Islam during the Abbasid period, when it was embroidered on flags and used on coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. Its origin traces back to the city of Harran, where it was already a symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. Prior to that, during the Roman period, crescent and star coins and state symbols existed in the Middle East, particularly in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

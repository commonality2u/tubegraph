Following his departure to Samsun, it is alleged that [[mustafa_kemals_ability_to_selfcraft_his_narrative | Mustafa Kemal]] engaged in a "double game" during his time in Amasya and Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. This period raises questions about his actions after being dispatched to Anatolia by [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] and Damat Ferit Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Allegations of a "Double Game"

[[mustafa_kemals_ability_to_selfcraft_his_narrative | Mustafa Kemal]] was sent to Anatolia with "incredible authority" and an "important mission," with Sultan [[mustafa_kemals_association_with_vahdettin | Vahdettin]] sending him and Damat Ferit Pasha signing the decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. However, it is questioned how he "suddenly turn[ed] against them" after his arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Well, Damat Ferit Pasha signs the decree, they send you with incredible authority, they send you to Anatolia with an important mission, and then you suddenly turn against them. How did this happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

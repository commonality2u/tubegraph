The [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] and the [[Difference between alphabet and language revolution | language revolution]] are two distinct historical events in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] occurred in 1927-1928, while the [[Difference between alphabet and language revolution | language revolution]] began in 1932 and peaked in 1935, nearly five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. The [[Difference between alphabet and language revolution | language revolution]] specifically aimed to eliminate words of Arabic and Persian origin from Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Perceived Necessity

The need for an alphabet change in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] emerged as a necessity from the 1860s onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Most "sensible people" in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] began to view a writing revolution as a prerequisite for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

During the First Constitutional Era (1908-1918), the Ottoman ruling classes explored various ideas to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Initial thoughts included radically reforming the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic alphabet]] to make it a fully alphabetic script, expressing all vowels and consonants separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. There were also proposals to transform [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic letters]] into independent characters with changed shapes, similar to [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Latin alphabet]] characters used in printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Various attempts were made in this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Cultural Westernization as a Driving Force

From 1850 onwards, [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]]'s ruling, cultured, and educated classes experienced a complete shift in their cultural outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Their horizons and reference points gravitated towards the [[Western cultural and societal transformations | West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. All new ideas flowed from the [[Western cultural and societal transformations | West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Those with the means sent their children to [[Western cultural and societal transformations | Western]] cities like Geneva, Paris, and London for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. [[Western cultural and societal transformations | Western]] literary forms, clothing fashions, scientific developments, concepts of politics and law, journalistic styles, and article writing styles were all learned and imitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

In this context, the idea of making their alphabet like the [[Western cultural and societal transformations | Western]] one became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. The [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic alphabet]] posed significant challenges for writing Turkish, particularly in expressing vowels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While such issues are not insurmountable (e.g., the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Latin alphabet]] struggles to fully express English vowels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Latin alphabet]] adopted in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] is considered a more advanced alphabet, better suited for expressing fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. When attempting to write non-native words or place names that don't fit the sound structure of Turkish and [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic]] using the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic alphabet]], the results can be absurd, making pronunciation difficult to decipher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This difficulty in deciphering pronunciation from [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic script]] (e.g., in old maps or tax records) highlights its shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. In this regard, the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] can be seen as an inevitable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Arguments Regarding the Alphabet Revolution

Two primary arguments are often put forth regarding the alphabet revolution, though they lack substantial basis:

### Claim: Increased Literacy
It is often claimed that the alphabet revolution significantly increased literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, this claim cannot be logically proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. For example:
*   Iran preserved the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic alphabet]], despite it being a foreign alphabet for Persian (similar to Turkish), yet its literacy rate is comparable to [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   Israel uses an alphabet structurally similar to [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic]], which was foreign to most Jews until recent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Through systematic education, Israel achieved a near 100% literacy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
Therefore, the alphabet revolution in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] likely did not have a significant contribution to literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

### Claim: Aided Westernization
The argument that the alphabet revolution directly helped westernization is also largely untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. However, when a country's cultural structure and orientation undergo a significant shift towards the [[Western cultural and societal transformations | West]], a strong pressure for alphabet change is to be expected, making it seem inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Role of Non-Muslim Communities in the Shift

Another crucial factor contributing to the [[Alphabet Revolution in Trkiye | alphabet revolution]] was the vibrant publication scene in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]] from the mid-19th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Turkish novels and newspapers were widely published using [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians | Armenian]] and Greek letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. These Turkish newspapers, written in non-[[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic]] scripts, contained daily news, international news, stock market updates, jokes, and poems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

Many Muslims, particularly some Turks, began to prefer reading these publications over those written in [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic letters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Some even learned the [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians | Armenian alphabet]] specifically to read Turkish books and magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This was because both the [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians | Armenian alphabet]] and the Greek alphabet were significantly more successful than the old [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic script]] at conveying the nuances of spoken language, being much easier and more direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

With increasing literacy in [[historical_context_of_alphabet_changes_in_trkiye | Türkiye]], there was a growing possibility of people shifting towards the [[Cultural and linguistic shifts among Armenians | Armenian]] and Greek alphabets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This shift had to be prevented, and it was difficult to achieve this by simply using the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic alphabet]] or through a massive education campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This pressure from the popularity of Turkish written in non-[[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Arabic]] scripts likely played a role in the decision to adopt the [[Impact of the Arabic and Latin alphabets | Latin alphabet]].

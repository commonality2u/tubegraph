## Initial Reactions to Discussion
Announcing a meeting to discuss the [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion | relationship between reason and religion]] elicited strong, negative reactions from two diametrically opposed directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One perspective questioned if reason and language were even related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, while the other asked if reason and religion were opposites, viewing the claim of reason's independence from religion as making reason "another subject of faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Enduring Phenomenon of Religion

### Persistence of Belief
Despite non-belief becoming a social option, people empirically continue to believe in religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. An example is the Soviet Union, where 80 years of compulsory anti-religious propaganda in schools ironically led many to conclude that religion was a "very good thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Similarly, an "extraordinarily intelligent" Polish friend insisted on being a devout Catholic, explaining that in an oppressive, meaningless, and false public life, Catholicism offered a necessary anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### The Challenge for Rational Thought
The speaker emphasizes that the number of religious people is not decreasing despite scientific advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Therefore, intelligent people representing rational thought must seriously explain the phenomenon of religion, understand its reality and persistence, and answer the questions it poses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Ignoring or belittling religion is not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### A New Approach to Religious Discussion
The speaker aims to understand religion on a rational basis, discussing its boundaries and determining its scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is seen as a crucial activity for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The ultimate goal is to establish an institution that brings a rational approach to religion, possibly a Faculty of Theology, distinct from current vocational theology schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This endeavor is considered more important than traditional academic pursuits like mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The speaker's main purpose is not to destroy a believer's religiosity, as there is nothing to replace it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Instead, the focus is on reinforcing non-religious or undecided individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Current Approaches in Turkey
In Turkey, since the early 20th century, non-religious people have adopted one of three approaches to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>:
1.  Ignoring religious people as "not worth talking about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
2.  Crushing and silencing religious people, often invoking Atat√ºrk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
3.  Trivializing religion, for example, by suggesting "going to the disco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

These approaches have left religion to the monopoly of religious people, leaving rationalists without answers in debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Given the political and cultural consequences of religious influence, there is a "serious war" that must be conducted intelligently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## Defining Rational Thought and Science

### The Human Mind's Method
Rational thought, or a certain way of facing the truth, is seen as the basic engine of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Humanity constantly encounters incomprehensible data and copes by proposing and testing assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This method, applied from infancy to the most complex events, involves:
1.  **Observing patterns**: Such as a bell ringing at a certain hour or the sun rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
2.  **Formulating hypotheses**: Proposing explanations, right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
3.  **Testing hypotheses**: When contrary results appear, the theory is first questioned, then refined, and finally, if consistently contradicted, discarded for a more correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
This process of proposing falsifiable assumptions and being open to their refutation is the way of learning, the way of science, and a rational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Science as Method, Not Truth
The feature of science is not that it is true, but that it is a method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. All scientific propositions are falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. A scientific thesis is accepted until a "brighter and more original view" or strong contrary evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

### Critique of Positivism
Positivism is criticized for assuming that as knowledge increases, ignorance decreases, implying a fixed quantity of knowledge that can eventually be fully attained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. This leads to the perspective that "knowledge is in the monopoly of scientists and religion is a system of ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. The speaker argues that this approach makes knowledge into a "treasure" that is stolen when claimed to be ultimate, leading to the same point as faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

Instead, the speaker suggests that the more a person's knowledge increases, the more their ignorance increases, like realizing the vastness of the sea the further one goes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. Knowledge is infinite, and realizing this leads to acknowledging one's growing ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

## The Evolution and Nature of Faith

### Early Religion as Scientific Hypothesis
In its early stages, religion was part of scientific activity, offering hypotheses to explain incomprehensible events, such as jinns being responsible for people getting lost in a forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These hypotheses, like ancient Greek myths explaining victories through divine intervention, were early attempts at explanation and were falsifiable in principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Early religious texts like the Torah also contain what can be seen as scientific efforts to explain creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### Shift Towards Unfalsifiable Belief
Judaism marked a significant turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Unlike Greek gods, the Jewish God actively directs history, making questioning stories about this God politically risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This led to the emergence of an increasingly abstract God, loaded with incomprehensible features, whose existence and actions cannot be falsified by real-world evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. For example, any question about God's actions or the presence of evil has an answer, even if contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### The Essence of Faith
This evolution leads to the concept of [[unquestioning_faith_and_morality | unquestioning faith]], where belief is valued precisely because it lacks rational support. The speaker cites the example of Jesus telling Thomas that believing after touching his wounds has "no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. The doctrine of the *credibility of the absurd* (Tertullian: "I believe because it is absurd") embodies this notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

In contemporary discussions, the ultimate answer from a believer, when confronted with rational arguments against a practice (e.g., abstaining from pork), is often "because I believe this. I am not obliged to question this; I cannot question this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. This leads to a point where faith and reason "cannot meet in any way and on any ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Faith as Escape from Freedom
Religion can serve as a solution to the human need for "escape from freedom," as freedom can be tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. In older religions, truth was often based on what "our ancestors told everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. However, when ancestral knowledge becomes insufficient, the need for an "inhuman, non-human," infallible authority from "above" emerges, bridging the gap between science and certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. At this point, one surrenders their freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

### The Fragility of Faith
Despite the emphasis on [[unquestioning_faith_and_morality | unquestioning faith]], religious institutions constantly develop mechanisms to renew and strengthen belief throughout life, such as calls to prayer and various exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. This suggests that people's faith is not as strong as assumed, and there is a very strong possibility of falling out of faith, necessitating such intensive, organized, and expensive methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Religion's widespread and permanent nature stems from its response to a real human need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## Confronting Religion with Reason

### The Mary Example: A Rational Analysis of Religious Texts
The speaker proposes analyzing religious texts using a rational, common-sense approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. An example is the Quran's mention of Mary as the daughter of Imran and sister of Aaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Objectively, given the existence of Mary, mother of Jesus, and Miriam (Mary), sister of Moses and Aaron, in the Torah, the most likely conclusion is that the Quran's writer confused the two Marys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. While alternative hypotheses (another Imran, another Harun) exist, they lack strong evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

This rational analysis suggests that Muhammad, likely illiterate, acquired knowledge of the Torah and Bible indirectly through hearsay, leading to such confusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. The fact that errors like this were not corrected later in the Quran's finalized text is a point for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### Future Discussions
The speaker plans to delve into specific topics like the origins of holy books (Torah, Bible, Quran), a philological discussion about their origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Later topics will include the position of religion within Human Rights Law, limits of freedom of expression in religious matters, and the current religious position in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.

The ultimate aim is to "surround religion with reason," make it "harmless in a cocoon of reason," and ensure that reason acts as the "referee" in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. This means finding ways to explain religious data using a more rational and common-sense approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

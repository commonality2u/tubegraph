The primary function of science is not to seek the truth about the universe, although finding it as a side effect is considered an "additional benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Instead, the basic function of science is to identify and expose the mistakes of other scientists, specifically "registered science professionals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, with the motivation to "overthrow them" and "prove them wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This activity is driven by the desire to demonstrate "why they are wrong, where they made mistakes, why they are foolish, why they are too stupid to think about the factors and dimensions and perspectives that I can think of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. The fundamental motivation behind scientific work is the "issue of power and the re-adjustment of the balance of power within the institution and within the discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## Methods of Scientific Engagement

In academic work, the main technique for defeating other scientific professionals involves drawing "more accurate conclusions" from a shared knowledge base and methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, aiming for conclusions that are "more convincing," "more effective," and "more effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

There are several methods for success in the field of science:
*   **Silencing through shouting:** Overwhelming the other party with volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on authority:** Crushing opponents by gaining the support of higher authorities like rectors, deans, or the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Accurate reasoning and new facts:** Presenting more accurate reasonings within established basic principles and introducing new facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This method leads to overcoming rivals and ascending in the scientific world through debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

The third method is considered "the most noble, the most correct, the most beneficial to humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. For this method to function, common acceptances are required within the academic and cultural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. This includes a consensus on the basic actions of a scientific discipline and on the methods of reasoning and presenting evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Such a consensus implies the acceptance of reason and logic, acknowledging frameworks established by figures like [[aristotles_contributions_to_science_and_philosophy | Aristotle]] or Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Without a rational authority or arbitration institution, the effectiveness of this third method is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

## Decline of Scientific Consensus and its Impact
Since the 1970s, particularly in Western academic life, the necessary consensus for scientific discourse has been systematically destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. This destruction means that "everything can be generally accepted as true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>, and "nothing that the authority says is trusted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. Consequently, the possibility of expanding the scientific horizon through new data and reasoning on a common knowledge base has disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

This leaves only two methods for scientific engagement:
*   Silencing the other side through "lagaluga and satay" (meaningless talk and nonsense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.
*   Relying on authority, which can be the university administration, the state, public opinion, or a dictatorial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

This situation is described as "pathetic" and is believed to lead to "very big disasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Current Role of Academic Institutions
The current function of universities and institutes is largely to "train personnel for the state and private institutions, bureaucracies, large organizations, large companies, research organizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This often involves training "dysfunctional" personnel who do not produce anything of real-world value, but merely fill cadre needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. University education focuses on teaching bureaucratic working methods, such as paper writing, Excel usage, and techniques for presenting ideas within a bureaucratic institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. These functions are deemed "190% unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

A significant portion of university graduates, perhaps the majority, become "waste" globally because the institutions employ far fewer people than the number of students they educate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. They leave university as an "unemployable society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>, unable to contribute positively to society, and lacking practical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. University education fails to teach any art or profession useful outside bureaucratic institutions and prevents young people from developing useful skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. This leads to a tragic situation where highly educated individuals lack basic practical abilities and are left without a profession if they cannot find employment in their specialized, bureaucratic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.

## Science, Art, and Political Power
Historically, the production of science and art has been a *result* of political power and societal prosperity, rather than a cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>. When a society, civilization, or country becomes stronger, more prosperous, and gains the power to dominate others, it enters a "bright period" of scientific and artistic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. Without wealth, political power, military power, or economic power, a society generally cannot produce science and art, with very few individual exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>.

Strong societies typically possess two key advantages:
1.  **Patronage:** Wealthy and powerful individuals patronize, support, and "buy" intelligent, talented, and creative people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. They also have the "self-confidence to accept their ideas and statements that have not been heard before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Attraction of talent:** Such societies act like a magnet, attracting talented and skilled people from other societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>. An example is the United States after 1945, which used its economic and military power to attract qualified personnel and artists from across Europe and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>.

## The Nature of [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | Freedom of Thought]]
[[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | Freedom of thought]] is increasingly restricted, and its meaning is becoming confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. For [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] to exist, there must be a consensus on certain issues, especially regarding generating and discussing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. This consensus is typically held by "educated and experienced segments of the society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>, as generating and discussing ideas are skills gained through training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.

People with these skills must agree on a set of basic values or a "framework of thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. Within this framework, "infinite disagreement" is possible, and people can confidently discuss different opinions if their foundation is solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>. Without a common ground, [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] loses its meaning and devolves into chaos, as the "rules for one idea to defeat another are not clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. This absence of impartial evaluation leads individuals with different ideas to communicate only with those who agree with them, forming "closed bubble[s]" where ideas are mutually confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

For [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] to be functional, a series of main concepts must be accepted as arbiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. Since this consensus has been destroyed, [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] lacks functional meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. This trend is expected to lead to the rapid disappearance of perspectives advocating [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] from circulation, with people increasingly adopting attitudes against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.

Historically, [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] likely existed only among a certain caste or "elite concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. For [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] to exist, "arbiters of thought" are necessary, which is inherently not a democratic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>. Instead, "a select minority is always the arbiter of ideas," defining the common consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. In cases of conflict, a designated group, circle, or "Assembly of the Elder Beards" should decide what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>. This was evident in the 18th and 19th centuries, when [[the_importance_of_philosophical_thinking_and_its_limitations_in_solving_existential_questions | freedom of thought]] was most dominant in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>.

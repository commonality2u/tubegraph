## Upcoming Baptisms in Yerevan

The speaker's daughter, granddaughter (Alis), and grandson (Iris) are scheduled to be baptized and become members of the [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian church]] in Yerevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The son-in-law, Kaan, may also join them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This event is seen as bringing "two or three new members to the [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian religion]], the [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian sect]], the [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian church]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The speaker expresses pride and happiness regarding these upcoming baptisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Previously, the speaker had neglected to baptize their own children despite suggestions, but their daughter has now recognized this as a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Significance of the Ceremony

The baptism ceremony is planned to take place in the main church, which is described as the center of the [[religions_and_cultural_shifts_in_armenian_history | Armenian religious world]] (likely referring to Etchmiadzin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This location is highlighted as another source of pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Circumcision (Contrasting Practice)

When asked if circumcision is practiced within the Armenian church, even in [[armenian_history_and_heritage_in_turkey | TÃ¼rkiye]], the speaker states a complete opposition to circumcision on principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

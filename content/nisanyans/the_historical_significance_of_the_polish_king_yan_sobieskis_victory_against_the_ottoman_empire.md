## The 1683 Siege of Vienna

In 1683, the Ottoman Empire, which had been in a state of stagnation for over a century, attempted to conquer Vienna under the leadership of Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This ambition was driven by the idea that they could achieve what SÃ¼leyman the Magnificent could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. By this period, the Ottomans had already lost their technological and economic superiority compared to European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>, and their wars had become prolonged, blind struggles without significant territorial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

The Ottoman army besieged Vienna for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Unexpectedly, Polish King Jan Sobieski arrived from the north with a cavalry army, estimated to be 100,000 strong, and delivered a terrible defeat to the Turkish army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

## Immediate and Long-Term Consequences for the Ottoman Empire

The [[historical_analysis_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_decline | Ottoman Empire]] never fully recovered from the destruction of this defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, which marked the beginning of a decline that lasted until [[world_war_i_and_the_ottoman_empire | 1918]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

Key consequences included:
*   **Territorial Losses** Within three years, all of Hungary was lost, followed by the loss of Serbia in ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>. Western armies, including Austrian and Hungarian forces, advanced as far as Thessaloniki and southern Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. French intervention, seeking to prevent Austria's excessive strengthening, led to Austria's retreat and allowed Serbia to remain under [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman rule]] for another 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Administrative Collapse** The defeat caused a tremendous shock, leading to the collapse of all administrative and military control in the Balkans, which could not be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
*   **Rise of Principalities** Numerous principalities emerged within [[historical_perspectives_on_turkish_conquest_of_anatolia | Anatolia]], including regions like Lazistan, eastern provinces, Egypt, and central Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. These entities collected their own taxes, maintained armies, and often challenged the Ottoman Empire, paying only occasional tribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. From 1680 onwards, effective [[historical_influences_on_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman rule in Anatolia]] ceased until the [[historical_discussions_on_ottoman_empire_reforms | Tanzimat period]] in the 1820s, a period of 140 years where the empire survived largely on inertia without proper tax collection, leading to widespread ruin in the provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.

## Western Perception and Geopolitical Shift

The Battle of Vienna fundamentally altered Western perceptions of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Despite its continued existence, the empire was no longer seen as the invincible superpower it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

The primary reason Western states did not fully exploit the Ottoman weakness and conquer Istanbul was the intense competition and rivalry among European powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. An attempt by one power, such as Austria, to conquer Istanbul would have led to conflicts with other major states like France, Prussia, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. From this point, [[ottoman_empire_and_international_politics | Europe's foreign policy]] shifted from a unified stance against the Muslim world to one focused on managing the balance of power among themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. The Ottoman Empire was no longer the primary threat; rather, the internal struggles and jealousies between European states became the dominant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

The 1683 victory is considered a crucial turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. Its anniversary is still remembered, particularly in Poland, where "Sobieski fashion" and related shares appear on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

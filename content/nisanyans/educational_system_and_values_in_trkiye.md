## Architecture and Cultural Narratives
The Beyazidiye Complex in Edirne, built during the reign of Beyazıt II, is described as a large Ottoman complex encompassing a mosque, madrasah, and hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Its architecture is characterized by a "rational and completely totalitarian understanding of art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, being "extremely abstract, extremely rational, extremely geometric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This architectural style is founded on producing complex structures from simple geometric forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

This style reflects a "very modern understanding of architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, which does not allow for ornamentation and is a mathematical understanding of art serving as a show of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a perception among the public that associates a "backward, ignorant" culture with the architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Ottoman and Islamic Education Systems
The concept of "text within text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05">[00:09:05]</a> entered world literature through medieval Islamic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Western and European universities adopted this approach from Islamic madrasahs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, where a single text is accepted and extensively discussed, with comments, side notes, and footnotes added by successive authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

The Ottoman education system, while acknowledged as weak and full of gaps in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:31">[00:58:31]</a>, ensured that almost every town and many villages had a school and a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. These teachers, often bearded figures, would teach basic Quran, stories, and the common knowledge, myths, and narratives that formed the society's shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. For Muslims in Ottoman society, the basis of dispute resolution and social order was rooted in religion, specifically Sunni Islam, represented by the Hodja and a legal and educational system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

### Limitations of Rational Islam
Islam is described as a "very geometric religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>, a "religion of rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>, and a "rational religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>, with intricate details regarding inheritance and daily practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. However, this rational and legalistic approach to religion was considered inadequate for meeting certain basic psychological needs of people, specifically the "need for magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>, such as seeking miraculous outcomes through prayers or visits to saints' tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

Religious sects emerged to fulfill these charismatic religious needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, providing an outlet for enthusiasm, music, and emotional expression that the formal religious authorities (Hodja and legal system) could not provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. While the rational, bookish Islam appealed to the ruling and intellectual classes, providing prestige and stimulating discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>, it was insufficient for the common people, especially the poor and ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>. The popularity of religious orders and their magical worldview thus became a crucial support for these segments of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

The traditional Ottoman elite and modern self-proclaimed "secular" intellectuals share an attitude of looking down on the psychological needs of the ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>. This disconnect highlights a persistent challenge in [[social_and_political_issues_in_trkiye | Turkish society]] regarding understanding and addressing the needs of different social strata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.

## Critiques of Modern Education and Societal Values
The contemporary education system in Türkiye, and globally over the last 40-60 years, is criticized for having forgotten the teaching of fundamental values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

### Core Values for Education
Three basic things schools *should* teach are proposed:

1.  **Honor (Şeref)**: This is considered paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. It's the conviction that one would rather die than lose one's honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>. Honor is seen as the antithesis of pleasure, teaching one to look down on immediate self-interest and selfish pleasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>. The current education system, particularly in Türkiye, is accused of having forgotten this, instead glorifying dishonor and teaching a philosophy of trickery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:36">[01:53:36]</a>.
2.  **Modesty (Nezaket)**: While seemingly opposite to honor, modesty is crucial to balance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>. Honor can lead to tyranny and arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. Modesty means upholding principles while maintaining kindness towards others, even enemies, and being willing to offer a helping hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:09">[01:55:09]</a>. This includes the maturity to yield one's turn when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:32">[01:55:32]</a>.
3.  **Love of Science (Bilim Aşkı)**: This involves a deep reverence for truth, simply because it is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. It is the duty to expand the boundaries of truth and understanding, encompassing both theoretical and practical sciences (love of technique) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:25">[01:56:25]</a>. This is the willingness to sacrifice time, health, and effort to learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>.

It is argued that if a person possesses these three core values, they will quickly and easily learn everything else necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. The rest of what schools teach is considered irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This perspective highlights significant [[failures_in_the_turkish_education_system | failures in the Turkish education system]] and possibly reflects a critique of [[kemalism_and_critique_of_turkish_education_system | Kemalism and critique of Turkish education system]].

## Social and Economic Aspirations of Youth
The younger generation, particularly those aspiring to be CEOs or earn money from crypto exchanges, are seen as directionless, uneducated, ignorant, and helpless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. It is deemed morally wrong to judge them, as they live in a "terrible world" where "all exits are closed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>, and they lack the necessary equipment to cope due to the collapse of the education system worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

While a desire to become a "boss" is considered a "better thing" than aiming to be a bureaucrat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>, directly aiming to be a CEO after graduation is seen as a wrong goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. To climb a bureaucracy, one must first become a "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>, and after 5 years, there's little chance of escaping that slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. The current system offers few options other than working as a salaried employee, where earning sufficient money is difficult, leading to a vicious cycle for those who aspire to be bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. The crypto market is seen as a form of gambling, highlighting the lack of viable alternatives for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. This reflects the broader [[social_decay_and_violence_in_trkiye | social decay and violence in Türkiye]] and limited opportunities.

Since 1974, [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey's relations with Western countries]] have significantly deteriorated, a change primarily attributed to the 1974 Cyprus intervention and the subsequent policy of denying the Armenian Genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.

## Impact of the Cyprus Intervention
In 1974, [[the_impact_of_turkeys_cyprus_intervention_on_international_relations | Turkey's Cyprus operation]] led to an immediate and significant loss of international standing in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>. Before this event, [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]] had a strong reputation and was considered a valued ally in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. However, the [[the_impact_of_turkeys_cyprus_intervention_on_international_relations | Cyprus incident]] was perceived as a serious trauma, violating basic principles of the international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This event led to a strong negative sentiment against [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]] in countries like America, France, and England, and [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey's relations with the West]] "never held together again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Immediately following the intervention, there were demonstrations and attacks on Turkish institutions and embassies across the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>. Organizations like ASALA, whose origins remain unclear, emerged and began targeting Turkish institutions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.

## Armenian Genocide Denial Policy
The [[the_impact_of_turkeys_cyprus_intervention_on_international_relations | Cyprus operation]] also saw the Armenian Genocide brought back to the forefront in the Western press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>. While the Soviet Union had first raised the issue in 1965 in Soviet Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>, it was after 1974 that America adopted a policy of using the genocide as a "stick to beat [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

In response, [[turkeys_policy_towards_the_genocide_over_the_years | Turkey]] chose a policy of outright denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. This policy, advocated by figures like Cem Coşkun Kırca and Kamuran İnan, was considered "stupid" and "fiasco" by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. The world perceived [[turkeys_policy_towards_the_genocide_over_the_years | Turkey's]] denial of its "past crimes" as "shamelessness" and "rudeness," providing an excuse to provoke and hurt [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

### Brief Period of Hope (2005-2012)
From 2005 to 2011-2012, a "window of hope" emerged for [[turkeys_policy_towards_the_genocide_over_the_years | Turkey]] to abandon its denial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. During this period, the genocide was openly discussed in [[turkeys_policy_towards_the_genocide_over_the_years | Turkey]] for the first time, with many, including some in mainstream media, advocating for confronting the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Despite a desire at a private level to resolve the issue, the official level lacked the courage to take this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook
The denial policy has continued for over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. The speaker argues that denying the genocide is either "complete ignorance" or "immoral," and most often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. This stance continues to be a "deadlock" for [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.

In recent years, [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | Turkey's high-level political structure]] has diverged significantly from that of the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:14">[01:57:14]</a>. The West, in general, has also "ceased to be an attractive model" globally, becoming perceived as a "hated, mad, senile nuisance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. This shift indicates a broader change in [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | global geopolitical dynamics]], moving away from solely Western models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Despite these tensions, the speaker notes that the legal systems for daily disputes in [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Western countries]] (like Germany, France, Greece, and America) are "more or less all the same thing" as in [[relations_between_turkey_and_western_countries | Turkey]], though corruption and prejudice exist everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a>.

Regarding [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey-Greece relations]], elements within the Greek military anticipate a serious war with [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>. The "Blue Homeland" defense concept in [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]] is linked to the discovery of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:31">[01:45:31]</a>. [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]] was initially excluded from gas agreements by a triple alliance of Israel, Egypt, and [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Greece]], which [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]] viewed as unwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. This led [[turkeygreece_relations_and_geopolitical_tensions | Turkey]] to assert its control over these resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:14">[01:46:14]</a>. However, [[global_geopolitical_changes_and_turkeys_position | alliances are changing very rapidly]] in the context of the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>.

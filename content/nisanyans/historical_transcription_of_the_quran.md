The historical transcription of the Quran is a subject marked by significant [[Controversies and fallacies around the Qurans compilation | fallacies]] and varying accounts, particularly concerning the age and uniformity of early Quranic texts compared to modern copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Claims of a 1400-year-old Quran being 99.5% similar to today's copies are met with skepticism regarding the actual age of such a text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Transmission and the Arabic Script

Serious data regarding the extent, location, or script of the Quran's initial writing 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad is largely absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Before the late 7th century, there is little to no reliable information, only a series of half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### State of Early Arabic Writing
During the time of Muhammad and the 60 years following, the [[Creation and codification of the Arabic script | Arabic script]] was rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It consisted mainly of graffiti, worship scribbles of three to five words, and lacked dots or vowel movements that characterize later Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This early script was distorted and primarily useful for notes, not for extensive literary works or letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The idea that Arabic, a tribal language, could be written did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Prevailing Written Languages
The dominant written languages in the Middle East at the time were high-level languages like Latin, and specifically [[Aramaic and Syriac influences on Quranic texts | Syriac script]], which was used by both Jews and Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This was the script used for significant writings during Muhammad's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Codification of the Arabic Script
The [[Creation and codification of the Arabic script | Arabic script]] was first codified around the 680s, during the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This codification, essentially the invention of the standardized [[Creation and codification of the Arabic script | Arabic script]], was done with the specific purpose of writing the Quran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Claims vs. Historical Evidence of Compilation

### Fabricated Early Compilation Claims
The claim that a commission was established during the time of Muhammad and Hz. Uthman to write down the Quran is considered a fabrication, devised approximately 180 years after the events during the Abbasid period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This narrative, particularly the story of Uthman's compilation, emerged from a psychological need to believe the Quran was written down earlier than it actually was, to alleviate discomfort about a long gap between Muhammad's death and its compilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Umayyad Era Compilation
Scientific and objective information indicates that the Quran was compiled around 680 CE during the Umayyad period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Before this point, the Quranic text existed primarily as a "little message" transmitted orally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Adherents memorized and recited these texts in mosques every Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, there is no reliable way to ascertain the authenticity of this oral transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Regional Variations and Political Influence

When the Quran reached the stage of being written down, there were different traditions present in various cities and regions, including Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. People had different versions of verses, stating "We don't know that verse like that, we know it like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### The Role of Political Influence
These differing traditions were silenced by the order of Hajjaj, a prominent figure in the Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Subsequently, a unified text was created that aligned with the [[Role of political influence in Quranic transcription | political interests]] of the common Umayyad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This compilation occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Hz. Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

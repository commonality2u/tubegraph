Postmodernism is an architectural movement that emerged as a reaction against the international Modernism movement, which dominated the world in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. [[Modern architecture aesthetics | Modernist architecture]] is often characterized by simple, quadrangular glass-covered buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Characteristics and Origins
Postmodernism in architecture was invented in the 1960s and became widely used in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. A key characteristic of postmodern architecture is its decorative use of themes and perspectives from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. It is seen as a critical, ironic, or constructive approach to modernism, rather than just criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

An example of [[Modern architecture aesthetics | postmodern architecture]] could be a large modern block that incorporates decorative elements like Ottoman checkers on the roof eaves or features reminiscent of Mediterranean village architecture on its facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. It represents a "sarcastic" or "winking" point of view, questioning the absolute dominance of 20th-century modern design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

## Cultural Reflection
While everyone today is a product of the modern age, since the 1980s, full-hearted and unquestioning defense of pre-modern or even modern principles has become difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This suggests a broader [[Critique of modern Western art and culture | cultural shift]] where traditional forms and ideas are re-evaluated and sometimes re-integrated with irony or critical distance. The term "postmodern" itself can be used to describe this cultural phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Historically, communist parties represented a significant portion of the European political landscape, particularly after World War I, where they commanded nearly half (40-50%) of the political spectrum and were strong enough to win elections in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>. However, their influence began to decline in the mid-1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>, leading to a widespread collapse across the [[geopolitical_dynamics_and_potential_alliances_in_europe | Western world]] after 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.

## Reasons for the Collapse

The collapse of communist parties is attributed to three primary factors:

### Decline of the Working Class Movement
The primary source of power for communist parties was their deep roots in the European working class movement, which had been active for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>. This movement, encompassing trade unionism and the fight for workers' rights, aimed to improve the status of the working class in society and eventually influence administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. However, after 1945, the working class movement rapidly lost its influence, weakened, and became marginalized, disappearing as an organized political force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. This eroded the core belief and fighting strength of communist parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

### End of Soviet Support
During the Cold War, communist parties were instruments of the [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_soviet_union_and_gorbachevs_legacy | Soviet Union]], receiving significant external support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>. This support included organizational and financial aid, educational opportunities, and a sense of international solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>. With the [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_soviet_union_and_gorbachevs_legacy | collapse of the Soviet Union]], and even starting from the time of [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_soviet_union_and_gorbachevs_legacy | Gorbachev]] in 1987-88, this support was cut off, leading to the collapse of many parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>.

### Cessation of Persecution
A sense of brotherhood and solidarity among communists was fostered by common struggles and persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. Members faced imprisonment, house searches, police insults, and other forms of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. However, as [[comparative_views_on_russia_and_western_europe | Western states]] ceased prosecuting communist parties, the shared experience that bound members began to diminish, leading to a decline in their morale and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

## Case Studies in Europe

*   **General Decline**: After 1991, communist parties throughout the [[geopolitical_dynamics_and_potential_alliances_in_europe | Western world]] largely "fell apart, were finished, dissolved, and erased from the scene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
    *   Some tried to adapt by focusing on issues like women's rights, which proved to be a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.
    *   Others, adhering strictly to Marxism, became very small and irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>.
    *   The French Communist Party, for example, now receives only 2% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>.
    *   In Italy, the Communist Party disintegrated into eight parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>.
    *   Spain no longer has a Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.
    *   The Portuguese Communist Party received around 3.5% in recent elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

*   **Greece**: The Greek Communist Party is an exception, still garnering about 7% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>, making it one of the strongest in [[geopolitical_dynamics_and_potential_alliances_in_europe | Europe]] (second to France in absolute terms, but much higher proportionally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. This resilience is due to its history of intense persecution:
    *   A very bloody [[yugoslavias_political_history | civil war]] in the 1940s between communists and others, whose memories are still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a>.
    *   Heavy prosecution during the Greek colonels' junta (1967-1974), where communists were imprisoned, tortured, and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. The memories of these struggles continue to sustain the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

*   **Turkey**: The Communist Party in Turkey (TKP) was officially closed in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>. Before that, it was primarily a small group of intellectuals and a bureaucracy funded by [[comparative_views_on_russia_and_western_europe | Moscow]] or East Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:49">[01:36:49]</a>. The TKP founded after 2000 is considered a "police organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>, managed and funded by police and intelligence, and holds minimal electoral presence, receiving around 0.1% of votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>.

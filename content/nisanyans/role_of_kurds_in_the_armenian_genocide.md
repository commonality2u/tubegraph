The role of Kurds in the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] and the events leading up to it is a complex and significant aspect of [[historical_context_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The events of 1915 are considered the "final blow" of a longer process of "massacre, expulsion, usurpation and collapse" that had been ongoing for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Context Before 1915

Prior to 1915, the "real tyrant" for Armenians, the element that caused them to be tired of their lives and flee their homeland, was identified as the Kurdish element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Kurds, particularly those under the control of Kurdish tribal leaders and later Kurdish sect sheikhs, were described as "experts in killing Armenians, seizing their daughters, robbing their properties, burning their churches, and beheading their priests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

For a long time, until the last quarter of the 19th century, Armenians consistently viewed Turks and the [[kurdish_collaboration_with_ottoman_state | Ottoman State]] as their allies and protectors against Kurdish aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It was typical for Armenians to seek refuge with the Ottoman governor against attacks from Kurdish aghas, seeking help and safety from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Role in 1915

The events of 1915 represent a "conscious and cold-blooded decision" by the Union and Progress administration of the Turkish state and the Ottoman state bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This was not merely a pogrom but an "annihilation project" designed to "completely cleanse the Armenian problem" that had persisted for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

In carrying out this project, the Turkish state utilized Kurdish Bey aghas and the Kurdish people as "allies and as helpers and subcontractors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was facilitated by an already "existing tradition of massacre and extortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The state successfully leveraged this in the Eastern provinces by effectively granting permission to "do whatever you want," assuring that "the state is behind you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Changes in Kurdish Attitudes

In recent decades, there has been a radical shift in Kurdish attitudes towards the [[changes_in_kurdish_attitudes_towards_the_armenian_issue | Armenian issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. After 1880, as the opportunities for looting, usurping property, or taking women as concubines diminished, Kurds reportedly "came to their senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They recognized their precarious position, realizing they were now "face to face with the Turkish state" and risked destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

There is a growing sentiment among some, including Besim Tibuk, that Kurds should confront the [[armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This represents a significant development in the ongoing discourse surrounding the [[commemoration_of_the_armenian_genocide | Armenian Genocide]] and [[the_role_of_kurdish_political_movement_and_national_unity | Kurdish national unity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. It is suggested that if Turks were to overcome their prejudices and ignorance like the Kurds, it would be a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

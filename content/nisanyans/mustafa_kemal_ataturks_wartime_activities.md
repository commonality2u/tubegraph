If one were to have a candid conversation with [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] away from his imposing presence, several crucial questions about his wartime activities would arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Unexplained Absence and Accusations Post-Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

After his return from Damascus, during World War I, [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] was on duty on the Syrian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This period saw his involvement in "dark events" similar to those linked to Cemal Pasha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His name was even associated with a coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Furthermore, he faced accusations of corruption, specifically for allegedly selling army horses and pocketing the proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Subsequently, he was pardoned from all his duties and was reportedly missing for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This raises a significant question: why was one of the Ottoman state's most talented and successful commanders without duty during the most intense days of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>? Approximately six months later, he was assigned a very sensitive and serious political task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Appointment as Vahdettin's Political Caretaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

Another key inquiry concerns the backstory of his appointment as Vahdettin's "host" or political caretaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In December 1917, Vahdettin became the new crown prince, with Sultan Reşad expected to die soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:03:12]</a>. Vahdettin was sent on a long visit to Germany, the Ottoman ally, and [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] was assigned as his political caretaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:31]</a>. This was a highly sensitive and vital task, especially considering Vahdettin was over 60, had never been involved in politics, and was described as a shy, cowardly old gentleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:47]</a>. This assignment occurred while a life-or-death war was being fought, and Vahdettin was to meet influential figures like the German Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Unexplained Holiday and Diary in Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

A third question would be about his activities in Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In May and June of 1918, during a critical period when the war was going poorly, [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks personal life and diaries | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] was sent for a prolonged holiday and treatment to the Karlsbad hot springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:44]</a>. Before Karlsbad, he stayed in a Vienna hostel for three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:50]</a>.

Intriguingly, a diary from this period was published, containing seemingly mundane entries about walks and a barking dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:05:18]</a>. The existence of such a simple diary for a commander holding politically sensitive posts, sent on a two-month holiday during wartime, raises suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The "Double Game" from Samsun to Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

Finally, a direct question would be about the "double game" he allegedly played after going to Samsun, extending through Amasya and even to Erzurum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:13]</a>. [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturks political appointments | Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] was dispatched by Vahdettin with a crucial mission, and Damat Ferit Pasha signed the decree granting him incredible authority to go to Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:35]</a>. The sudden turn against those who sent him prompts the question of how this transition occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:41]</a>.

Engaging in these conversations would likely be extensive, as powerful figures often craft their own narratives, leaving little room for easy questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:07:39]</a>.

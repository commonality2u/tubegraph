The adoption of surnames by [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] in the 19th century set a precedent that was also followed by Iranian Armenians, particularly concerning the widespread use of Turkish surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Background: Surname Adoption in the Ottoman Empire

Prior to the end of the 18th century, surnames were very rare among [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]], primarily limited to aristocratic or elite families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Most common people, like Turks of that era, were identified by a personal name and their place of origin, for example, "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

A "surname revolution" or "surname reform" took place starting around the 1820s, during which almost all Armenians rapidly acquired surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. From this point, individuals began to be known by these new surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The [[impact_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Impact of Turkish Language]]

The overwhelming majority of these newly adopted surnames were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This was largely due to the fact that by 1828, Turkish was the mother tongue for the vast majority of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Although a significant educational campaign in the 19th century later revived Armenian as a cultural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, in the 1820s, many Armenians either did not know Armenian at all or used it only in religious or specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Even for those who spoke Armenian at home, Turkish was the common language for public interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Marketplaces within Ottoman borders did not use Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, so surnames needed to be easily declared and understood by neighbors of various ethnicities, including Turks, Kurds, and Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Most of these surnames reflected either a [[professional_and_characteristic_names_in_armenian_surnames | profession]] (e.g., Pastırmacıyan, Deveciyan, Nalbantyan, Terziyan) or a [[professional_and_characteristic_names_in_armenian_surnames | personal characteristic]] (e.g., Bodur Yan, Boşgezenyan, Çolakyan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. While some adopted patronymic surnames like Sarkisyan or Hagopyan, the majority were Turkish in origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The prevalence of professional names also stems from the fact that Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were often engaged in specific trades, unlike Turks who might have had official duties or been villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

While some Armenian families, influenced by modern nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, changed their Turkish surnames to Armenian equivalents (e.g., "jeweler" to "Kenvosgeriyan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, the original or "old" Armenian surnames typically remained Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Iranian Armenians and Turkish Surnames

Interestingly, [[impact_of_turkish_language_on_armenian_surnames | Iranian Armenians]] followed the trend of [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Armenians]] by also adopting Turkish surnames shortly after the Ottoman Armenian surname reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A notable distinction, however, lies in the surname suffix: Iranian Armenian surnames commonly end with a 'T' sound, typically as 'yant', in contrast to the 'yan' suffix prevalent among Ottoman Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This difference reflects broader cultural distinctions between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

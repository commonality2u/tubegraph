Prior to the late 18th century, surnames were uncommon among [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]], with exceptions primarily limited to the aristocracy and elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Common individuals, much like Turks of the era, did not typically possess surnames; for example, one might be known as "Agapol Hachadur from Sivas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Rapid Adoption of Surnames

A significant shift occurred around the 1820s, when [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians]] rapidly adopted surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. From that period onward, individuals began to be known by their new surnames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Prevalence of Turkish-Derived Surnames

The overwhelming majority of these newly acquired Armenian surnames were Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This was largely due to Turkish being the mother tongue for most [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Turkish Armenians]] in the [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] by 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The common language for public interaction and commerce, particularly in bazaars, was Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There were no bazaars within [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman]] borders where Armenian was primarily spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. As many [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians]] worked in these public spaces, surnames needed to be understandable to their neighbors, including Turks, Kurds, and Greeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### The Role of Language

In the 1820s, nearly 100% of [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians]] either did not know Armenian at all, or used it only in specific situations like church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Although the 19th century saw a significant educational campaign that helped revive Armenian as a cultural language, Turkish remained the dominant language for public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This linguistic environment played a crucial role in the adoption of Turkish-based surnames.

## Types of Surnames Adopted

In the first quarter of the 19th century, the vast majority of Armenian surnames were derived from either:
*   **Professional names** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, such as:
    *   Pastırmacıyan (from *pastırmacı*, meaning pastrami maker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Deveciyan (from *deveci*, meaning camel driver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
    *   Nalbantyan (from *nalbant*, meaning farrier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
    *   Terziyan (from *terzi*, meaning tailor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
    *   Other examples include "shoemaker" or "shrimp exporter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    This trend reflects that [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Armenians]] often held specific professions, unlike Turks who were typically engaged in official duties or were villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Personal characteristics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, such as:
    *   Boduryan (from *bodur*, meaning short/stocky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Boşgezenyan (from *boşgezen*, meaning idler/loiterer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Çolakyan (from *çolak*, meaning one-armed/lame) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Other examples include "loquacious" or "toothy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

A small number of surnames were derived from a father's name, such as Sarkisyan or Hagopyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### The "-yan" Suffix

The suffix "-yan" was commonly appended to these Turkish words to form the surnames, effectively meaning "son of" or "belonging to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Influence of Nationalism

Towards the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, some families with Turkish surnames changed them to Armenian ones, influenced by modern nationalism. An example is a family with a Turkish surname changing it to "Kenvosgeriyan," meaning "jeweler" in Armenian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, the original, older Armenian surnames primarily remained Turkish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Iranian Armenians

Interestingly, [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames | Iranian Armenians]] also adopted Turkish surnames shortly after the [[armenian_surnames_in_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Armenians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A notable difference is that [[iranian_armenians_adoption_of_turkish_surnames | Iranian Armenian]] surnames typically end in "-yant" (with a 'T' sound) instead of "-yan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, reflecting a cultural distinction between the two empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

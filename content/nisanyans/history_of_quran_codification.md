The perception that a 1400-year-old Quran in a university is 99.5% similar to modern copies is challenged by historical analysis [00:00:02]. The subject of the Quran's compilation is described as "obscured with so many fallacies" [00:00:29]. From a non-Islamic perspective, the [[analysis_of_the_quranic_text_from_a_nonislamic_perspective | analysis of the Quranic text from a non-Islamic perspective]] reveals that the Quran was written down approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Prophet Muhammad [00:00:45]. There is no serious data regarding what was written before this period, where, or in what script [00:00:55]. These pre-codification accounts are considered a "series of fallacies, a series of half-truths" [00:01:07].

## Development of the Arabic Script

The [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] as it is known today, specifically for the purpose of writing the Quran, was first codified around the 680s during the time of Caliph Abdul Malik [00:01:17], [00:01:23].

Prior to this codification, during the time of Muhammad and for 60 years following his death, the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic script]] consisted mainly of short graffiti or religious scribbles of three to five words [00:01:31], [00:01:48]. This early script lacked the dots or vowel markings present in later Arabic [00:01:51], making it a "distorted version" suitable only for taking notes [00:01:59]. There were no literary works, letters, or extensive texts written in [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic]] at that time [00:02:13], [00:02:15].

The prevalent written language in the Middle East at the time was the [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Syriac script]] [00:02:33]. This was a high-level language, comparable to Latin, used by educated individuals, including Jews and Christians [00:02:20], [00:02:25], [00:02:35]. The idea that [[origins_of_the_arabic_script | Arabic]], then considered a tribal language, could be used for extensive writing did not yet exist [00:02:48].

## Compilation and Political Influence

The claim that a commission was established during the time of Muhammad and during the era of Caliph Uthman (Hz. Osman) to write down the Quran is said to have been fabricated approximately 180 years after the events, during the Abbasid period [00:03:06]. This fabrication likely stemmed from a desire to ease discomfort about the Quran not being written during Muhammad's lifetime or soon after [00:03:18], [00:03:28], [00:03:30]. Narratives about its compilation during Uthman's time gained prominence in the Abbasid era [00:03:36], [00:03:48].

Scientific and objective information suggests that the Quran was compiled around 680 CE during the Umayyad period [00:03:57], [00:04:06]. Before this compilation, the transmission of the Quranic text was primarily oral, akin to the [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Syriac tradition]] and [[comparison_of_religious_texts_and_influences_between_islamic_and_preislamic_traditions | Jewish tradition]] of transmitting divine messages [00:04:10], [00:04:12], [00:04:15], [00:04:16]. People memorized and recited these texts in mosques [00:04:22]. However, the authenticity of this oral transmission cannot be definitively ascertained [00:04:34].

When the [[compilation_of_the_quran_after_muhammad | compilation of the Quran after Muhammad]] began, there were different textual traditions in various cities and regions, including Yemen, Damascus, and Kufa [00:04:44], [00:04:48], [00:04:51]. These differing traditions, where individuals claimed to know verses differently, were suppressed by order of Hajjaj [00:04:57], [00:05:01]. Consequently, a single text was created that aligned with the [[influence_of_political_power_on_quranic_text | political interests of the Umayyad State]] [00:05:13]. This codification occurred approximately 50 to 60 years after the death of Prophet Muhammad [00:05:21]. This process represents a significant stage in [[the_evolution_and_interpretation_of_religious_texts | the evolution and interpretation of religious texts]].

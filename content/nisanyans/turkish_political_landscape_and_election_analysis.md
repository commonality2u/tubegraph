## May 29th Election Context
May 29th marked the 570th anniversary of the capture of Istanbul by the Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This historical event is considered a turning point in history, a rare incident where a city's identity was completely transformed by a conquering society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Examples of such identity changes in cities are scarce globally, with few parallels outside of Anatolian cities in [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] and potentially Kazan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The transformation of Istanbul involved a complete cultural and psychological infrastructure change, a process spanning several centuries until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Two main questions emerge from this historical event:
1.  Why did Byzantium lose Istanbul? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> Byzantium was a huge state and empire, yet its self-sustaining process broke down, rendering it unable to finance its wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
2.  Could the outcome have been otherwise in 1452? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> While a static position for Istanbul as a city-state akin to Hong Kong might have been debated at the time, the speaker believes the answer is "No" for 1453 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. A new era of centralized, totalitarian political systems began with the Ottoman Empire's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The turning point might have been the Timur wars in 1402, which led to a new approach focused on centralizing tax collection across the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Analysis of the [[election_results_and_political_analysis_in_trkiye | Election Results]]
The speaker saw the Republican People's Party's (CHP) chance of winning the election as zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Republican People's Party (CHP)
The CHP's vote base is described as an "extremely radical thing," almost a "sect," unconditionally loyal and constituting 24-25% of the population in [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Its ability to expand beyond this base is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. To do so, the party would need a radical change, including potentially its name, symbols, and history, similar to changes seen in European socialist and communist parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Historically, since 2007-2008, the CHP's vote share has fluctuated between 22% and 25.5%, staying within 24-25% for the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. In this election, it achieved 25% to 25.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

For the CHP to change this pattern, it either needs to cease being the CHP or a leader must emerge who can instill great hope and excitement in society, similar to Bülent Ecevit in 1973-1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Kılıçdaroğlu's Leadership
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu is described as having "extremely limited abilities" and being "ridiculous in terms of political skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Given the CHP's rigid identity and a politically weak leader, the party had no chance of winning the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The speaker also believes that a change of power through elections in [[Turkish political developments and changes in government | Turkey]] is technically impossible due to the current government's control over state organs, including the Supreme Election Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

The "pumping up operation" surrounding the election in the last couple of years was found "ridiculous" and those who believed in it "naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

### Voter Behavior and Society
Two common arguments regarding the election results are:
1.  [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkey]] is 60-70% conservative, and they will always vote for the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
2.  A segment of the population votes for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan unconditionally out of loyalty and love, regardless of his actions or mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

The speaker finds these arguments "terribly wrong" and indicative of "mental stagnation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. In elections, people overwhelmingly cast positive votes for a candidate, or negative votes against an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. People vote not necessarily because they are conservative, stupid, or loyal, but because they dislike the alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

[[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkish society]] is described as "extremely opportunist, self-interested," prioritizing personal interests, and suspicious of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. While Islam is an important cultural entity, the majority of [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkish society]] is suspicious of religious figures and does not take them seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The idea of unconditional loyalty is dismissed, as people would sell out their leaders if their interests required it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

The arguments about voters being loyal, conservative, stupid, or ignorant merely reflect the ignorance of those making such arguments, often the "educated people" in [[Social and political dynamics in Trkiye | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The fact that non-CHP parties have consistently received 60-70% of votes since 1960 indicates a consistent rejection of the CHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

The speaker attributes the CHP's inability to gain more than 20% of the vote since 1960 primarily to the "betrayal of 1960," referring to the military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. After this event, trust in the CHP was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The party's performance in the decade following 1960 is seen as "political suicide" due to its arrogance and dishonesty, believing "the Country is Ours" and power is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

### YSP's Performance
The YSP's (Green Left Party, successor to HDP) performance was the speaker's biggest disappointment in the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Despite having a strong base, especially in Eastern provinces, and radical policies, the party failed to play a significant role or become a decisive party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. A major mistake was not nominating a strong candidate from the beginning and instead aligning with a party and candidate (Kılıçdaroğlu) that was clearly going to be defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

The YSP's election campaign was criticized for its "incredibleness" and "horrific inexperience and incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. The deal with Ümit Özdağ, seen as a "caricature of Fascism," was particularly condemned for alienating Kurdish voters by bringing up the issue of trustees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. This move, which would cost at least 10% of votes, is seen as either "class stupidity" or a calculated "election engineering" to lose the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook for [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]]
The speaker advises young people against migrating to America, England, or Germany, as these places are "rapidly drifting towards disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Instead, he suggests staying in [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] and engaging with the local population outside of major cities, noting that the country's rural and traditional people hold centuries of accumulated wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

A key takeaway is that democracy is unlikely to come to [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. The focus should be on how to live and fulfill social responsibilities despite this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

### Economic and Political Stability
[[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] is expected to face serious economic collapse, potentially mirroring the situations in Lebanon and Sri Lanka, with banks and the Central Bank reaching bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. However, the country can overcome this if it avoids being dragged into war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. Therefore, when evaluating political messages, one should always ask if they lead the country closer to or further away from war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

An economic collapse is unlikely to change the government; on the contrary, it may strengthen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. The speaker argues that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is "doomed to power until he dies" or leaves due to a coup, as a peaceful transition or an anointing of a successor seems improbable given his actions and the potential for a "wave of revenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>.

### Perceived "Iranianization" of [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]]
Regarding the term "Iranianization" of [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]], the speaker states that Iran is not a bad country, despite some "annoying and absurd ideological obsessions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. He believes that if [[Electoral outcomes and their impact on Turkey | Turkey]] were to become like Iran, "nothing bad will happen" in terms of peace and living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

The intense rhetoric from the government, including insults and threats against half of society, is seen as a "very ugly policy" that condemns the country to psychological and moral destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. This constant verbal assault, exemplified by increased megaphone volume for calls to prayer, creates alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

## Global Geopolitical Context
"Very terrible things are happening in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Ukraine is considered defeated, its army exhausted as a fighting force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. A definite and strong Russian victory in Ukraine would lead to a world war because NATO cannot accept such a defeat, as it would signify the end of NATO and America's world hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

The speaker suggests that Russia might be offering a deal where Western Ukraine is given to Poland, while other parts go to Hungary or Romania, with the rest potentially joining Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This could be a strategic move to break NATO's resolve, leveraging Poland's historical dream of acquiring Western Ukrainian lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

Other potential flashpoints for escalating conflict include:
*   Tensions between Kosovo and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   The three Baltic republics bordering Finland and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.
*   An impending Iran war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.

The American government's recent decision to allow unlimited borrowing until January 1, 2025, is seen as a policy of "sinking with fireworks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This unlimited borrowing implies unlimited money printing, a desperate measure indicating deep-seated issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

The safest places in the event of a world war are predicted to be China, Central Asia, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

## Global Governance
The world, particularly the Western world, is governed by a combination of intelligence organizations (like the CIA) and large financial institutions (investment funds, pharmaceutical industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. These entities, intertwined with big technology companies that control information flow, have amassed unprecedented power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. They rule where they can and declare war where they cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. This governance is not by secret committees or groups like the Illuminati, but by official institutions and legally established companies that have "messed up and ruined it" because "they are not as smart as they think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

The discourse surrounding **contemporary Turkish politics** often involves examining the legacy of figures like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the influence of Islam on state ideology. A key perspective suggests that political leaders, regardless of their era, operate under fundamental principles: to re-establish a collapsed state's power and to protect their own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Historical Context and State Building

In the early 20th century, the modernization struggle, which the Ottomans failed at for a century, aimed to create national excitement, even if it was "fake," in a country where one-third of the population had become immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Elites in Istanbul and Izmir were perceived as lukewarm, while ordinary citizens were swayed by stories of homeland, nation, and triumph against invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This period also saw the continuation of a tradition of intrigue and political terror, inherited from the Union and Progress organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In foreign policy, there was an attempt to strike a middle ground between British liberalism and German Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Questions are raised about whether later actions, such as the theories of language and history, the Dersim massacre, the liquidation of İnönü, the purchase of the Savarona yacht, and the decision to live in Dolmabahçe Palace, were signs of "madness" or the corrupting effect of absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The speaker argues that it is difficult to protect oneself from the corrupting effect of absolute power, and those who claim they can are "lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Comparing Mustafa Kemal to Abdülhamid, it's noted that both faced similar challenges of leading an exhausted state and protecting their power and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It is suggested that criticizing historical figures from a distance is easy, but escaping the "frame" drawn by fate is difficult, perhaps impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Governing a state is described as more of a science than an art, with objective laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even with radical dreams, power has a logic that must be adhered to, or one risks being erased from history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Critique of Kemalism and Nationalism

The article asserts that engaging in historical debates with figures like Mustafa Kemal, who died 80 years ago, is unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Current problems are not from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The use of "sacred holy sisters of the rope" (icons) in Orthodox churches as a symbol of [[contemporary_political_landscape_in_trkiye | contemporary Turkish racism]] and state gatekeeping is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This symbolizes a "moral blindness" that justifies all dishonesty in the name of the state, homeland, and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The phrase "If the issue is homeland, the rest is details" embodies this sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

[[Influence of nationalism in Turkish politics | Nationalism]] is portrayed as a tool of populism worldwide that glorifies a people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Those who use demagogy to provoke are typically called nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Nationalism is described as a "pathology" and a "strange sub-elite culture that hates its own society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The Kemalist sect is criticized for rejecting Islam's words and presenting itself as an alternative to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This sect's "Hakime arrogance" (arrogance of power/rule) is seen as a barrier to understanding the rights of Turks and establishing emotional closeness with them, especially concerning the Kurdish issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This prevents them from comprehending Türkiye's modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Mustafa Kemal's Role and Legacy

Mustafa Kemal is acknowledged as having a significant, undeniable share in making arrogance and insult the main axis of Turkish political language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. His "real crime," however, is deemed indirect, as Kemalism, particularly after the 1960 coup, became a "cancer" built with the cooperation of two parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

To de-sacralize Mustafa Kemal, it's proposed that he should be viewed not as an epic hero but as an ordinary political leader whose actions can be discussed based on reason and benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The book "Wrong Republic" (Yanlış Cumhuriyet) is mentioned as an example of questioning historical narratives without disparagement, merely asking for different perspectives and logical scrutiny of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Mustafa Kemal had two clear goals: to save and rebuild the collapsed state, and to protect his own power and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. He was successful in the first goal, as he remained in power until his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. However, the radical transformation needed to make the system he established permanent in the long term was not provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. The project of raising the country to the level of leading world countries was a "complete fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The secular decline that began in the Ottoman Empire in the 1600s continued into the Republic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

A "disgusting attitude" is observed in Türkiye's government offices, where symbols of a religious ceremony (icons) are displayed, and an icon representing the state is used to justify abandoning normal human logic and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

The İzmir assassination plot of 1926 is discussed as a potential excuse to intimidate the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. It's noted that at every stage of a dictator's life, there is likely an "assassination college" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This event was used to purge old Iddaa Terakki (Union and Progress) cadres who were close to Mustafa Kemal, including those who financed the National Struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. All seven people who signed the Amasya declaration with Mustafa Kemal were tried with the death penalty, a "purge movement" similar to those initiated by Stalin in the Soviet Union or the "Night of the Long Knives" in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. This highlights that the cadres who make a revolution often differ from those who govern, leading to bloody fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## Contemporary Turkish Politics and Future Outlook

The possibility of a "new and democratic Kemalism" is dismissed as a "complete dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Young secular academics who propose this have lost touch with the country and deeply hate the majority of the population, rendering them incapable of political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. An ideology rooted in a "totalitarian dictator of the 1930s" cannot become a more democratic symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

The idea that Türkiye would have been "destroyed" without Mustafa Kemal is challenged; people would still be living there, and the country would have become "another state" if not the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. The "nationalization" or new identity synthesis of the Turkish nation was a difficult process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. The argument is made that if someone else had been in Mustafa Kemal's place in 1919 or 1923, similar events would have unfolded, as the logic of state building and power protection dictates certain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

The traditional Ottoman administration is considered to have effectively ended around 1908-1909 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Abdülhamid's reign is likened to a "plug" that stopped a stream, leaving almost no continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. The prominent cadres in 1908 were too young to remember the past and lacked respect for institutions, including the Sultanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

Türkiye is not isolated from global events; the dissolution of empires (Russian Tsardom, Austria-Hungary, German, Iranian dynasties) after World War I affected its trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Türkiye has historically been the "most open face of the Islamic world to the West," adopting Western innovations like the printing press, telescope, new military organization, and paper money before other Islamic regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Until just before the Republic period, 25% of Türkiye's population and over 30% of its economic structure were non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

The speaker believes that a return to Kemalist culture is a "very, very distant possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Instead, there is a current search for a new route, staffing, and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The process of adopting Islam as the official state ideology in Türkiye is not easily reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

## Islamic Influence and Future Ideals

Existing ideals and models have been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. The globalist capitalist American model championed by Turgut Özal did not suit Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. The Westernization project, pursued under the guise of the European Union until 2011, also faltered as the EU itself showed signs of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

In the absence of alternatives, Islam has emerged as an idea that unites and defines the country, providing a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. This helplessness and lack of alternatives continue today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. The developed Western world is rapidly heading towards an "explosion" due to inadequate existing thought systems, political parties, and institutional structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. People are dissatisfied with existing political alternatives and are looking for a new "revolution," a glimmer of hope that promises a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

This need for a new hope is also valid for Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. Across the Islamic world, from Iran to Indonesia, there is a widespread belief that the solution lies in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

One notable example of corruption in modern Turkish history is the Savarona yacht incident, which was used by Atatürk during his illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. The speaker describes it as one of the "most despicable and most pathetic corruption incidents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>, born from the "boss's megalomania" and leading to a chain of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. The yacht, after Atatürk's death, fell into disuse and was even reportedly turned into a "brothel for upper-class customers" before being repurposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

It is asserted that there has never been a popular Islamic fanaticism or dominant political view in Türkiye, as the country has a state tradition, inherited from Byzantium, of having a ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. Since the 1830s, this ruling class has unanimously chosen Western Europe as its reference point and model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

The speaker concludes by advising against underestimating Afghanistan, describing it as an "unfortunate country" that has suffered heavy blows and been "ruined" and "taken back to the Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

The ongoing situation in [[israelpalestine_conflict_and_implications | Palestine]], particularly in Gaza, is characterized as a terrible massacre and a clearly declared genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>. Gaza is described as a very crowded, densely populated concentration camp where over 2 million people live under heavy pressure, unable to move more than 100-200 meters from the sea, and cut off from the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>. The [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | State of Israel]] is mercilessly bombing this concentration camp, including its institutions, schools, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a>. The explicit purpose of these actions is for the people to give up and flee to Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>. Simultaneously, or immediately after, an ethnic cleansing movement was started or will be started in the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>. This constitutes the most terrible humanitarian disaster of recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>.

## Global Reaction and Moral Stance

Individuals with any sense of conscience or morality are disgusted by these actions, viewing opposition to them as a basic requirement of being human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>. The global anger and hatred stirred by these events are so fierce and overwhelming that the speaker doubts the [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | State of Israel]] can cope with this disaster in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39">[03:39]</a>. Bloody events are occurring, and equally bloody retaliatory incidents are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>.

Western countries, which currently provide 10,000% support and encouragement to [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]], are unlikely to maintain this determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. Globally, including the Islamic world, Africa, Latin America, [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]], and [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | China]], there is near-unanimous hatred for this massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. Notably, public opinion within Western countries has taken a stance against their governments' stated policies at an unprecedented rate in recent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>. In what is perceived as panic behavior, countries like England, France, and Germany have banned pro-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]] demonstrations, threatening arrest, punishment, deportation, and even deprivation of basic citizenship rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52">[05:52]</a>. Despite these bans, hundreds of thousands of people in these countries are protesting, challenging the state and police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12">[06:12]</a>. Social media worldwide has overwhelmingly favored [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]], with pro-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Palestinian]] messages calculated to be 15 times more prevalent than pro-Israeli ones on platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26">[06:26]</a>.

### Western Support for Israel

The speaker questions whether Western states are incompetent or if irrationalism guides their administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>. A deeper question arises regarding why Western states have taken such a determined and uncompromising side with [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] since 1917 or 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>. It is debated whether this stance is taken willingly or under some obligations, and if they have attempted to rid themselves of such obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>.

## Role of Middle Eastern States

[[historical_relations_between_iran_and_israel | Arab states]] and [[historical_relations_between_iran_and_israel | Iran]] have responded to the incident with a "sloppy attitude," offering verbal condemnations but practically doing whatever [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | America]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01">[10:01]</a>. This situation is expected to change due to overwhelming public pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27">[10:27]</a>. While Iran has not yet acted decisively, it is predicted they will not be able to stay out of the war even if they want to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:07">[0:29:07]</a>. The expectation is that they will wait for Gaza to be leveled and global hatred to peak before intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:24">[0:29:24]</a>.

## Debating the Nature of the Conflict

A common argument suggests that pro-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]] perspectives in the Islamic world, especially in TÃ¼rkiye, are rooted in primitive anti-Semitism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29">[12:29]</a>. While anti-Semitism may exist, the speaker emphasizes that the core issue is an unbearable incident of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>. This oppression is not limited to recent bombings but has been ongoing since 1948, involving forced confiscation of lands, expulsion of a large population, and condemnation to life in concentration/refugee camps under miserable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14">[13:14]</a>. Daily humiliations, bans, and deprivation of basic human and citizen rights are also part of this oppression, which should be acknowledged regardless of religious affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>. Many people worldwide, including countless Jews and millions in the Western world with no connection to Islam, share this common human feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a>.

### Land Claims and Colonialism

Arguments that the occupation of land is the main issue, or claims based on 2000-year-old rights or religious texts, are dismissed as absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>. The establishment of [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] is framed as a colonial act, with England's backing, where new settlers "collapsed on a land that belonged to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26">[15:26]</a>. This "invasion" or "conquest" is not unique to [[middle_east_conflicts_and_ceasefire_in_israel | Israel]]-[[middle_east_conflicts_and_ceasefire_in_israel | Palestine]], as similar historical patterns are seen in the foundation of Turkey, America, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a>. While recognizing such acts as sad and cruel, a "mature person" understands that history is full of such cases and seeks ways to "save the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33">[16:33]</a>.

The speaker admits to always knowing [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] unjustly conquered the land, considering it a crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11">[17:11]</a>. However, until recent years, they viewed [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] with sympathy, believing that if a civilization created a "beauty" that honored humanity, the crime could be forgiven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26">[17:26]</a>. In its early years, [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] offered such hope as a "valuable, civilized country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22">[18:22]</a>. Unfortunately, for the last 20 years, especially since Netanyahu and his "gang" came to power, [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] has become "the prisoner of a culture full of incredible hatred" and believes oppression is its right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41">[18:41]</a>. While acknowledging a country under threat of extinction might not have the luxury of being "soft," the speaker questions how long a country can exist solely through continuous oppression, and whether such a country has the right to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35">[19:35]</a>.

### Islamist vs. Universal Cause

Responding to the argument that the Palestinian cause is merely another Islamist cause, the speaker makes two distinctions:
1.  While exploited by Islamists, the Palestinian cause is not *only* their cause; it is a cause for all humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33">[20:33]</a>.
2.  The opposing force, the [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | State of Israel]] and its society, despite appearing modern, is described as being "as bigoted as the bearded, skullcap-wearing and Islamist group," or even more so, having "lost its moral anchor" and being "drunk with oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45">[20:45]</a>. The choice between them is simple: there are bad and victimized people on one side, and bad people on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27">[21:27]</a>.

### Combating Islamist Fanaticism

The claim that [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] is uniquely capable of fighting Islamist savagery is refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43">[21:43]</a>. [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] and [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | China]] are presented as successful examples in combating Islamist extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56">[21:56]</a>. [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] has no serious Islamist movement because its Muslim populations (e.g., Tatars, Dagestan, Chechens) do not need it and are aware it is "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10">[22:10]</a>. [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | China]] has shown "extraordinary success" in dealing with the Uyghur terrorism movement through economic development, education, flexibility, and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21">[23:21]</a>. Weaker examples include Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain, where Islamic fanaticism is less prevalent despite nominally preserving Islamic principles, while creating modern and developed societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00">[24:00]</a>.

### Right to Exist

The speaker questions why a "tiny Jewish Israeli state" should not be granted the right to live in the vast geography of Muslim Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51">[24:51]</a>. However, they argue that the answer to why that tiny piece of land should not be exclusively Arab/Muslim is simple: "there were people sitting here and there is no reasonable reason for these people to be expelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30">[25:30]</a>. If expulsion were justifiable, the same argument could be applied to Israeli Jews, suggesting they could go to other Western countries like the United States, Canada, or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40">[25:40]</a>.

The speaker also addresses the historical conquests by Arabs in the Middle East, stating that their "Islamization" was a form of "conquest" or "colonization," similar to what [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | Israel]] did in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46">[26:46]</a>. While admitting they would have opposed the Islamic invasion in the past, they assert that "past oppressions do not excuse today's oppressions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14">[27:14]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Context

The [[middle_east_political_tensions_and_scenarios | real war]] is not the [[israelpalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]]-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]] War or the Iran-America War, but the global hegemony war waged by [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | America]] and its allies against the worldwide hegemony led by [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] and [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44">[30:44]</a>.

The [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_israelgaza_conflict | Ukraine War]] is "quietly approaching its end," with Western alliance managers giving ultimatums to Ukraine's leadership, indicating the war is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17">[31:17]</a>. Russia is expected to be unwilling to accept a ceasefire or peace offer, and the outcome is likely to be Ukraine's defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27">[32:27]</a>. The prevailing idea in [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] might be to eliminate the Ukrainian state, as it is considered a historical part of [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08">[33:08]</a>. A more realistic option is the separation of four provinces from Ukraine (excluding Crimea), cutting Ukraine's connection to the sea, ensuring its military disarmament, and establishing a new regime under Russian auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54">[33:54]</a>. Another Russian demand is anticipated to be the demilitarization of the three Baltic Republics, requiring the withdrawal of [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | NATO]] military units and facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46">[34:46]</a>. This is seen as a necessary correction to their hostile stance encouraged by the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55">[36:55]</a>.

The North Atlantic [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | NATO]] alliance's continued existence after the Ukraine fiasco is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38">[37:38]</a>. Notably, [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | NATO]] has been largely silent in the current [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Israel]]-[[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]] incident, with America and England acting independently, possibly to avoid a Turkish veto on [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | NATO]] decisions given Turkey's contradictory stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04">[38:04]</a>.

## Future of Global Hegemony

The speaker believes that if [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | America]] is defeated and [[united_states_and_israels_strategy_in_the_middle_east | NATO]] disintegrates, the world will soon necessitate a fight against rising powers like [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | China]] and [[analysis_of_the_israelpalestine_conflict_and_its_potential_resolutions | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:19">[0:01:19]</a>. The "great revolution" has begun in Ukraine and may continue in [[israelipalestinian_conflict_and_war_legitimacy_debate | Palestine]], [[historical_relations_between_iran_and_israel | Iran]], and similar places, aiming to break the central control mechanism of American hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. This breaking of power cannot be achieved through demonstrations or political parties but through war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

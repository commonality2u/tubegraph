This article details an extraordinary claim regarding [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]]'s alleged missile program and its controversial transaction with the United States, as presented in the "Houston, We Have a Problem" film.

## The "Houston, We Have a Problem" Narrative

The story of [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]]'s dealings with the United States regarding a missile program is presented as the central theme of a film titled "Houston, We Have a Problem." The speaker describes the film as having a profound effect, creating a feeling of disbelief and intrigue about what truly transpired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It is later clarified that the film is a mockumentary, meaning a fictional documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

## The Alleged Missile Program Sale

According to the narrative, [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]]'s greatest feat was selling a missile program to the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This event is said to have occurred in the early 1960s when the Americans were experiencing successive failures in their own efforts to send missiles into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. At the time, [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] was rumored to possess a very serious missile program, capable of launching new types of missiles into or close to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The Americans, recognizing their lack of technology and [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]]'s financial constraints, sent high-level diplomats to negotiate the sale of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. After intense bargaining, [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]] allegedly sold the missile program to the Americans for 3 billion dollars, a sum equivalent to 50 billion dollars in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### The Deception

The crucial twist in the story is that the program sold by [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] was entirely fake and non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The Americans spent two to three years attempting to get results from the purchased program, ultimately without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. They accused [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]] of ripping them off and demanded their money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Political Aftermath

This incident became the main point of conflict between America and [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

*   **Kennedy's Threats:** President Kennedy reportedly summoned [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]] to New York and made threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Coincidentally, during his time in New York, an assassination attempt on [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]] occurred, carried out by [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslav]] opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Failed Technical Support:** Despite [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Tito]]'s insistence that their engineers were not capable, a team of [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslav]] engineers was sent to America, but they still could not yield any results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Consequently, NASA or the relevant American team had to abandon the [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslav]] project and start their own work from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Nixon's Retaliation:** The conflict escalated further with President Nixon threatening to bomb [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Blueprint programs for the division of [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] were reportedly prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As a show of intimidation, six of the largest [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavian]] embassies and consulates in America were bombed within an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **The "Yugo" Offering:** In response to demands for repayment, the [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavs]] offered "Yugo" automobiles, claiming them to be cheap and amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This was seen as a mockery by the Americans, who rejected the cars as "garbage," leading to further anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

This entire saga is described as a "gangsterism and banditry story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, where [[yugoslavias_political_history_and_legacy | Yugoslavia]] successfully "scammed America" out of an equivalent of 50 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s past, particularly concerning the Tanzimat era, is often discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. There is a contrast between modern perceptions of the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] and its historical reality, especially evident in television series portraying a "strange militarist aggressive conquest" and a "religious common people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Understanding the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] in the 19th century, or even the 17th-18th centuries, reveals a very different world from these depictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Periods of the Ottoman Empire

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s history can be broadly divided into three distinct periods, each with characteristics not entirely similar to the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### The Establishment Period (Early 1500s)

This period saw the establishment of an empire with "incredible speed" and "Dino face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The Ottomans introduced a new type of Islamic Empire, extraordinarily successful for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The empire, which stretched from Vienna to Basra and south of Egypt, was built on "extremely strong central control," with the economy largely under state control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This model was considered "extremely rational within the framework of its own assumptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The Ottomans learned from the "failed examples" of the Abbasid State and the Byzantine Empire, trying to "purify themselves from their mistakes" and establish a new type of empire systematically and rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Period of Decline and Destruction (Mid-16th Century to Early 20th Century)

While initially successful, this rational model "almost brought a great collapse with an inevitable logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. From the 16th century, the global trade direction changed, Europe gained technological and economic strength, and its population increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The Ottoman model, similar to the Soviet model, was "very central and very fragile," leading to its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s decline is described as "one of the longest and most painful destruction stories in the history of the world," lasting from the 1570s/1580s until 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The process of destruction led to Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean basin (Syria, Anatolia, Balkans) turning into a "Stone Age" equivalent, becoming one of the world's poorest regions with low literacy and high unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The production system, like the timar system, collapsed around 1500-1590, leading to villagers escaping or becoming nomads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Large migrations of plunderers from the Middle East to Anatolia further destabilized the region, causing towns to lose population, the economy to collapse, and luxury production to cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. By the 18th century, European travelers noted that crossing into Ottoman lands meant entering an area of "isolation, abandonment, destruction and poverty, civilization has ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the early 1500s, when Anatolia and Rumelia were among the richest and most urbanized regions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Ottoman Decline

Unlike other regions like India or China that suffered from European imperial robbery, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s decline was largely self-inflicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While Europe made significant advancements in industrial production from the 18th century due to centuries of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s internal production and management models collapsed, leading to severe impoverishment compared to its own past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

The state actively suppressed any organization or structure outside its control, leading to a lack of social infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. By the 18th century, local "feudal lords" emerged across Anatolia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, and Bulgaria, establishing independent or semi-independent principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. These rulers, like Cin Ali Pasha in Egypt, Kozanoğlu in Adana, Karaosmanoğlu in Bergama, and Tepedelenli Ali Pasha in the Balkans, effectively governed their regions, sometimes even conducting their own foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The opulent İshak Paşa Palace in Doğubeyazıt is seen as a symbolic challenge to both Ottoman and Iranian imperial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

The [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]]'s downfall is largely attributed to its extreme "surplus value exploitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Initially, this led to massive wealth and grand projects like mosques and palaces, admired globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. However, over-exploitation eventually led to the impoverishment of the populace, leading to peasant revolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This unsustainable model crippled the state's ability to innovate or maintain a strong central culture, leaving it vulnerable to stronger states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

## Ottoman Modernization and Westernization Efforts

By the early 1800s, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] was facing complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This led to a period of reform, starting during the reign of Selim III and continuing under Mahmud II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The reforms aimed to re-establish the state using Europe as the model for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This meant adopting European consultants, uniforms, languages, and applying European methods in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

Despite the radical nature of these [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization and westernization]] reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, they largely failed to achieve their desired goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The reforms were confined to a narrow elite circle in Istanbul, primarily within the Bosphorus, Beyoğlu, and Eminönü areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. While significant changes occurred within this elite, they failed to permeate broadly to the provinces, leading to "uncalculated and unforeseen disasters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Comparison with other Empires

The [[ottoman_modernization_and_westernization | Ottoman modernization and westernization]] efforts are often compared to those of Japan and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Japan succeeded due to its extremely homogeneous society, which could be considered as belonging to the same culture, ideal, state, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Russia, while an empire, also managed to forge a homogeneous culture by forcing a single common ideal and lifestyle across its diverse tribal populations, even if it later faced challenges in maintaining this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

In contrast, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] was a "union established by conquest" and tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The various communities under Ottoman rule resisted losing their national or religious identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. As a result, the [[history_and_impact_of_the_ottoman_empire | Ottoman Empire]] "could never become a nation" or a homogeneous social entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. When the political structure began to be questioned, various groups sought their own political formations, exemplified by [[historical_conflicts_and_events_in_the_ottoman_empire_and_greece | Greek independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Sociocultural Aspects and Elite Mentality

The [[cultural_and_social_dynamics_in_the_late_ottoman_period | Ottoman culture]] itself, particularly the elite, underwent a significant shift. In the 15th-16th centuries, the Ottoman elite was dynamic and focused on exploiting surplus value for grand projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. However, a "conservative and emotional" societal shift occurred, especially from the 1550s during the last years of Kanuni's reign and deepening into the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. This conservatism stemmed from an economic blockage, leading to fierce internal struggles among the elite as the "pie to be shared was shrinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

The cessation of the conquest and plunder process, which was the [[historical_account_of_the_ottoman_empire_and_its_legacy | Ottoman Empire]]'s basic economic mechanism, weakened its foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. This led to internal conflicts and the collapse of the central dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

During the Tulip Period (early 18th century) and onwards, the Ottoman elite developed a mindset of "getting rich" and preserving their refined life within a narrow Istanbul circle, rather than reforming the collapsing state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This led to a deepening cultural gap between the elite and the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

The ruling class was hesitant to shake the established system because the empire's majority population was non-Muslim (Greek, Slav, Armenian, Assyrian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. The state's authority rested on conquest, where the Muslim minority was the sole ruler, excluding others from military and administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Any attempt to reform this could lead to the "physical destruction" of the Muslim minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

Despite the empire's diverse population, there was a functional intertwining and a "common management understanding" within the region, where people of different religions (Armenians, Greeks, Georgians, Turks) were employed together for state projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. However, this did not translate into a unified national identity.

The elite's cultural world was increasingly narrow and insular, characterized by "cultural acrobatics" within a very small circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. This insular mindset, for instance, explained the late adoption of the printing press; its purpose was not for mass literacy, but to serve the elite's desire for selective knowledge and to maintain control over information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

The [[historical_reflections_on_ottoman_empires_reforms_and_leadership | Ottoman reforms]] were ultimately a "dead end," either lacking sufficient bravery or being constrained by insurmountable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. The established structure was so deeply intertwined that removing a few elements could cause a complete collapse, which eventually happened in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. The consequences of this historical trajectory continue to affect Turkey today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Once one of the world's richest and most cultured countries, Turkey has become a "misery and a garbage dump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

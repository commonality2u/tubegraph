The speaker begins by noting the sudden arrival of autumn in [[living_in_montenegro | Montenegro]], experiencing a rainy September day after suffocating heat just two weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Flights to Istanbul are mentioned as coinciding with the "summer of PastÄ±rma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Organized Tours to Georgia and Armenia

A [[planning_and_details_of_a_group_tour_to_georgia_and_armenia | Georgia-Armenia tour]] was organized to start on October 11th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This tour attracted significant interest, with its 40-person quota filling up in just a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Due to continued demand, a second tour was announced to start on the 20th, with a few places still available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The speaker particularly encourages young individuals to join, emphasizing that it will be a "very nice tour" that is fun, informative, and "horizon expanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

During the trip, the quality of conversation increases, and participants tend to get along well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Highlights of Georgia and Armenia

Both Georgia and Armenia are highlighted as countries "worth seeing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

*   **Tbilisi:** Described as "one of the most beautiful cities in the world," possessing a blend of [[travel_experiences_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | European and Middle Eastern features]] and a rich cultural and natural texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Yerevan:** Offers a "completely different taste" with very nice restaurants, making it a beautiful country and city in terms of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The tours are designed to visit "very striking places that not every tourist sees," as the organizers and accompanying friends know both countries quite well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The speaker urges listeners not to miss this opportunity, stating that they "won't do it again Georgia Armenia" for future tours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. There's a lighthearted mention that for the next trip, Ms. Ira might "protest strongly" against a destination like Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

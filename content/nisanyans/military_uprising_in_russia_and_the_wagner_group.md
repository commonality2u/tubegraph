The military uprising in Russia captivated the international press and public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Upon its commencement, the speaker received numerous messages expressing concern and criticism regarding their previous assessment of [[russia_and_western_society_comparison | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The speaker's initial opinion was that the incident would last 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, a prediction they shared on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, the event concluded in 22 hours, making the 48-hour estimate "very pessimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Historical Context and Nature of Uprisings
The speaker's 48-hour estimate stemmed from historical precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. History contains "a thousand and one things about mercenary uprisings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, particularly during wartime when emotions and personality clashes are heightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Such uprisings have occurred in various contexts, including the Ottoman Empire, Ancient Rome, Kurdish principalities, and both World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Ninety-nine percent of these uprisings are suppressed within 40 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## The Wagner Group
The Wagner group is described as a force of "20,000-something people prepared for small-scale wars, a guerrilla type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Its manpower is considered one-eighth of the total personnel of the Carrefour group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Crucially, the group lacks its own Air Force, logistics resources, factories, weapons resources, weapons production, and an Intelligence Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## State of Russia and Societal Reaction
[[russias_role_in_international_relations_and_conflicts | Russia]] has been transitioning from a state where regions were controlled by separate mafias and opportunities for young people were limited to becoming "Natasha" or an alcoholic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Despite its problems like bureaucratic blockage and income inequality, the country is seen as more successful than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The president generally enjoys societal acceptance and appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, viewed as someone who "saved the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

In such a country, a challenge to the state by a [[military_discipline_and_political_involvement | military commander]] in the middle of a war is "strongly rejected and cursed by the overwhelming majority of the society and the circles that hold the power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, and those who attempt it are typically "hanged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Western Press and Propaganda
The speaker criticized the performance of the [[western_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | Western press]] and its local branches regarding the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, describing it as a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> and lacking "minimum intelligence and knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Dominant discourse included predictions of civil war, widespread bloodshed, and [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukraine's definitive victory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This was characterized as a "Symphony of Fools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. More sensible interpretations included theories of a "double game," deception, or conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Explanation of the Uprising
A simpler explanation for the uprising is the presence of "vodka in this business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, given the prevalence of heavy drinking in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

The leader of the Wagner group, described as an "adventurous man, a thug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> who started from selling sausage sandwiches and became close to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, shared a "very close father-son relationship" with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The uprising occurred because of a decision to "liquidate the Wagner group" as of July 1, connecting all its members to the Ministry of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Feeling a conspiracy against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> and believing the Minister of Defense was a "stupid bureaucrat" who prolonged the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, the leader, possibly under the influence of alcohol, decided to confront the "boss" directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. His friends tried to dissuade him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This behavior is typical of warlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> and historical figures like rebellious pashas in the Ottoman Empire who sought to address the sultan directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Putin's Response
Putin appeared on screen the next day and delivered a "very good speech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. He declared the uprising "treason" and stated that those involved "will be executed," with all necessary orders given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This was a "shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. From Putin's perspective, not condemning the action would have shown great weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. He made a "very smart move" by activating "the dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, essentially warning the leader to "come to your senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Outcome and Implications
The rebellion concluded in 22 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Its outcome "resulted in the consolidation and strengthening of the Putin regime in every way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. While some of the leader's criticisms and objections were legitimate and shared by a large part of Russian society, the consensus was that it was "time for war" and not for personal complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. All [[military_discipline_and_political_involvement | military personnel]], civil administration, and opposition parties, with the exception of the leader, lined up behind Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Putin demonstrated his determination and composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

The reason the uprising was "allowed to go and demonstrate for 24 hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> was because preventing it would have required "shedding a lot of blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> against experienced warriors who were considered national heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Putin likely knew it would resolve itself within 24 hours, viewing the leader as "emotional and a little stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Comparison to the 1917 Kornilov Affair
The incident is compared to the Kornilov Affair in July 1917, during the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. After a provisional government was established and Russia was struggling in war, Bolshevik propaganda caused the army to disperse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. General Kornilov then moved army units towards Petersburg (the capital at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, ostensibly to support the government or take military control, believing the central administration was failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Kerensky's government ordered them to return, but they did not obey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. When a general arrived in Petersburg, he was detained, and the incident became a "Persian comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Vladimir Lenin made a "genius political move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> by having the Bolshevik Party, which was previously banned, declare full support for the timber government against the military threat posed by Kornilov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This allowed Lenin to gain power, and shortly after, the Bolsheviks liquidated the government with a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The speaker suggests Putin implicitly referenced this incident, meaning "it will not be like in 1917" this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Broader Context of the Ukraine War
The speaker reiterates a firm belief that [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_geopolitical_dynamics | Russia]] will win the [[russian_ukraine_conflict_and_its_implications | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. While initially thinking Russia would be defeated economically, this did not happen; instead, Russia "got stronger in the last year and a half" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. [[western_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | Western countries]], conversely, "came to their bankruptcy" by following "stupid series of policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

After Istanbul talks were disrupted by "the force of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, Russia changed its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The initial idea of a quick operation to destroy the Ukrainian army and secure neutrality for two provinces ended in March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Since then, the goal has been to "destroy the state called Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a> by consuming it, bringing it to a point where it cannot continue its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The speaker anticipates that Western Ukraine's fate is uncertain, but the middle and East will join Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. The Ukrainian armies have collapsed, its industrial and financial infrastructure destroyed, and a generation of its male population eradicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. The elimination of the Ukrainian regime is seen as a "service to humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

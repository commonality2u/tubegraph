## Introduction
The current geopolitical landscape in Europe is characterized by intricate dynamics, historical rivalries, and potential realignments, particularly concerning the relationships between Germany, Russia, and Poland, and the broader implications for [[current_geopolitical_tensions_involving_nato_and_russia | NATO]].

## Poland's Stance and Historical Precedents
Poland views the [[global_political_dynamics_and_conflicts | Ukrainian War]] as a fundamental issue of its own existence, having supported Ukraine with "heart and soul" and a unanimous, cross-party vote [00:59:36]. This strong stance is rooted in a deep historical fear of a German-Russian rapprochement [01:00:50].

Historically, Poland has suffered greatly from such alliances:
*   **18th Century Partitions**
    *   In the late 18th century (around 1772-1790), Poland's close ties with Prussia (Germany) led to Russia initiating war to "save" Poland from German influence [01:01:11]. This resulted in Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioning Poland entirely, leaving "no Poland behind" [01:02:20].
*   **Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty (1939)**
    *   Despite being "great enemies" and ideologically opposed, Russia and Germany unexpectedly formed an alliance through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty [01:02:58]. A week later, they jointly invaded Poland [01:03:31].

These historical events underscore Poland's strategic reality: it will "fight until the last drop of their blood to prevent a German-Russian rapprochement" [01:05:38]. This imperative stems from its strategic location and past experiences [01:05:49].

## Germany's Geopolitical Posture
For the past two years, Germany has conveyed two primary messages:
1.  **Economic Distress**: A constant "scream" of decline, claiming its industry is "sinking" and everything is "gone" [01:03:48].
2.  **Political Incompetence**: German politicians routinely portray themselves and their leadership as "stupid" and incompetent [01:04:20].

However, this narrative is presented as a form of "propaganda" [01:04:53]. It is suggested that one should be "suspicious" if a country consistently claims to be stupid [01:04:40]. The speaker suggests being "prepared for surprises" regarding Germany's true economic performance and geopolitical intentions [01:05:32].

Other states in Europe must consider the "extremely high" possibility of Germany "stirring up something underhandedly" and "making a counterattack in any case" [01:00:03].

## Russia's Strategic Objectives
Russia's primary strategic goal is the disintegration of [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]], which it views as a "deadly danger" and a "threat" [01:13:35]. To achieve this, Russia is willing to make concessions, offering cheap resources like oil, natural gas, nickel, and lithium, and purchasing products from Germany's automotive industry [01:14:02].

Russia's recent strategic successes include:
*   **Weakening Turkey's NATO Ties**: Russia has "seriously shake[n] [[analysis_of_turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | TÃ¼rkiye]]'s relations with [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]]" [01:14:33]. While Turkey remains a partner, it is no longer considered a "reliable partner" [01:14:42]. The speaker notes that it is difficult for [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] to trust Turkey's command level [01:15:15], and Turkey has "built walls between itself and [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] in recent years" [01:15:32]. This shift is seen as a "great gain for both Russia and Iran" [01:15:46].
*   **Targeting Germany**: Following its success with Turkey, Russia aims to "tear Germany off its branch" from [[geopolitical_analysis_of_nato_and_countrys_foreign_policies | NATO]] [01:15:54].

The speaker believes that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty serves as a historical example of a potential Germany-Russia alliance that could be repeated in the future [01:03:39].

## European Alliances and Power Balance
The 1683 Ottoman defeat at Vienna (by Polish King Jan Sobieski) marked a turning point in European history, shifting European foreign policy from a "reconciliation war against the Muslim world" to managing the "balance of power among itself" [00:53:49]. The perceived threat was no longer the Ottomans, but competition among European states themselves [00:53:52]. This competitive dynamic prevented any single European state from fully capitalizing on Ottoman weakness, such as conquering Istanbul, for fear of escalating conflicts with rivals like France or Russia [00:53:08].

## Communist Parties in Europe
While not a direct geopolitical alliance, the decline of communist parties across Western Europe post-1991 reflects broader [[historical_and_political_transformation_in_global_power_dynamics | historical and political transformation in global power dynamics]]:
*   **Post-1991 Collapse**: Communist parties in Western Europe generally "fell apart," "dissolved," and were "erased from the scene" after 1991 [01:28:22]. Many either became marginalized or lost their distinct identity by focusing on unrelated issues [01:28:44].
*   **Reasons for Collapse**:
    1.  **Decline of the Working Class Movement**: The European working class movement, once a powerful force for improving social status and even influencing administration, significantly "lost its influence and weakened" after 1945, disappearing as an organized political force [01:31:28]. This removed the "most important source of power, tradition, [and] belief" for communist parties [01:31:57].
    2.  **Loss of Soviet Support**: During the Cold War, communist parties benefited from the Soviet Union's "organizational support, financial support," and a sense of "international solidarity" [01:32:42]. This support, largely psychological but also tangible, was cut off by Gorbachev in the late 1980s, leading to the parties' collapse [01:33:43].
    3.  **End of Persecution**: The "sense of brotherhood" and "solidarity" among communists was fostered by "common struggle and common persecution" [01:34:08]. When Western states ceased prosecuting communist parties, this "temperament" and party engagement "sinks" [01:34:40].
*   **Greek Anomaly**: The Greek Communist Party (KKE) remains relatively strong, securing around 7% of the vote [01:27:21], unlike others in Europe. This is attributed to Greece's history of "very bloody, very terrible civil war" in the 1940s and severe persecution during the 1967-1974 Greek colonels' junta [01:35:06]. The "memories of this struggle" keep the party viable [01:35:58].

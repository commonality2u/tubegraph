Recent political developments in the United States, particularly since the [[donald_trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | Donald Trump]] administration took office, indicate significant shifts in both foreign policy and financial approaches to international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Revamp of International Aid and Influence
Within two weeks of the new administration, unprecedented decisions began to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

### USAID Suspension and Abolition
A critical event involved the freezing of all civil society grants for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Subsequently, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), responsible for transferring billions of dollars to foreign countries for political and cultural purposes, was reportedly abolished after an initial three-month disabling period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. The organization's website was also closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. This move is considered a significant blow to one of the primary pillars of the American Empire's international dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. USAID's annual budget was approximately $60 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, which was distributed to political parties, press, academic institutions, and individuals abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

The cessation of these funds is expected to lead to the bankruptcy of many media organizations and civil society organizations across Europe and surrounding countries, including Serbia, Armenia, Greece, and [[turkeys_relations_with_western_countries_post1974 | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. This drastic cut, estimated at $60 billion, marks a geopolitical revolution and an earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. The long-term consequences of this sudden financial adjustment are currently unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Shift in Diplomatic Posture
Beyond financial adjustments, a notable shift in American diplomatic discourse has been observed.

### Marco Rubio's Statements
The new U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made highly striking statements in an interview, indicating a fundamental change in American foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. His discourse, which has not been heard since the 1970s, suggests an end to an 80-year period in American foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Rubio declared the end of the era of global dominance, acknowledging the existence of multiple great powers, at least three, in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. He advocated for a balance-of-power policy based on mutual national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. This turnaround from someone previously seen as a fanatic to a voice of reason was described as terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

The proposed international balance model is not new, reflecting principles of European diplomacy from before 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. However, after World War I, and especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the U.S. fell into a "pathological" passion for world domination, influenced by an "adolescent" and fact-ignoring "Star Trek world" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Rubio's statement signifies the end of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

## Underlying Reasons for Policy Shifts
The changes are likely driven by a combination of factors.

### Financial and Ideological Bankruptcy
Following the Covid crisis, the Afghanistan crisis, and subsequent crises in Ukraine and Gaza, the United States appears to have experienced not only ideological and diplomatic bankruptcy but also financial bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. The depletion of financial resources has led to an attempt at damage control, with the conclusion that managing the entire world, or at least using current methods, is no longer feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This has prompted budget cuts in foreign aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Historical Context of American Influence
The United States has historically played a significant role in shaping global thought and political systems.

### Contributions to Human Dignity and Democracy
America, born as a revolutionary project, expanded the horizons of human imagination and ideas about governable societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. It sparked excitement globally throughout the 19th century and had profound effects in the 20th century through its political ideals, legal system, industrial organization, and banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. Despite being a society based on genocide, it conducted experiments that excited people and built a new philosophy of governance, introducing democracy as an indispensable value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. Its ideas were widely accepted globally until the 1960s and 70s, facing less initial resistance than the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

### Propaganda and Information Dominance
American behavior, such as turning propaganda into a national cause and invading global public areas with it, is historically unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:26">[01:55:26]</a>. The British and Soviet Empires did not engage in propaganda on the same scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:39">[01:55:39]</a>. Hollywood, for instance, became an essential element of national security policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a>. The absolute dominance of American news agencies in feeding the world's international news needs has been largely unmatched until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:26">[01:56:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The current phase of American foreign policy indicates a move away from its global dominant posture, with potential consequences for international media, civil society, and the overall global political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. The shift reflects a realization that the previous strategies of global management, and the financial resources required for them, are no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

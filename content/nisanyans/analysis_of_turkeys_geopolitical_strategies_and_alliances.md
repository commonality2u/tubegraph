From: [[nisanyans]] <br/> 

Türkiye's geopolitical strategies and alliances are shaped by a complex interplay of historical legacy, regional dynamics, and global power shifts. The country's unique position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East necessitates a multi-faceted foreign policy approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics and Foreign Policy

Internal political thought, such as Kemalism, is described as having significantly impacted the country's trajectory. Kemalism, having been the basis of Türkiye's education for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, is characterized as a "worldview that people whose mental development has stopped at the age of 9-10 have adopted and are attached to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, lacking "any rational basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Critics of Kemalism often face strong reactions, as expressing ideas against it is seen as a "threat to their existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This intellectual stagnation contributes to the country's "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, hindering its "dreams of reaching contemporary civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. These internal characteristics influence [[Turkeys political landscape after recent elections | Turkey's political landscape]] and, by extension, its foreign policy decision-making.

## Geopolitical Standing and Strategic Targets

Türkiye's strategic target and "natural hinterland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a> lie in its "old Ottoman Byzantine geography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, encompassing the Balkans and the [[Middle East Politics and Turkeys Role | Eastern Mediterranean basin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Historically, both the Ottoman Empire and the Byzantine Empire maintained their existence by balancing Western and Eastern influences, developing an ideology and discourse appealing to both Belgrade and Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Future success for Türkiye depends on its ability to balance these two cultural and political tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, offering a message that resonates with diverse populations like Macedonians, Greeks, Armenians, Georgians, Arabs, and Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

### Relations with the "Turkish World"

The concept of a "Turkish world" comprising the 5 Republics in Azerbaijan and Central Asia is considered a "small incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> rather than a significant geopolitical quantity comparable to the Western or Far Eastern worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. While Türkiye had an opportunity to build closer ties with these republics after 1991 due to shared culture and investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, there are "very strong tensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a> that could become serious in the long run. For instance, Azerbaijan has historically been an enemy of Türkiye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, and its current friendship is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

Furthermore, these Central Asian republics maintain "very close relations with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a> and are unlikely to leave Russia's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Türkiye cannot establish strong alliances with them without considering the "Russian factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Some in Russia view Türkiye's engagement with these countries positively, as it brings Türkiye into Russia's sphere of influence and necessitates cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This aligns with Eurasianist thought, which views Eurasia as a blend of Russian and Turkish elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Thus, the "Turkic Republics and the Turkish Union are only a footnote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a> in Türkiye's broader strategic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

### [[Global geopolitical changes and Turkeys position | Global Geopolitical Shifts]] and Major Conflicts

#### Russia-Ukraine War and Middle East

The idea that the Russia-Ukraine War was intended to weaken Russia before a potential "Great War in the Middle East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> is dismissed. Instead, Russia is seen as "much stronger today, both militarily and diplomatically, compared to two years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Its economic and industrial viability has been proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, and its army has gained significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. Furthermore, Russia has improved relations with China, Arab countries, Africa, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. The outcome of a serious war in the Middle East would be determined by the stance of Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. The possibility of Russia joining an anti-American coalition is "much, much stronger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a> than it was two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.

#### Europe and NATO

The European Union's expansion policy, including countries like Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 2023 EU expansion package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>, is seen as unlikely to succeed. The EU is described as a "ghost ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>, and promises made to prospective member states are "clearly lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>, designed by a cornered scammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. This suggests that Türkiye should not expect significant benefits from aligning with the EU in this context.

### Regional Tensions and Alliances

While not explicitly detailed, [[Turkey-Greece relations]] are implied as part of the broader regional dynamics.

#### Azerbaijan and Armenia

Azerbaijan's insistence on claiming the southern Armenian region of Zangezur (Syunik) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a> creates a complex three-sided game with Türkiye and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. If Azerbaijan, in cooperation with Türkiye, attempts to annex this region, Iran has repeatedly declared it would consider it a cause for war and "will probably intervene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

Historically, the maps of "Great Armenia" and "Kurdistan" show significant overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. In the early 19th century, some considered "the other name of Armenia is Kurdistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a> due to the shared geography, despite distinct northern Armenian and southern Kurdish regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. There was a clear historical understanding of a "common giant state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a> for both Armenians and Kurds, based on their complementary societal functions: Kurds excelling in military and animal husbandry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>, Armenians in agriculture, trade, and civil organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>, implying a symbiotic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. This symbiosis ended with the spread of capitalism and nationalism, as Armenians turned their backs on Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>, and the Ottoman Empire "cleansed" the old Kurdish aristocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>, leading to a focus on tribal looting over cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>. Currently, Armenia's future is uncertain, while "Kurdistan is growing bigger and bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>, potentially extending to Adana and Mersin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.

## Critiquing State Policies in Wartime

The discussion touches on the ethics of criticizing state policies during war. The newspaper Haret, for instance, is praised for continuing to criticize the Israeli government, despite the latter's claims of being at war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. Israel is not considered to be at war, but rather conducting a "massacre operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, akin to the destruction of Warsaw by the Nazi army in 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. War is defined as a "two-sided event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. It is noted that "almost 70% of the Israeli population" believes Benjamin Netanyahu is a traitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a> who is "dragging Israel into disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. The "real disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a> is a government initiating a massacre despite significant public opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The speaker highlights that questioning the state's actions is important, especially when a country's government embarks on policies not supported by a large segment of its population.

## Future Outlook

Türkiye's path forward is seen as being either a "two-winged Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> that balances its Orthodox semi-western Christian culture in Rumelia with its Middle Eastern and Anatolian Islamic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, or it risks falling into a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> by solely adopting Western Europeanism or Islamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Another "attractive" alternative is focusing on [[Geopolitical analysis of Trkiyes borders and international relations | Türkiye's relations with the North]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Ultimately, Türkiye's long-term success hinges on its ability to skillfully navigate and balance these diverse cultural and geopolitical tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

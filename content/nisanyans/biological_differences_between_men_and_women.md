The idea that women's limited representation in certain fields is due to oppression or [[male_dominance_and_its_impact_on_womens_opportunities | male domination]] is dismissed as incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Instead, it is argued that understanding human psychology reveals fundamental [[evolutionary_psychology_and_its_influence_on_gender_dynamics | biological differences]] between sexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Genetic and Biological Functions
Men and women possess different biological functions and genetic structures, which lead to distinct psychological advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Core Biological Function of Women
> The primary biological function for women is giving birth and ensuring the child's safety, care, and feeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Men, in contrast, have historically sought to compensate for their biological "dysfunctions," weaknesses, or insignificance in the biological field by developing skills and ambitions in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Primate Analogy
Humans are fundamentally similar to other primates like monkeys, gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The functional differences between males and females observed in mammals are described as obvious and logical, stemming from biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

While [[cultural_and_societal_norms | societal organization]] and human pursuits like science, art, and politics are seen as "decorations," the underlying human function remains that of an animal primarily focused on sexual intercourse and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Within these fundamental functions, the capabilities of women and men differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Historical and Cultural Perspectives
Historically, across various [[cultural_and_historical_perspectives_on_gender_roles | cultures]] including ancient times, the Middle Ages, modern Europe, Aegean and American natives, and Islamic culture, there has been a noticeable scarcity of women excelling in fields such as visual arts, music, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This trend is observed even when [[impact_of_societal_roles_on_womens_achievements | opportunities are given]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Modern Interpretations
It is suggested that the modern age often values ideological falsehoods over objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. While the discussion of equality and rights for women in a complex [[cultural_and_societal_norms | society]] is acknowledged as necessary, the foundational understanding is rooted in human biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

The question of whether Fatih Sultan Mehmet was an intellectual, extremely cultured, omniscient individual is a common one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. When examining [[historical_sources_about_fatih_sultan_mehmet | historical sources]], it's important to recognize that old histories, including those of the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, China, and India, often contain stereotyped sentences and eulogies about rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This applies to Roman and Byzantine emperors, Abbasid caliphs, and rulers of medieval Turkish states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Authors might portray a sultan as an exemplary figure or, conversely, as a deplorable one, depending on their intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Ottoman Turkish Sources

Very little detailed information about Fatih Sultan Mehmet's personal character or intellectual pursuits can be definitively gleaned from Turkish Ottoman sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Notable works include:
*   The history of Aşıkpaşazade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   A history of Fatih Sultan Mehmet written shortly after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A history of houses from the 1860s-70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   An official work produced towards the end of the Fatih Age, around the 1460s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

These are considered official histories, but the attitude of Turkish historians towards Fatih Sultan Mehmet is described as "extremely good and dirty and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Especially towards the latter years of his reign, Fatih Sultan Mehmet was not a beloved Sultan; he was often identified with cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He notably raided and crushed the Turkish Islamic aristocracy in Anatolia, seizing their power and property and executing many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. His 30-year rule was characterized by constant warfare, with declarations of war on different fronts almost every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## [[perspectives_from_byzantine_historians_on_fatih_sultan_mehmet | Byzantine Historians' Perspectives]]

More detailed information, including accounts of Fatih Sultan Mehmet's intellectual interests, comes from Byzantine historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The two main sources are Halkondylis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> and Ducas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Both lived during Fatih's time, personally met him, and were aware of the situation within his palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

However, their writings, which often contained praises, also carried political agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These historians were closely involved with Italian states like Genoa and Venice, and were aware of the political situations in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Their works often had an ulterior motive to defend Italian interests within the new world balances, or to establish alliances or rapprochements between the Ottomans and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This reflects the complex [[the_political_and_diplomatic_context_of_fatih_sultan_mehmets_reign | diplomatic realities]] of the era, where the Ottoman state was intensely engaged with various European states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

It is in this context that certain cliché expressions about Fatih Sultan Mehmet emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. These expressions often present him as similar to the rulers of Renaissance Italian city-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Statements claiming he knew Latin and Italian, or was aware of Christianity, should prompt a historian to ask *why* such things were said, rather than immediately questioning their truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Historians cannot be certain about the accuracy of statements made about sultans and state administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Whether a statement is in favor or against a ruler, the underlying motivation for its utterance must be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Often, words used to describe sultans are cliché, pre-fabricated phrases, regardless of whether they are positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

For instance, common phrases attributed to rulers, such as being "very religious" or "not religious," being a poet, or even personally drawing architectural plans for major projects, are often quoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It is impossible to definitively confirm the veracity of such statements, even if one were to interact with the ruler directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Information about rulers is disseminated through various channels, making it extremely difficult to ascertain objectivity centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

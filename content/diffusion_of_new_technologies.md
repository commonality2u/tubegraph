The diffusion of new technologies, including potentially transformative ones like Artificial Intelligence (AI), is generally a slow process characterized by numerous bottlenecks and constraints. Explosive economic growth (e.g., 20%+) due to new technologies is difficult to achieve across an entire economy.

## Reasons for Slow Diffusion

Several factors contribute to the typically slow pace of technological diffusion and its economic impact:

### 1. Cost Disease and Sectoral Differences
Even if some sectors of an economy rapidly adopt and benefit from a new technology like AI, other sectors may not be able to utilize it as effectively. [[cost_disease_and_economic_bottlenecks | Cost disease and economic bottlenecks]] Large portions of the economy, such as government consumption (estimated 18%), healthcare (almost 20%), education (6-7%), and the nonprofit sector, may be slow to integrate AI. These sectors are unlikely to disappear or be replaced quickly due to failure to adopt AI; such transitions could take decades (e.g., 30 years). Consequently, rapid growth in less-regulated, AI-adopting sectors only provides a modest boost to overall economic growth rates. [[economic_growth_and_ai | Economic growth and AI]]

### 2. Binding Constraints and Diminishing Returns
The "cost disease" is an instantiation of a more general problem: when one factor of production (like intelligence from AI) significantly increases, other constraints in the system become more binding. The marginal importance of these other scarce factors rises, while the marginal value of adding more of the abundant factor (e.g., intelligence) decreases. This self-limiting mechanism applies to growth. [[impact_of_intelligence_and_skills_on_economic_progress | Impact of intelligence and skills on economic progress]]

Classical economists like Malthus and Ricardo understood this principle of diminishing returns, even if they applied it to human population growth rather than AI. They recognized that increasing one input (like labor/population) would face diminishing returns due to other scarce factors. This historical understanding of pessimism intrinsic in diminishing returns is often underestimated, particularly in regions like the Bay Area that may overvalue intelligence as a singular driver of change.

### 3. Human and Institutional Bottlenecks
Humans themselves, along with their institutions, represent significant bottlenecks.
* **Institutional Inertia:** Implementing new technologies like AI within existing structures can be slow and challenging. An example is a committee at a mid-tier state university tasked with developing a plan for AI in the curriculum, which may produce a report but little immediate, transformative action.

* **Social Opposition:** As a new technology begins to visibly change the world, opposition can arise from people who are uncomfortable with the changes, even if they see benefits. This can lead to "massive fights" that act as bottlenecks. [[impact_of_technological_change_on_politics | Impact of Technological Change on Politics]]
* **Regulation and Law:** Existing systems of regulation, law, and government processes (e.g., clinical trials for drugs) can slow down the implementation and impact of technological advancements. [[challenges_in_ai_governance | Challenges in AI Governance]]

### 4. Energy Supply
The ability to expand energy supply is another critical bottleneck for widespread technological implementation, particularly for energy-intensive technologies. [[data_center_energy_requirements_and_scaling | Data center energy requirements and scaling]] While there are some encouraging signs (e.g., nuclear power), progress is often slow, and widespread adoption faces hurdles. The current pace of energy expansion may only be a "smidgen" of what's needed for certain technological visions.

## Expert Consensus and Market Signals
Experts who study the diffusion of new technologies generally do not anticipate rapid takeoffs. This view is supported by market data, such as real interest rates and stock prices, which, as of the discussion, appeared "startlingly normal" and did not forecast super-rapid growth. Economic growth experts, while acknowledging AI's potential to accelerate growth, are also not predicting "super rapid growth." The perspective is that new technologies will be "amazing in the long run" but will involve a "tough slog" with many "bottlenecks in the short run."

## Historical Perspectives
* **Industrial Revolution:** A profoundly transformative period, the Industrial Revolution saw typical economic growth rates of about 1.5% per year. This highlights the importance of compounding over long periods rather than immediate explosive change.

* **China's Catch-Up Growth:** China experienced decades of 10% economic growth after Deng Xiaoping's reforms. However, this started from a very low per capita income (around $200). While an example of rapid growth, it's framed as catch-up growth, and China now faces its own scaling challenges as a middle-income country.

* **Long Timelines:** Historically, significant economic shifts, like those from agrarian societies, have taken a very long time.

## Implications for Artificial Intelligence
While AI is expected to be a significant technology, its diffusion and impact on overall economic growth are likely to follow these historical patterns of slowness.
* AI might boost the rate of economic growth by a measure like half a percentage point a year.
* Over 30-40 years, this would be an "enormous difference" and "transform the entire world."
* However, in any given year, the change might not be dramatically noticeable. An example given is a drug that might have taken 20 years to develop now coming in 10, but still needing to go through the existing system of clinical trials and regulation. This represents an immense difference over time but isn't felt as revolutionary in the short term.

The consensus among diffusion experts is that tech diffusion is "universally pretty slow," and there's no robust model showing why this fundamental characteristic should change drastically, despite excitement about AI's capabilities.

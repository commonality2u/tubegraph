Political ideologies play a fundamental role in shaping policy decisions at both the domestic and international levels. In this article, we delve into how these ideologies influence policy, as discussed by Richard Hanania, the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, in a recent podcast interview.

## Overview of Political Ideologies

Political ideologies often dictate the framework within which governments operate. They serve as a set of beliefs about how a society should function, influencing both the goals of policymakers and the methods employed to achieve them.

## The Role of Ideologies in Domestic Policy

### Ideologies and Domestic Policy Formation

Hanania points out that domestically, the influence of ideology is profound, although it manifests differently compared to foreign policy. Political science research indicates that while personal economic circumstances do not highly predict an individual's political orientation, demographic factors and cultural attitudes do ([[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | cultural evolution and collective brains]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59">[17:59]</a>). This suggests that ideologies are more deeply rooted in cultural and demographic identities rather than in economic self-interest.

### Cultural Impact and Policy

The influence of ideology is evident in policies related to social security, taxation, and health care. Certain policies, like social security, are heavily influenced by public opinion, and thus, politicians are careful with reforms in these areas. Hanania argues that in such cases, public opinion acts as a significant counterbalance to ideological impulses ([[ai_ethics_and_deployment_strategies | AI Ethics and deployment strategies]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00">[19:00]</a>).

## Influence of Special Interests on Policy

Hanania discusses the role of special interests, noting they often have a more substantial impact on policy formation than ideologies themselves. In domestic policy, interest groups have power in areas where public opinion is less defined, pushing through legislation that aligns with their interests ([[economic_and_political_implications_of_ai | economic and political implications of AI]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20">[18:20]</a>).

## Political Ideologies and Foreign Policy

### Ideologies as Post-facto Justifications

Hanania suggests that in foreign policy, ideologies often serve as after-the-fact justifications for actions influenced by special interests. This is due in part to the complexity and the perceived distance of foreign policy issues from the everyday voter [[historical_international_relations | (historical international relations)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59">[19:59]</a>).

### Complexity and Manipulation

The absence of direct voter influence in international affairs allows leaders more latitude in manipulating public opinion to support foreign interventions. For example, Hanania discusses how the US formed public opinion during the Iraq War by linking Saddam Hussein to fears of terrorism post-9/11, despite a lack of evidence directly connecting him to the attack [[impact_of_nuclear_weapons_on_global_politics_and_warfare | (impact of nuclear weapons on global politics and warfare)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44">[20:44]</a>).

## The Influence of Lobbying on Policy

Hanania acknowledges the role foreign and domestic lobbies play in shaping US policy. For example, foreign governments like Israel and Saudi Arabia influence American foreign policy insofar as these issues are critical to them, more so than to the American public. These pressures can distort policies away from what might be considered a coherent national strategy [[geopolitical_impact_of_oil | (geopolitical impact of oil)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06">[16:06]</a>).

## Conclusion

Political ideologies remain a guiding force in policy formation, serving as frameworks upon which policies are built or justified, especially when aligned with vested interests. While ideology influences policy deeply, it is often intertwined with and sometimes overshadowed by larger strategic, economic, and special interest considerations that drive both domestic and international agendas.

Oil has been a central and strategic commodity throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, profoundly shaping global geopolitics, international relations, and conflicts [[economic_and_strategic_implications_of_energy_resources | economic and strategic implications of energy resources]]. Understanding the history of oil is key to understanding the major geopolitical shifts of the last 150 years [[the_history_and_evolution_of_the_oil_industry | the history and evolution of the oil industry]]. The concept of "energy security," largely revolving around access to oil, has been a prime motivator for nations.

## Early 20th Century and World War I

The strategic importance of oil began to be recognized in the early 20th century, particularly with its adoption by navies.

### Churchill's Vision and Naval Transformation
Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, made the pivotal decision to convert the British Royal Navy from coal to oil. This was a technologically driven move to gain advantages in speed and efficiency, reducing the need for large crews to shovel coal and lengthy refueling times. Despite concerns about relying on oil from distant Persia (modern-day Iran) rather than domestic Welsh coal, Churchill recognized the strategic imperative, famously calling access to oil "the prize of the venture" [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. He also championed other technological advancements like the tank.

### World War I: Oil as a Strategic Commodity
World War I definitively established oil as a strategic commodity. The nature of warfare transformed rapidly during the conflict, moving from cavalry charges to mechanized warfare involving trucks, tanks, and airplanes. The Allies' superior access to oil provided a critical mobility advantage over the Central Powers. As Britain's future Foreign Secretary remarked, the Allies "floated to victory on a sea of oil" [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]].

## World War II: The Oil War Within
Oil was not the sole cause of World War II, but an "oil war" was fought within the larger conflict. Access to oil was crucial for all major combatants.
*   **Germany:** Hitler's war machine was hampered by limited access to natural oil. Efforts to produce synthetic fuel from coal were insufficient and targeted by Allied bombing. The invasion of the Soviet Union was partly aimed at securing the oil fields of Baku. General Rommel's North African campaign famously suffered from oil shortages.
*   **Japan:** Japan's expansionist policies, particularly in Manchuria, led to a US oil embargo [[role_of_the_us_oil_embargo_and_diplomatic_miscommunications_prewwii | role of the US oil embargo and diplomatic miscommunications pre-WWII]]. Facing the prospect of its fleet becoming "scarecrows" without oil, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor [[japanese_warfare_strategy_and_tactics_during_world_war_ii | Japanese warfare strategy and tactics during World War II]]. Admiral Nimitz noted that if the Japanese had destroyed Pearl Harbor's oil tanks, the Pacific war could have been prolonged by two years. The US actively targeted Japanese oil supply lines, and even kamikaze attacks were partly a fuel-saving measure.
*   **Allies:** The United States was the dominant oil producer, supplying six out of seven barrels of oil used by the Allies. However, even Allied offensives, like General Patton's push into Germany, were sometimes constrained by oil supply [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | Allied versus Axis strategies during World War II]].

## Post-WWII and the Rise of the Middle East

The post-war era saw a significant shift in the global oil landscape, with the Middle East emerging as a pivotal region.

### Discovery and Strategic Importance
Even before WWII, fears of the US running out of oil led the government to support American companies exploring in the Middle East. Geologist Everette DeGolyer reported to the U.S. government during WWI that the "center of gravity of world oil is shifting to the Middle East." Post-WWII, securing these supplies became paramount, partly to prevent them falling into Soviet hands. The first post-war crisis with the Soviet Union concerned a Soviet attempt to seize part of Iran. Oil discoveries in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in 1938, though development was delayed by the war, signaled the region's future importance.

### Shifting Power Dynamics: Nationalization and OPEC
The United States became a net oil importer around 1946-1948. Meanwhile, oil-producing nations in the Middle East and elsewhere began to demand greater control and a larger share of profits from Western oil companies. This was characterized by the "obsolescing bargain," where initial favorable terms for companies eroded over time as host countries asserted more power. This trend was intertwined with the end of colonialism and the rise of national self-determination [[economic_and_political_structures_in_historical_contexts | economic and political structures in historical contexts]], leading to increased nationalization of oil assets [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | Cold War and international alliances]]. Today, host countries typically receive around 80% of oil profits. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was formed in 1960, further consolidating the power of producing nations.

### The 1973 Oil Crisis
The 1973 oil crisis marked a watershed moment. Amidst the Yom Kippur War, Arab oil-producing nations employed the "oil weapon," imposing an embargo and cutting production. While global supply declined by only about 15%, the psychological impact, combined with US price controls and a lack of market transparency, led to panic and severe economic disruption. The US, by then the world's largest importer, was particularly vulnerable, with domestic attention diverted by the Watergate scandal. The crisis dramatically increased the political and economic clout of oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Iran (under the Shah), as "petrodollars" flowed into their economies [[energy_transitions_and_renewable_energy_challenges | energy transitions and renewable energy challenges]].

## Modern Geopolitics of Oil

The geopolitical landscape of oil continues to evolve, driven by new technologies, shifting demand patterns, and the rise of new energy sources.

### The Shale Revolution and US Energy Independence
The development of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") and horizontal drilling, pioneered by figures like George Mitchell, led to the US shale revolution [[fracking_and_its_geopolitical_consequences | fracking and its geopolitical consequences]]. This has profoundly transformed the US energy position. Once the world's largest importer, spending around $400 billion annually on oil imports, the US is now effectively energy independent. US oil production surged from 5 million barrels a day in 2008 to over 13.2 million barrels a day.

### Impact on Global Power Dynamics
*   **Russia:** The US shale gas boom, leading to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, played a crucial role in enabling Europe to counter Russia's energy weapon (particularly natural gas) following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin had recognized the threat shale posed to Russian energy dominance and US influence as early as 2013.
*   **China and Japan:** China, which imports 75% of its oil, views the US energy position with envy. For US allies like Japan, American LNG exports have become critical for their energy security, forming part of the broader security relationship [[geopolitical_implications_on_technology_and_data_centers | geopolitical implications on technology and data centers]]. US LNG is now considered part of NATO's strategic arsenal.

### Energy Transition and New Geopolitical Factors
The global push for energy transition towards renewables introduces new geopolitical dimensions.
*   **Strategic Diversification:** Following Churchill's principle of "safety in variety," renewables like wind and solar offer diversification.
*   **China's Strategic Push:** For China, the shift to renewables and electric vehicles (EVs) is a strategic imperative to reduce its oil import vulnerability (recalling Japan's WWII predicament) and to compete globally in new automotive markets.
*   **Great Power Competition:** Renewables are now enmeshed in great power competition. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs and batteries, and policies like the Inflation Reduction Act aim to bolster domestic renewable industries partly to compete with China.
*   **Mineral Competition:** The energy transition is significantly more mineral-intensive. For instance, an EV uses about two and a half times more copper than a conventional car [[energy_transitions_and_renewable_energy_challenges | energy transitions and renewable energy challenges]]. Meeting 2050 climate goals could require doubling copper supply by 2035, posing challenges given long mine development times. This creates new dependencies and potential geopolitical friction over mineral resources.

The geopolitics of energy, long dominated by oil, is entering a new, more complex phase where traditional fossil fuels coexist with emerging renewable technologies and the critical minerals required to build them.

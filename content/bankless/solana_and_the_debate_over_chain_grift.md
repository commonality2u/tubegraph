The cryptocurrency space often grapples with periods of rapid growth and innovation, frequently followed by instances of fraud and "grift." This pattern has been a recurring theme across different crypto "metas," from ICOs to DeFi Summer and NFTs, and most recently, in the [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coin]] sector on [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Libra Coin Debacle

The third week of February 2024 saw significant drama surrounding the launch of a new meme coin, Libra, on [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The incident highlighted the rapid, unconstrained nature of meme coin launches and the associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Presidential Endorsement and Market Volatility
On Valentine's Day, Argentine President Javier Milei tweeted about a project called "Viva Liberta pro.com" with the ticker "Libra," along with a [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
The Libra token:
*   Immediately launched at an approximate $2.5 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Jumped to $5.5 billion within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Plummeted to $30 million within 90 minutes of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Concerns were immediately triggered as 82% of the Libra tokens were held in one cluster of wallets that spawned the token, and no tokenomics were shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. President Milei later deleted his tweet and claimed he had no connection to the project, attributing the situation to "filthy rats of the political castle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Key Players and Their Roles
*   **Hayden Davies (Kelsey Ventures)**: This individual, previously unheard of by many in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, emerged as supposedly being behind the Libra meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. He later admitted in a Coffeezilla interview that he, or Kelsey Ventures, "sniped" the Libra supply to front-run other snipers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Davies also admitted involvement in the Melania token launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It was reported that Davies, a U.S. citizen, gained access to Javier Milei through his sister, sending her money and asserting control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Jupiter and Meteora**: Meow, the founder of Jupiter, issued a statement clarifying that Jupiter employees were seen trading Libra, but the company had no insider information or involvement in the token's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Meteora, a more sophisticated Automated Market Maker (AMM) founded by Meow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, did not have the same level of deniability. Ben Chow from Meteora stepped down, attempting to distance himself from the Libra launch, but an ongoing association between Meteora and Hayden Davies for not just Libra but also the M3 and Melania tokens was revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. There is speculation that Meteora itself might have been involved in front-running Hayden Davies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Dave Portnoy**: He was paid Libra tokens by Hayden Davies to promote the coin but returned them after Hayden requested he not disclose the promotion. Portnoy, having insider information, still bought the token early and lost money, which was refunded by Hayden Davies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

> "This is not nearly as bad as FTX, but this is the worst thing in the crypto industry since FTX." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

> "It's the worst thing this year so far." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

## The "Crime Chain" Debate

The Libra incident reignited the debate about the inherent level of grift in different crypto "metas." Anatoly, co-founder of [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]], tweeted that [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | DeFi Summer]] (on Ethereum) was "way worse" due to "leverage loops that created a nasty House of Cards," and that there's "virtually no contagion in meme coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This sparked strong reactions, particularly from the Ethereum community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

> "ICOs were were you know just as bad if not worse than than meme coins because the interesting thing about meme coins is okay you know these guys pulled out 100 Mil right... then you look at like Meteora and you know people added it up let's say it was like 3 billion like the e was $4 billion right... you know there were so many 50 100 $150 million ICOs in 2018 that just like evaporated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>

Kane Warwick elaborated on the comparison:
*   **ICOs (2018)**: Described as "crime central," where Ico Mills would find young teams, write whitepapers, do tokenomics, and use syndicates to buy tokens in pre-sales, then dump them on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Losses were substantial, with $150 million ICOs disappearing, representing a significant portion of the market cap at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **DeFi Summer**: Characterized by "10,000% APY pool two" schemes and being highly "PVP" (Player vs. Player), onboarded existing crypto natives rather than new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
*   **NFT Mints**: Similarly ended in "grift," with events like the Azuki Elementals mint cited as a "jump the shark" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Meme Coins**: While still involving "grift," the scale of direct losses from rugs is often limited by the liquidity in the pools (e.g., $2 million in liquidity for a $2 billion market cap coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. However, the "industrialization of the [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coin]] launch" meant that the schemes were becoming more sophisticated and exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

> "The fact is that [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] is the chain where there's the most activity, there's the most stuff going on and grifters are going to go to where the liquidity is... it's not surprising that there's crime happening on [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] because that's where [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]] are happening." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>

## Market Impact and Future of Meme Coins

The Libra scandal led to a significant retracement in the [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coin]] market, with an estimated $6 billion in market cap erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Bloomberg even ran a headline: "Argentina Scandal Fuels Sell Off on Favorite Meme Coin Platform," referring to [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Despite the setbacks, [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]] are seen as a "primitive" of the industry and are unlikely to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. They represent the "platonic ideal of speculation" where tokens "pop into existence" in a "very PVP game" with low liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. The challenge arises when information or technical asymmetry is exploited for "Max Extract" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

There's speculation that this moment might mark the "top for the attention of [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]]," with the market pivoting to something else, possibly even a comeback for ICOs, which inherently have more utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## Solana's Challenge: Self-Policing and Community Perception

The controversy highlights a critical challenge for [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]]:
*   **Underdog Mentality vs. Dominant Platform**: As [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] gains activity and liquidity, it attracts grifters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. The historical "underdog mentality" of circling the wagons to defend the chain against critics (like [[comparing_ethereum_and_solana_in_terms_of_rev | Ethereum]] Maxis calling it a "crime chain") is no longer effective when grifters are "in your house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Need for Self-Policing**: [[Solana governance and monetary policy debate | Solana]] needs to develop an "immune system" to identify and address bad actors and prevent platforms like Meteora from being "co-opted for extraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. This requires the ability to "discern a good actor versus a bad actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

The broader crypto community continually faces the tension between permissionless innovation and the inevitable emergence of fraudulent activities. While regulatory bodies like the SEC are forming "cyber police" units to combat fraud across emerging technologies and crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>, there's a strong argument that industries should prioritize [[solana_governance_and_monetary_policy_debate | self-policing]] to avoid the "unintended consequences of overregulation" and the risk of regulatory tools being "co-opted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

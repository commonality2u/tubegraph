The concept of "REV," or Real Economic Value, has emerged as a key metric in discussing the [[Valuation of Layer 1 blockchain tokens | valuation]] of smart contract platforms. REV, in this context, refers to all network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips paid by users on a given network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This metric specifically captures network-level fees, excluding application-level fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Historical Correlation and Interpretation
John Sharbon's tweet highlighted a correlation between the all-time high prices of ETH (late 2021) and SOL (January 2022) and their "REV multiples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Both tokens traded at similar multiples to their annualized REV at their price peaks, which also coincided with their highest points of REV generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

This correlation leads to two interpretations:
1.  **Rational Market**: The market is trading rationally, valuing assets based on their ability to generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Correlation**: High on-chain activity during bull markets naturally leads to increased fees and MEV, correlating with price peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

The market appears to be increasingly considering signs of user willingness to pay for network usage as one of multiple [[Fundamentals and Crypto Valuation Techniques | factors in token valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### REV as a Metric
REV can be viewed in two ways, analogous to traditional finance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:05]</a>:
*   **Value Capture Metric**: In a Proof-of-Stake network, token holders are entitled to receive all REV generated by the network, whether through burning or dividends to stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This functions like a top-line revenue metric for a traditional company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Indicator**: It explicitly shows what users are willing to pay to use a given network, acting as a direct measure of demand for block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## REV and Native Asset Value
Smart contract platforms have a native asset and block space, with the latter possessing utility value downstream from the applications built on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. REV strongly correlates with the utility value of block space and the equity-like part of an ecosystem's [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

However, REV is not universally applicable to all crypto assets. For example, Bitcoin has zero REV but is the most highly valued crypto asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This suggests that for smart contract platforms, REV is more relevant due to the utility value of their block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Valuation
The crypto industry is still nascent, and there is no established consensus on how to properly value these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. While traditional finance has coalesced around models like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), crypto is still figuring it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

> "I think it's important to note that like no one knows what they're talking about in our industry and we're all just doing our best to try to figure out like okay how do you quantify whatever the hell it is that we are building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>

Cash flows, represented by REV, are considered the *minimum intrinsic value* of these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. If an asset generates cash flow, its value isn't solely dependent on being sold for a higher price; it provides direct returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Currently, most large crypto assets are still quite "divorced" from this intrinsic value, suggesting they are pricing in significant future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

## Chain-Specific Valuations and the Future of REV
The debate around REV often divides along "tribal lines" (e.g., Ethereum vs. Solana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.

*   **Ethereum**: Tends to emphasize "holding state" and credible neutrality, with less focus on raw transaction velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. While Ethereum has garnered significant stablecoin value on-chain ($150 billion), its native asset (ETH) has shown a "lackluster response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This suggests a different valuation approach, where a "special snowflake" quality akin to Bitcoin's monetary properties holds significant weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.
*   **Solana**: Optimizes for "state transitions," speed, and high-frequency trading (decentralized NASDAQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>. As such, REV is a more dominant [[Impact of staking and DeFi on token value | valuation]] factor for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. Solana's REV primarily comes from contentious state, priority fees, and MEV, unlike Ethereum's historical reliance on base fees from congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>.

It is speculated that newer smart contract platforms will become even more REV-focused, as the "Layer 1 premium" (beyond cash flows) diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.

### The Role of Applications and Abstraction
While REV measures block space utility, the direct value of applications (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap on Ethereum; Pump Fun, Drift on Solana) also drives demand for the native asset as a "unit of account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. For instance, ETH was money for NFTs, and SOL was money for memecoins, driving their respective REV peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

However, the future might see increased "chain abstraction," where users interact with apps using stablecoins (like USDC) rather than native assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. This could reduce the native asset's role as a medium of exchange, impacting its monetary properties and potentially its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Apps are also expected to "internalize" value that currently leaks to the chain as REV. This could involve more efficient AMM designs, better liquidations, or even apps building their own chains if they cannot internalize enough value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:14:00">[55:14:00]</a>. Over time, the bargaining power is expected to shift more towards the apps, reducing the margins captured by the base layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the market's current [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | valuation]] of smart contract platforms might be a looser assessment of which chain is "winning" in user and developer adoption, leading to an expectation that the gap between different platform valuations will close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>. While REV is becoming a more important metric, it's acknowledged that current REV figures might not be the best indicators of future REV, as market efficiency could lead to compression of margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>.

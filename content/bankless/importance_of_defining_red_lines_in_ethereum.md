Historically, the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] has been characterized by being "too nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While this niceness can be positive, it contrasts with the approach taken by Bitcoin, which has successfully defined its core identity and asset.

## Bitcoin's Coordinated Stance

Bitcoin (BTC) proponents have been effective in establishing a clear social definition for the BTC asset as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This includes behaviors such as shaming individuals for creating too many tokens or incorrectly labeling tokens as "coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This firm stance acts as a coordination mechanism, reinforcing BTC's singular position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Call for Ethereum's "Red Lines"

It is argued that the Ethereum community must explicitly define "red lines"â€”specific principles or characteristics that are non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Furthermore, there must be a collective agreement on what these red lines entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Without such shared understanding and enforcement, a perpetually "nice" approach can lead to a perception of disarray or irrelevance, making the community appear "schizo" and out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Critical Areas for Definition

For Ethereum, critical red lines involve ensuring that:
*   Ethereum is established and maintained as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The Ethereum technology, specifically its [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | settlement layer]], remains recognized as a fundamental ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Failure to solidify these definitions means a fundamental loss for Ethereum's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This emphasis on clear, non-negotiable definitions contributes to [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | social consensus]] and can be seen as a form of [[maximalism_and_nationalism_in_the_ethereum_community | maximalism]] necessary for the network's long-term success.

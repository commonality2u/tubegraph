Silicon photonics is a burgeoning field poised to become as significant in the 21st century as silicon electronics was in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. Unlike traditional silicon electronics, where computation occurs via electrons, silicon photonics utilizes photons for its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Current Status and Commercialization
As of recently, silicon photonics is just beginning to see its first real commercial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The emergence of these applications initiates a crucial feedback loop: revenue generation leads to investment, which in turn drives down costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. This process fosters the development of optimized fabrication facilities for photonics (distinct from electronics), improves supply chains, and enhances the reliability of components like on-chip lasers, which are essential for silicon photonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

## Strategic Importance and Competition
The development of silicon photonics is considered to be of national strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. Currently, no single entity is significantly ahead in this technology, presenting an opportunity for the United States to lead in silicon photonics manufacturing if a strategic approach is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

However, countries like China and Taiwan have also recognized silicon photonics as a critical technology for the coming decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. Over the past 18 months, they have begun to invest heavily in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major player in chip manufacturing, has historically packaged silicon photonics chips made by other fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. Packaging is considered more challenging than chip fabrication itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Approximately 18 months ago, TSMC ceased packaging silicon photonics chips produced by other companies, effectively requiring all related processes to be handled internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. This move strongly incentivizes leading companies to work exclusively with TSMC, making it harder for other entities to gain traction in silicon photonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This strategic decision by Taiwan and TSMC underscores the perceived importance of silicon photonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## Future Implications for the United States
To revitalize manufacturing in the United States, it is essential to cultivate approximately ten companies akin to [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | SpaceX]] and [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | Tesla]], which are vertically integrated and primarily manufacture in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Focusing on new, less mature areas like silicon photonics, where no one currently holds a significant lead, is crucial for establishing vertically integrated supply chains and getting ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. By achieving a cutting edge in technologies such as space and silicon photonics, coupled with advancements in [[The potential of synthetic biology and its applications | humanoid robotics]] by companies like [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | Tesla]], the United States can unlock numerous opportunities for quality of life improvements for the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | hardware]]-driven approach is vital, as [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | hardware]] revolutions typically precede [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | software]] revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. While [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | AI]] is expected to be limited by [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] for the next 5 to 10 years, advancements in areas like silicon photonics will lead to significant improvements in efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. For example, a gigawatt data center could potentially achieve the same output with 10 megawatts, representing a 100x improvement, purely through better [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] like silicon photonics and improved interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This co-evolution of [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] and [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | software]], even with [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | software]] evolving faster, signifies a promising period for technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

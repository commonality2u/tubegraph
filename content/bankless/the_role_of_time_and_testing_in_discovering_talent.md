Discovering and integrating truly exceptional talent into a functional, high-performing team is a process that requires significant time and rigorous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This process cannot be rushed, as it involves understanding an individual's full capabilities and reliability over an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Rarity of Top Talent

Identifying individuals with "out of this world" talent is inherently difficult due to their scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Such individuals are encountered infrequently, perhaps only "a couple of these people every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Importance of Sustained Testing

Once identified, understanding the true potential and reliability of these gifted individuals demands a long-term commitment to testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It can take a decade of continuous evaluation to genuinely learn what someone is capable of and to confirm their dependability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Long-Term Nature of Team Development

The culmination of this time and testing is the assembly of a highly effective collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For instance, leaders like Elon Musk have spent 20 to 30 years building a core group of approximately 20 exceptionally talented people around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These individuals, such as Mark Josa at SpaceX or Steve Davis at Boring Company, are "out of this world talented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The outcome is a cohesive unit where members achieve a "mind meld," working together seamlessly, often without needing verbal communication to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This level of [[importance_of_a_strong_value_system_and_team_dynamics | team dynamics]] and [[building_a_highperforming_team | high-performing team]] cohesion cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It requires approximately 20 years to construct an "organism" that is self-sustaining and maximally effective, illustrating [[the_gradual_development_of_success | the gradual development of success]] and [[effective_team_management_and_growth_strategies | effective team management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

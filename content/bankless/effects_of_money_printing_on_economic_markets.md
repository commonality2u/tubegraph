Concerns have been raised by non-Americans regarding the safety of property domiciled in the United States, particularly if the US were to implement capital controls or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such measures could lead to capital exiting US shores, potentially causing the S&P to decline and replicating effects seen post-liberation day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Impact of Capital Exits

The outflow of capital from the US is mathematically tied to a reduction in the capital account surplus, requiring foreigners to sell their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Foreign capital, comprising trillions of dollars in export earnings parked in American markets, has historically been the foundation for the outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the last 30 years compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Therefore, if foreigners withdraw their capital, these markets are expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even a marginal exodus of foreign investors can lead to market drops, as exemplified by the period from April 2nd to April 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Role of Money Printing

A consistent response to market downturns, especially in the bond market, and increases in [[market_volatility_and_economic_uncertainty | volatility]], is the printing of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Should capital controls be implemented, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and politicians would be compelled to collaborate on policies to supply dollars, effectively replacing the departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This replacement would primarily occur through the printing of new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Market Consequences

The consequence of this money printing is projected to cause [[impact_of_financial_policies_on_gold_and_bitcoin | gold and Bitcoin]] to significantly appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This scenario is considered a key "trade" in the context of a rebalancing global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In fact, this potential outcome is described as "the best thing that could ever happen for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

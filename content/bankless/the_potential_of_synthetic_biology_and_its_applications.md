[[The role of artificial intelligence in accelerating scientific discoveries | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is ushering in a new era for scientific discovery, particularly in the field of synthetic biology. This rapidly advancing area holds the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, from medicine to environmental solutions and material science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The fundamental principle driving these advancements is the ability to understand and manipulate the "organic code" of biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Unprecedented Acceleration in Protein Discovery

The pace of discovery in protein sequencing has seen an unprecedented acceleration due to AI.
Historically:
*   The first person to break down and reverse-engineer a single protein took 12 years using a ruler and pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   Over the subsequent 60 years, only 150,000 proteins were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

With AI:
*   In just the last two years, 250 million proteins have been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   This rapid advancement, occurring early in the [[AI advancements and controversies | AI cycle]], has unlocked a foundational core of biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Understanding proteins at their simplest form enables significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## DNA as Organic Code

DNA can be understood as a serial string of information, similar to how a computer processes ones and zeros, but with more complex combinations (A, T, G, C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Synthetic biology leverages AI's intelligence to correctly order biological proteins, allowing for the creation of new organic structures that can perform almost any desired function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Diverse Applications

The ability to manipulate and mutate biological processes for the first time opens up numerous applications:

*   **Medical Breakthroughs:**
    *   **Curing Blindness:** Gene therapy has been successfully used to restore eyesight to a blind individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Disease Treatment:** [[The role of artificial intelligence in accelerating scientific discoveries | AI-powered DNA sequencing]] and protein understanding can help solve forms of cancer and cure forms of Alzheimer's, which are often a direct result of protein misfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

*   **Environmental Solutions:**
    *   One example is designing protein structures that can eat plastic, which could be deployed in oceans to convert waste into something useful without harming ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

*   **Material Science:**
    *   [[The role of artificial intelligence in accelerating scientific discoveries | AI]] can facilitate the design of new materials, such as heat-resistant rubber tires that last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

*   **Food Supply Chain:**
    *   The entire food supply chain, including how food is made, created, and genetically modified, stands to change significantly as we better understand and refine biological processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

*   **Personalized Nutrition:**
    *   In the future, it may be possible to create food that is precisely tailored to an individual's specific body and nutrient needs, delivered fresh daily and tasting delicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

## Hyper-Acceleration through Intelligence

The rapid advancements in synthetic biology are a direct consequence of the [[The exponential growth of technology and its impact on society | exponential growth of technology]] and the collapse of the cost of [[the_role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_accelerating_scientific_discoveries | intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The increasing sophistication and efficiency of [[AI advancements and controversies | AI models]], coupled with advancements in hardware like [[silicon_photonics_and_its_potential | specialized computing clusters]], mean that complex biological problems can be solved at an unprecedented pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This means that fields like synthetic biology are entering an "age of hyper acceleration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

> "Everything around us is made up by people no smarter than we are. And if you think about it, it's true... We benefit though from the collective accumulation of knowledge over time... The question I think we want to answer in this podcast and the really interesting question is like what happens to the world around us when people are actually smarter than we are?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>

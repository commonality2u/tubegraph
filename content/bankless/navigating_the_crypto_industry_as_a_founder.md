The Bankless podcast explores the frontier of being a startup founder in the internet money and finance space, aiming to encourage "marginal builders" to start creating in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The episode features insights from successful founders like Jesse Pollock (Base), Jeremy Allaire (Circle), Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana), Stani Kulechov (Aave, Lens), Kane Warwick (Synthetix, Infinex), Jason Yanowitz and Mike Ippolito (Blockworks), Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin), and Lucas Bruder (Jito) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## General Principles for Aspiring Founders

### Getting Started and Cultivating Skills
Finding something exciting to work on is the first step, followed by building the smallest possible thing related to that interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This approach allows for a discovery process where small projects aligned with interests can grow into something bigger, helping to build skills and intuition gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Essential qualities for builders include:
*   **Optimism and Determination**: Founders must have the resilience to keep building despite roadblocks, difficulties, and skepticism from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Effective Communication**: Finding a way to tell your story, whether on social media, through blog posts, or conference talks, is crucial to attract support and allow others to join your journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **T-Shaped Skillset**: The best builders are "scrappy" and "t-shaped," possessing deep expertise in one area (e.g., development) but also a broad ability to "put things together" across different skill sets like distribution, collaboration, and team building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Managing Unpopular but Necessary Tasks
Early in a startup's life, founders must "grit it out" and handle all tasks, including unglamorous ones like taxes or accounting, by themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This hands-on experience builds an understanding of what "good results" look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. As the business grows, tasks can be outsourced, but only after the founder has gained sufficient understanding to evaluate performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Time Management and Learning from Action
Prioritizing time effectively is critical for founders, especially in the early stages, by identifying and focusing on high-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. A key philosophy is that "action produces information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. It's better to ship quickly and learn from frequent feedback loops than to get stuck in indecision or long development cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Shipping something every week can rapidly build intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

### Importance of People and Culture
*   **Hiring Smart**: Success in a business or product depends on the people around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Founders should constantly seek people who are better than them in various domains and give them space to create and communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Values-Driven Culture**: Having a strong value system is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Avoid hiring brilliant but toxic individuals, as they can negatively impact morale and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **"Hire Slow, Fire Fast"**: Be deliberate about hiring and act quickly if a hire is not a good fit, as negativity can spread like a "virus" within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   **Embrace Failure**: Failure is beneficial as long as you learn from it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Be willing to cut losses on underperforming products or initiatives, even if significant resources have been invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This can improve morale by ensuring people are working on winning initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Delegation**: As companies grow, founders must learn to delegate. This often means hiring executives who are trusted to build teams and uphold company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Investing in people and culture builds trust, enabling more effective delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Co-Founder Selection**: Choosing a co-founder is like a marriage; prioritize integrity, intelligence, and energy. It's a long journey, and the co-founder relationship is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:31">[01:42:31]</a>.

### Long-Term Mindset and Adaptability
*   **Marathon, Not a Sprint**: Building something truly useful and high-quality takes a significant amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. Founders must prioritize their mental health and recognize that it's a "perseverance game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>.
*   **Product is Never Finished**: Even with a good product and traction, the work doesn't stop. Continually strive to make the product better and expand its distribution to new audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Question Assumptions**: In the chaos of a startup, it's easy to lock into assumptions. Constantly zoom out and re-evaluate problems from first principles to ensure you're on the right path, as the environment is always changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

## Unique Aspects of [[challenges_of_being_a_crypto_startup_founder | Building a Crypto Company]]

### Heightened Skepticism and the Need to Educate
Crypto founders face even greater skepticism than traditional entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. They constantly need to explain and educate others about the technology and its potential, often countering negative perceptions related to misuse by bad actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Passion and Conviction
Despite the challenges, crypto founders often possess a unique level of deep conviction, viewing themselves as "change agents" working to upgrade the world's economic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This passion helps sustain them through difficult times.

### Funding and Capitalization
*   **Bootstrapping vs. VC Funding**: While some businesses, like marketplaces, require significant capital, others, like media, can be bootstrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. Bootstrapping can provide founders with more leverage compared to being on the "VC hamster wheel" from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>.
*   **Thoughtful Capital Raising**: There's a common bias in crypto towards raising too much money too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>. Founders should carefully consider how much capital is truly needed to execute their plan and build a safety margin, rather than just raising a large round for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>. Over-capitalization can lead to a lack of discipline.

### [[Competitive dynamics in DeFi and cryptocurrency platforms | Building a Successful Crypto Company]]: Iteration and Decentralization
*   **Pragmatic Iteration**: Given the inherent uncertainty in startups, especially in a nascent industry, a pragmatic, iterative approach is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. This means delivering something, then continuously iterating on it based on feedback.
*   **The "Wounded Animal" Phase**: Early-stage startups, particularly in crypto, often feel like "wounded animals," constantly fighting for survival and trying to avoid immediate threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. This "starving" mentality can force focus due to limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Shared Trauma as a Unifier**: Experiencing market downturns and challenges (like the FTX collapse for Solana) can forge a stronger, more resilient core community among builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   **Balancing Playbooks and Discovery**: While certain "playbooks" (e.g., hackathons, leaderboards, community engagement on Twitter) provide proven tactics, true innovation comes from a founder's unique vision and insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. The founder must be deeply engaged in the initial stages to communicate their vision and adapt based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Finding "Black Licorice" Users**: Successful products often have a small group of "power users" or "super users" who deeply love the product and are willing to overcome hurdles to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Focusing on these initial 10-20 users, understanding their needs, and iterating with them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Modular Design**: Instead of building centralized monoliths, crypto founders should aim to build modular protocols and applications that do one thing well and are interoperable with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. This approach leverages the "Unix philosophy" and contributes to a more expansive, value-additive ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>.
*   **From "Project" to "Product"**: A product is something that meets a demand with utility or other factors, and has a quality that makes people want to use and even pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Realizing this shift is key, often marked by users investing significant time into the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Community and Credibility**: In crypto, building a community and gaining credibility can be challenging, especially when adopting non-mainstream approaches (e.g., upgradeable contracts vs. immutable ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. It might require operating on "brute force" and consistently building to prove good faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
*   **Mission-Driven Approach**: Focusing on a clear mission attracts "missionaries" (dedicated individuals) rather than "mercenaries" (those primarily motivated by compensation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>. This can create a "cultural shelling point" that galvanizes the community and aids in talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>. The mission should evolve to be understandable and relatable to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:22">[01:48:22]</a>.

## Unexpected Aspects of Founding in Crypto

*   **Social Media Engagement**: Founders, particularly in growing ecosystems like Base, may spend unexpectedly large amounts of time on platforms like Twitter and Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. This direct interaction and recognition of community members are seen as high-leverage activities for [[building_a_successful_crypto_company | building an economy]] and fostering loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.
*   **[[Regulatory developments in the crypto industry | Legal and Regulatory Challenges]]**: The industry's nascent nature means founders must spend significant time navigating legal and regulatory uncertainties, which was often unanticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:26">[02:07:26]</a>.
*   **Scaling Team Dynamics**: Crossing certain team size thresholds (e.g., around 25-30 or 60 people) introduces complex interpersonal coordination and "people problems" that consume substantial time and mental energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. Hiring a talented Head of People is crucial to manage these challenges and allow founders to focus on strategic initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>.
*   **Product Selling for Engineers**: Even engineers who prefer building must actively "sell the product" by engaging with potential users, building trust, and convincing them to adopt the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:53">[02:06:53]</a>. This can involve extensive outreach and personal connection.

Effective [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | asset allocation]] in crypto, especially within a long-term investment horizon, requires a data-driven approach and a deep understanding of market cycles and fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with short-term trading or solely relying on technical analysis (TA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Philosophy of Crypto Investment

The crypto market is still in its early stages of defining [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models | fundamental valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Analogous to the US equities market in the 1940s, where concepts like discounted cash flow were nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, crypto currently largely trades on narratives and speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The objective is to identify and converge on key performance indicators (KPIs) for relative valuation across specific assets and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Data-Driven Approach
> Everything starts with data, from which a thesis is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This involves looking at on-chain data and a wide range of charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. The goal is to deeply understand assets, determine fair value, build conviction, and then hold assets for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:38]</a>.

## Macro Context and Market Signals

Macroeconomic conditions and liquidity play a significant role in informing allocation decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. Shifting from a bearish outlook at the end of last year, a bullish stance is taken due to continued fiscal spending by the US Treasury, which is seen as the primary driver of market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. This aligns with the concept of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), where government deficits create surpluses in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

Potential catalysts include:
*   **Continued Fiscal Spending:** The passage of budget bills implies ongoing liquidity injections into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Legislation:** The potential passing of a stablecoin bill is considered "huge" and discounted by the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. This could allow for increased debt issuance and further liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
*   **Monetary Policy Adaptations:** Policy makers are developing strategies, such as potential changes to the supplemental leverage ratio for banks and Treasury stock buybacks ("shadow QE"), to accommodate future Treasury issuance without disrupting the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

### Market Momentum Indicators
*   **Bitcoin Moving Averages:** A "golden cross" (50-day moving average piercing the 200-day moving average) indicates a bullish pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>. While this signals an aggressive move has occurred and *could* precede a short-term correction, it can also precede continued upward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.
*   **Ethereum Moving Averages:** ETH's 50-day moving average is approaching its 200-day, potentially signaling a golden cross and a catch-up to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Holder Supply (Bitcoin):** This metric indicates market bottoms when long-term holders buy dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:00">[37:25:00]</a>. As the market heats up, long-term holders start to pass coins to short-term holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. The current trend shows long-term holders re-entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Holder to Short-Term Holder Ratio (Bitcoin):** Local tops in price tend to correlate with local bottoms in this ratio, meaning long-term holders have exited and short-term holders have entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:13]</a>. The current rising ratio suggests there's still room for upward movement before the market gets overheated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>.
*   **MVRV Z-Score (Bitcoin):** This metric, which compares market value to realized value, indicates if the market is overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>. Currently at 2.8, it suggests significant room for growth before reaching previous cycle highs (e.g., 7 in 2021, 12 in earlier cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:23:00">[45:23:00]</a>. The "law of diminishing returns" suggests future peaks may be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

## Current Allocation Strategy (Example Portfolio)

A current portfolio reflects a bullish sentiment, aiming for a "meltup" in altcoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>.

*   **Cash Position:** Currently 30% cash, typically maintaining at least 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:00">[53:36:00]</a>. Cash is considered a position, allowing for opportunistic re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>.
*   **Crypto Position:** Approximately 70% deployed into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Bitcoin (BTC):** About 60% of the crypto portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.
    *   **[[role_of_staking_and_defi_in_crypto_valuation | ETH Ecosystem]]**: Approximately 19% allocated, including ETH itself and a "beta bet" on Pepe (WPEPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:58:00">[54:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:08:00">[55:08:00]</a>. Pepe is seen as the "culture coin" of the ETH ecosystem, providing high beta exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Solana (SOL) Ecosystem**: Expressing views on Solana through a beta asset like Bonk (BONK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:24:00">[57:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Celestia (TIA):** A bet on the Data Availability (DA) space, purchased when depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34:00">[57:34:00]</a>. Research focuses on its underlying infrastructure and potential for durable MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Worldcoin (WLD):** An interesting speculative bet for the end of the cycle due to its connection to AI and low float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>. Worldcoin's L2 is notably high in blobs paid to L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

## Rationale for Risk Curve Allocation

Historically, Bitcoin leads the market, followed by altcoins in cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. As Bitcoin's dominance increases and then potentially peaks, capital tends to rotate into alts to capture larger gains further out the risk curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This is driven by human behavior and the desire to maximize returns at the end of a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

The "wealth effect" from Bitcoin profits also fuels [[Potential longterm trends in crypto markets | alt season]], as investors take profits from Bitcoin and reallocate them into altcoins or memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:14:00">[48:14:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Asset Selection is Critical
> Unlike previous cycles (e.g., 2021) where almost everything rose, the market is more sophisticated now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a>. It's crucial to select assets with strong fundamentals or those driven by significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>. The expectation is a "barbell" approach: strong fundamentals on one end, and highly speculative, attention-based assets on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:50]</a>.

## Speculative Bets and Risk Management

While the core strategy is long-term, some speculative bets are made for opportunistic gains during bullish periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:00">[56:17:00]</a>.
*   **Memecoins:** While risky, some fundamental analysis can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>. They offer high beta exposure to underlying L1s (e.g., Pepe for ETH, Bonk for SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:23:00">[55:23:00]</a>. These are not considered long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09:00">[56:09:00]</a>.
*   **Low-Float Tokens (e.g., Worldcoin):** These can move significantly with less capital due to limited circulating supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. However, they come with high risk due to potential future unlocks and inflation from early investors/foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Exit Strategy for High-Beta Assets
> High-beta, low-float tokens are best held during a bull cycle and actively exited before a bear market to avoid dilution from unlocks and persistent selling pressure from early investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

## Long-Term vs. Tactical Investments

The overarching strategy is to play a long-term accumulation game across crypto networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. This involves:
*   **Scaling Out:** Gradually taking profits by scaling out of positions as the market heats up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.
*   **Cash Position:** Ending the bull run in a stronger cash position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
*   **Re-accumulation in Bear Market:** Using the cash reserve to buy back into fundamental assets during the next bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.
*   **Unyielding Core Holdings:** Maintaining a long-term base of Bitcoin that is not intended to be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. The focus for long-term conviction also extends to understanding "alt L1s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

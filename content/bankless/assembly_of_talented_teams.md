The effectiveness of leaders like Elon Musk is significantly attributed to their ability to assemble highly talented teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This process is not instant but rather a long-term endeavor.

## The Process of Team Assembly
It is suggested that one cannot simply "create an Elon overnight," as his individual effectiveness is the product of decades of experience and compounding work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key, often underappreciated, aspect of his current effectiveness is his success in assembling a collective of approximately 20 highly talented individuals over the past 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. These individuals are considered some of the most talented humans globally, encountered perhaps only a couple of times per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Developing a deep understanding of a person's true potential and reliability within a team can take a decade of testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Characteristics of Effective Teams
In [[key_personnel_in_elon_musks_companies | Elon Musk's companies]], there are typically around five exceptionally talented individuals per company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Examples include Mark Josa at SpaceX and Steve Davis at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These team members possess a "mind meld," allowing them to work together without needing to speak to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This kind of team building, akin to [[building_effective_organizational_structures | building an organism]] that is self-sustaining and maximally evolved for effectiveness, cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It literally takes about 20 years to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

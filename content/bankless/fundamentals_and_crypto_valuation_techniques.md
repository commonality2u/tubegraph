The Bankless podcast often features Michael Nato, founder of The DeFi Report, to discuss [[analyzing_crypto_assets_through_onchain_data_and_indicators | crypto fundamentals]] and what is truly happening in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. These discussions, released monthly on the last Tuesday of every month, focus on a fundamentals analysis of the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## The Quest for Crypto Fundamentals

Michael Nato has been working since 2021 to understand how value is generated through crypto networks, emphasizing the need to be deeply engaged with data and think uniquely about [[concept_of_rev_and_rsov_in_crypto_valuation | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The concept of [[real_economic_value_rev_in_cryptocurrency | Real Economic Value (REV)]] in crypto has become a hot topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

The crypto market is seen as being in its early stages regarding fundamentals, comparable to the early U.S. equities market in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. At that time, there was no concept of fundamental [[concept_of_rev_and_rsov_in_crypto_valuation | valuation]] for stocks; they traded primarily on narratives and "animal spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The idea of discounted cash flow (DCF), introduced by Benjamin Graham in the 1930s, eventually became a social construct that the market converged on as the best way to value equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

For crypto, a consensus on [[concept_of_rev_and_rsov_in_crypt_valuation | valuation]] metrics has not yet formed, with much of the market driven by speculation and relative [[concept_of_rev_and_rsov_in_crypt_valuation | valuation]] against Bitcoin as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Mike Nato believes that the future of crypto [[concept_of_rev_and_rsov_in_crypt_valuation | valuation]] will involve a combination of cash flow and other key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. The goal of these monthly episodes is to aggressively discover and achieve consensus on what constitutes [[analyzing_crypto_assets_through_onchain_data_and_indicators | crypto fundamentals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Fundamentals from Technical Analysis

Michael Nato differentiates his approach from traditional technical analysis (TA), which he views as more short-term focused on resistance areas and breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He considers moving averages as momentum indicators, particularly focusing on longer-term ones (like the 200-week moving average for Bitcoin) for higher signals of fair value and cycle confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. While not strictly fundamental, these indicators provide important context and an "awareness of what's happening in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This is then paired with [[analyzing_crypto_assets_through_onchain_data_and_indicators | onchain data]] (like DEX volumes or animal spirits onchain) and macro analysis to build conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Investment Horizon

A core philosophy for Michael Nato and Bankless is a longer-term investment horizon, similar to Warren Buffett's buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. He advises against seeking to "get rich quick" and instead encourages deep understanding of crypto assets to determine fair value, build conviction, and hold assets for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. His style involves continually monitoring data to understand where the market is in its cycle and combining that with fundamental analysis of specific assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

## Macro Catalysts for Crypto Market

Michael Nato observes several macro factors influencing the crypto market:

*   **Shift from Austerity to Fiscal Spending**: Initially bearish on austerity policies, his view shifted to bullish as it became clear that the U.S. government would continue fiscal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. A large government deficit acts as a surplus of printed money flowing into the economy, driving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: He notes the growing importance of the fiscal side of policy, seeing the Treasury as being in the driver's seat rather than the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Legislation**: The potential passage of the stablecoin bill is considered "huge" and bullish for crypto, as it could allow for more debt issuance through stablecoins, thereby injecting liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. He correlates this with the 2021 alt season, which kicked off after an OCC ruling related to stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

While short-term concerns like tariff pauses and upcoming economic data (labor, CPI) in the summer months could lead to corrections, the overall environment is seen as "risk-on" due to continued fiscal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Policy makers are aware of market reactions and are developing ways to manage Treasury issuance without disrupting the bond market, such as potential changes to the supplemental leverage ratio to allow banks to hold more Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Onchain Data and Indicators

Michael Nato utilizes various [[analyzing_crypto_assets_through_onchain_data_and_indicators | onchain data]] metrics to assess market conditions:

*   **Bitcoin Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day)**:
    *   **Death Cross**: When the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day, it's a backward-looking signal of a price collapse, often followed by a pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Golden Cross**: When the 50-day moves above the 200-day, it signifies a bullish pattern. It can indicate an aggressive upward move, sometimes leading to a short-term correction due to the swift gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing its 50-day moving average trying to make a run towards the 200-day, potentially indicating a golden cross around $3K+ in the coming weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Holder Supply (Bitcoin)**: This metric helps understand market cycle positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
    *   At market peaks or when the market is heating up, the long-term holder supply (those holding Bitcoin for >155 days) starts to crest, indicating that long-term holders are selling their coins to short-term holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
    *   Long-term holders typically set the market bottom by buying dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
    *   Recent data shows long-term holders returning after a correction, suggesting that momentum is building and they are just beginning to take some profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

*   **MVRV z-score**: This Glassnode metric compares market value (current price) to realized value (the average cost basis of all Bitcoins on the network), adjusted by standard deviations (z-score) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   It indicates if the market is overheating; higher z-scores suggest euphoria or bubbly conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   The z-score shows a "law of diminishing returns," sloping downwards over time as Bitcoin becomes a larger, more mature asset, meaning market value can't separate from realized value as drastically as in early cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   Currently at 2.8, it was over 7 in 2021 and almost 12 in earlier cycles, implying there's still room for upward movement, potentially reaching a z-score of 5, consistent with a $180K Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   A rising MVRV z-score implies greater incentive for long-term holders to sell or rotate into other assets, driving "alt season" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Alt Season Dynamics

Alt season is defined as a period where over 50% of new capital entering crypto flows into assets outside of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Historically, Bitcoin leads the market, and altcoins follow, with a key inflection point typically occurring in the last year of a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. While history doesn't exactly repeat, human behavior does, leading to predictable patterns of rotation as [[investor_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investors]] seek larger gains further out the risk curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

The ETH to Bitcoin ratio, which has been trending down, recently showed a tick-up, with ETH having a "teleport moment" of 50% gain in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18">[49:18]</a>. This suggests ETH is poised to gain ground on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18">[49:18]</a>.

Michael Nato believes the probabilities point to an alt season "melt-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:59">[49:59]</a>. However, he cautions that asset selection will be critical, unlike previous cycles where "everything just went off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33">[50:33]</a>. The market is more sophisticated now, requiring focus on assets with strong fundamentals or high attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33">[50:33]</a>. Ethereum is expected to be a key beneficiary of alt season due to its prior negative sentiment, with a potential to outperform Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51">[51:51]</a>.

## Michael Nato's Portfolio and Strategy

Michael Nato typically maintains a larger cash position than most, at least 10%, currently around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30">[53:30]</a>. His strategy involves:

*   **Accumulation**: Being very bullish and accumulating assets post-FTX (late 2022/early 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47">[53:47]</a>.
*   **Rotation**: Selling assets and building a cash position during market peaks (like Dec/Jan 2024), then buying back into corrections, moving further out on the risk curve as alt season builds conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31">[54:31]</a>.
*   **Current Allocation**: Roughly 60% of his crypto portfolio is in Bitcoin, with the remainder split into ETH ecosystem assets (including ETH) and other riskier plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51">[54:51]</a>.
*   **Beta Bets**: He expresses views on Layer 1 blockchains (L1s) through their "culture coins" (memecoins) for amplified upside. Examples include Pepe for the ETH ecosystem and Bonk for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:08">[55:08]</a>. While highly speculative and not long-term investments, these are used for fun and curiosity to deeply understand market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07">[56:07]</a>.
*   **Other Bets**: Celestia (a bet on the DA space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34">[57:34]</a> and Worldcoin (potential AI play, noting its high blob payments to L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53">[57:53]</a>. Worldcoin is a low-float token, meaning less capital is needed to move it, but it carries the risk of significant inflation and unlocks from early investors during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18">[58:18]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy**: The general plan is to scale out of positions during the bull run to build a stronger cash position, enabling repurchasing fundamental assets during the next bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. He maintains some long-term Bitcoin which he will "never sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## Valuation Framework (Triple Point Asset)

Michael Nato proposes a multi-faceted approach to valuing crypto assets, viewing them as a "triple point asset" with three primary categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>:

1.  **Capital Asset**: Characterized by real yields (e.g., from MEV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
2.  **Commodity Asset**: Based on its utility or consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
3.  **Store of Value Asset**: Its ability to retain value over time, similar to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

Additionally, he notes potential elements like GDP contribution, asset security, and a "monetary premium" derived from a project's brand and community ("how big of a cult do you have?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

An example of deep fundamental research is analyzing Solana's MEV infrastructure to understand the durability of value accrual to Solana (SOL) holders via Jito (JTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. This research aims to determine if MEV is a durable source of value or merely related to memecoin speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

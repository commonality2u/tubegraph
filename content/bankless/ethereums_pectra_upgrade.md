The [[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] upgrade, [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]]'s 19th hard fork, went live on mainnet last night or last morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The implementation was "extremely smooth" and "went off without a hitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This was [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]]'s largest hard fork to date by the sheer number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

The upgrade significantly focused on improving user experience (UX) and scaling blobs, which are crucial for Layer 2 networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

## Key EIPs in Pectra

[[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] introduced several important EIPs, with three considered flagship features:

### EIP 7691: Increased Blob Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
This EIP doubled the target capacity for blobs within each [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] block from three to six, with a maximum of nine blobs per block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
> [!INFO] Significance for Layer 2s
> Blobs serve as a "fast lane" for Layer 2 data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. This doubling of blob space acts as a subsidy for Layer 2s, allowing them to:
> *   Consume more [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] Layer 1 blob space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
> *   Process transactions faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
> *   Support a greater number of Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
> This leads to a higher equilibrium for the aggregate amount of transactions across the [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] Layer 2 economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### EIP 7251: Increased Max Effective Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>
Previously, [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] stakers could only stake 32 ETH per validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This EIP allows stakers to consolidate multiple validators into a single validator instance, supporting balances between 32 and 48 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

This EIP allows externally owned addresses (EOAs) to temporarily gain smart contract properties during a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. The EOA reverts to its original state by the end of the transaction, with the process happening seamlessly behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

It also lays the groundwork for features like native social recovery and session keys, potentially ending "wallet sprawl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

## [[Ethereum Roadmap and Future Upgrades | Ethereum Roadmap]] and Future Priorities

The simplified roadmap for [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] in 2025 and beyond is to "scale the Layer 1, scale blobs, [and] improve UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. While [[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] delivered on UX and blob scaling, it lacked explicit Layer 1 throughput increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

The next planned upgrade, Fusaka, targeted for the end of this year, will introduce "Pur-Dass" (Pure Data Availability Sampling), which will significantly increase blob space (potentially 10x more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

Ongar noted that in 2025, [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]]'s execution throughput is up 20% while data availability (DA) throughput is up 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. He anticipates a path to 1000% increases in both execution and DA over the next 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. However, there's a recognized imbalance in prioritizing blob space over Layer 1 block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

### Call for Layer 1 Scaling

Justin Drake tweeted about configuring his node for a 60 million gas limit (up from the current 36 million and recent 30 million), representing a 66% bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. This is a post-[[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] capability, as the Layer 1 gas limit can be voted on and dictated by validators without a hard fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

Beyond block size, there is a strong argument for reducing Layer 1 block times (currently 12 seconds) to 8 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This would require an EIP and lead to:
*   Faster trading speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   Smaller amounts of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   Tighter spreads for market makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   Overall more efficient DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

While Pur-Dass is already established for Fusaka, the next hard fork after Fusaka, potentially called "Clamsterdam," is anticipated to focus on Layer 1 improvements and potentially include a time decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.# [[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade]]

## [[Ethereum Roadmap and Future Upgrades | Ethereum Roadmap]] and Future Priorities

The simplified roadmap for [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]] in 2025 and beyond is to "scale the Layer 1, scale blobs, [and] improve UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. While [[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] delivered on UX and blob scaling, it lacked explicit Layer 1 throughput increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

The next planned upgrade, Fusaka, targeted for the end of this year, will introduce "Pur-Dass" (Pure Data Availability Sampling), which will significantly increase blob space (potentially 10x more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

Ongar noted that in 2025, [[ethereum_roadmap_and_future_upgrades | Ethereum]]'s execution throughput is up 20% while data availability (DA) throughput is up 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. He anticipates a path to 1000% increases in both execution and DA over the next 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. However, there's a recognized imbalance in prioritizing blob space over Layer 1 block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

### Call for Layer 1 Scaling

Justin Drake tweeted about configuring his node for a 60 million gas limit (up from the current 36 million and recent 30 million), representing a 66% bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. This is a post-[[ethereum_pectra_upgrade_and_its_implications | Pectra]] capability, as the Layer 1 gas limit can be voted on and dictated by validators without a hard fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

Beyond block size, there is a strong argument for reducing Layer 1 block times (currently 12 seconds) to 8 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This would require an EIP and lead to:
*   Faster trading speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   Smaller amounts of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   Tighter spreads for market makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   Overall more efficient DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

While Pur-Dass is already established for Fusaka, the next hard fork after Fusaka, potentially called "Clamsterdam," is anticipated to focus on Layer 1 improvements and potentially include a time decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

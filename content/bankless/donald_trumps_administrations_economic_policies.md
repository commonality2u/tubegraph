Lynn Alden, a go-to resource for navigating macro markets, discusses the economic climate under [[donald_trumps_impact_on_the_global_order | Donald Trump]]'s administration, focusing on fiscal policy, trade, and the dollar.

## Macroeconomic Outlook and Fiscal Dominance
The year 2025 is anticipated to be a potentially more volatile year for risk assets due to a potential trend change. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> The current administration is seen as favorable toward Bitcoin and crypto, suggesting potential upside surprises in regulations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

The overarching theme is "fiscal dominance," meaning that government fiscal policy (spending, borrowing, deficits) takes precedence over Central Bank monetary policy (interest rates, quantitative easing/tightening). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> This implies that those running fiscal policy significantly influence the economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> The Federal Reserve's monetary actions are considered "in the backseat" compared to fiscal policy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

### Shift in Economic Environment
There's a potential pivot point in the macroeconomic environment. For almost two years (since early 2023), the Fed has been tightening and draining liquidity, while the Treasury has been injecting liquidity back in through large deficits and shortening the average duration of debt by issuing extra T-bills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> This dynamic is nearing its end as there isn't much money left in the reverse repo facility, suggesting a potential shake-up between the Treasury and the Fed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>

The new administration brings a "new agenda" and different policies related to fiscal policy and global markets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> The first 100 days and first two years of a presidency are particularly significant for introducing disruptive policies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> Unlike his first term, [[donald_trumps_impact_on_the_global_order | Trump]]'s current team is more aligned and "anti-establishment," having planned their transition to "hit the ground running." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

## Trade Deficits and [[us_manufacturing_and_economic_strategies | US Manufacturing]]
[[donald_trumps_impact_on_the_global_order | Donald Trump]] is keen on reducing the trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> This resonates with voters in "Rust Belt" manufacturing areas that flipped for him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>

The US trade deficit differs from most countries due to the dollar's unique "monetary premium." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> Countries globally hold dollar-denominated assets for value storage, creating persistent extra demand for the dollar. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> This structurally overvalues the dollar on a trade basis, giving the US greater import power and less competitiveness in low-margin physical exports. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

Maintaining the dollar as the world's reserve currency, which allows the US government to issue more debt and deficits, requires supplying the world with dollars, leading to a structural trade deficit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> However, decades of trade deficits hollow out the industrial base, creating winners (e.g., in D.C., New York, Silicon Valley) and losers (e.g., Midwest/Rust Belt). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a> Reversing this trend will require significant sacrifices and likely cause disruptions to global finance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>

## [[trumps_tariff_strategy_and_its_impacts | Trump's Tariff Strategy]] and the Dollar
[[donald_trumps_impact_on_the_global_order | Trump]]'s statements on the dollar are often conflicting, but his clear objective is to reduce the trade deficit and bring manufacturing home, using aggressive tactics like tariffs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> His administration aims to keep the dollar as the global reserve currency while addressing the trade imbalance, a perceived conflict. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>

Stephen Miran, a nominated economic advisor, suggests policies might lead to initial dollar strength followed by later dollar weakening. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> There's discussion of potential intentional dollar weakening or devaluation, possibly as part of trade negotiations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a> This could involve disincentivizing other countries from holding US assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>

The dollar has been in a strong cycle for about 10 years, with the DXY (Dollar Strength Index) currently around 108. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a> This strength is partly attributed to the US economy's robustness and "own goals" from other major economies (e.g., Canada's energy policies, Europe's energy policies, China's property bubble and big tech crackdown). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a> The recent post-election dollar surge is linked to expectations of looser fiscal policy, higher inflation expectations, and a more hawkish Fed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>

### The Idea of a "Plaza Accord 2.0"
The concept of a "Plaza Accord 2.0" (jokingly referred to as the "Mar-a-Lago Accord") has gained traction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a> The original Plaza Accord in the 1980s was a coordinated devaluation of the dollar to address trade imbalances. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a> A similar agreement could buy time with the US national debt by devaluing it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>

A strong dollar generally means foreigners reduce buying US debt, leading to liquidity issues (e.g., 2020 treasury market breakdown). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a> Weakening the dollar eases debt burdens for [[emerging_market_dynamics_in_the_us_under_trump | emerging markets]], potentially boosting US asset prices and economic growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a> However, a significant cost is persistent inflation, as a weaker dollar can lead to higher energy and import prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>

### Impact of Inflation and Healthcare Costs
Globalization was largely disinflationary, making supply chains efficient but pressuring US wages and manufacturing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a> Reversing this could boost American wages and manufacturing but come with inflation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>

A structural fix for [[us_manufacturing_and_economic_strategies | US manufacturing]] also requires addressing the US's significantly higher per capita healthcare costs, which burden employers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a> Without tackling healthcare, reshoring efforts may be expensive and limited. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a> The US's energy security and relatively inexpensive energy offer some offset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>

## Trump's Policy Priorities and Interest Rates
[[donald_trumps_impact_on_the_global_order | Trump]] has consistently favored lower long-term interest rates, partly due to his background as a real estate investor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> His administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, aims to reduce long-term rates through policies like energy dominance and deregulation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>

The Treasury can influence interest rates by deciding the duration of debt issued. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a> Issuing more short-duration T-bills instead of long-duration bonds can lower long-term yields. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a> The Treasury also has extraordinary powers, like revaluing gold holdings for a "burst of money," though this is a "break the glass" move. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>

Another lever is pressuring the Fed to accommodate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a> Historically, central banks have folded when sovereign bond markets face issues to maintain system stability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> The administration can also influence the Fed by appointing more sympathetic chairs when terms are up. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>

## Monetary Policy and Liquidity Outlook
Inflation remains sticky, and consumer expectations for inflation are higher. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a> The long end of the yield curve has been unusually hawkish despite Fed rate cuts, meaning borrowing costs for mortgages and business loans haven't significantly eased. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>

The reverse repo facility, which held over $2 trillion in excess QE, is now almost depleted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a> This means the Treasury's "anti-QT" by tapping these funds to offset the Fed's quantitative tightening is ending. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a> When this buffer runs out, likely in the back half of 2025, the Fed may need to stop balance sheet reduction and move to a flat or increasing balance sheet, or ease regulations for banks to hold more treasuries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>

The Fed aims to avoid a repeat of the 2019 repo spike where they tightened until something broke. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a> They typically monitor liquidity strains at the end of each quarter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a> It is anticipated they will end treasury reductions on their balance sheet but continue selling mortgage-backed securities to normalize the balance sheet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>

The next two years are expected to be "moderately good for liquidity" but with "more bumps" than since the Regional Bank crisis of early 2023. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>

## Geopolitical Interest in Bitcoin
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent freezing of its reserves, global central banks have shown increased "friction" around the dollar and treasury. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> This has prompted them to diversify fiat exchange reserves or hold more "neutral" reserve assets like gold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>

Some "forward-thinking" central banks are now considering Bitcoin, moving beyond the "ludicrous" idea it once was. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a> Examples include El Salvador and Bhutan stacking Bitcoin at a sovereign level. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a> The Czech National Bank is even considering incorporating Bitcoin into its foreign exchange reserves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>

As a neutral reserve asset that protects against seizure and offers efficient value transfer (compared to flying gold across borders), Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> The fact that [[trump_branded_cryptocurrency | Trump]] and people in his circle are talking about Bitcoin reduces "career risk" for other countries and entities to consider it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>

Domestically, conversations about a US Bitcoin/crypto treasury are happening, with figures like David Sachs (a "crypto czar") researching it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a> This domestic interest can prompt external countries to "front run" or follow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a> While a full-scale bill like Cynthia Lummis's may not be a base case, the "nonzero possibilities" for pro-crypto actions (like ending capital gains taxes on certain assets after a period of time) make the overall probability curve for Bitcoin better under this administration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>

## Broader Economic Factors
Overall, while there are "yellow and orange flags," particularly around tariffs, the current macro environment is described as "reasonable" with "no red flags" and "no orange flags." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>

Energy policy remains a significant factor to watch, with potential disruptions from geopolitical actions in regions like Iran or Venezuela, or domestic policies encouraging drilling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a> However, tariffs are considered the most consequential factor for broad asset prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>

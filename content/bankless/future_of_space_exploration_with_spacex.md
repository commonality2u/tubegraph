For approximately 30 to 40 years, [[stagnation_in_space_technology | space technology]] did not see much progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This long period of stagnation created a bad intuition about the field's potential for exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[cost_reduction_in_space_transport | Cost Reduction in Space Transport]]

Historically, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained stalled at around $100,000 for roughly 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. SpaceX aims to drastically reduce this cost with Starship, pushing it down to approximately $20 per kilogram once it is fully reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an astonishing 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_space_transport | reduction in cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[increase_in_payload_capacity_for_space | Increased Payload Capacity]]

Beyond just cost, the amount of material that can be sent into space has historically been very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within the next 10 years, there is an expectation to be able to put a million times more material into space per year than was possible 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This signifies a massive [[increase_in_payload_capacity_for_space | increase in payload capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Transformative Impact

The combination of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold increase in the amount of material that can be sent into space is compared to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This shift is likened to moving from dangerous horse-drawn carriages, which carried a high risk of death or disease across America, to the ability to easily, comfortably, and cheaply transport extremely large amounts of goods by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This transformation signifies the emergence of a "railroad to space," fundamentally changing the landscape of [[space_exploration_and_its_societal_benefits | space exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

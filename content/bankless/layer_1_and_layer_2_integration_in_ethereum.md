The Ethereum ecosystem, envisioned as a programmable internet money and a DeFi economy, faces challenges in its current approach to [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 1 (L1)]] and [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Layer 2 (L2)]] integration. A reorientation is proposed to restore Ethereum's position as the primary economic hub and elevate Ether (ETH) as a global money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## The Challenge: A Fractured Ecosystem

Historically, Ethereum L1 served as the undisputed economic hub of the internet, attracting users, developers, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. This created a positive feedback loop: users attracted developers, who built applications, which attracted more users, generating gas fees and protocol revenue, all feeding back into the value of Ether as a unit of account and a money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

However, the strategic prioritization of [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] led to a different outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>:
*   **Severed Feedback Loop** The ecosystem shifted from L1 directly to L2s, encouraging users to "get off mainnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. This broke the positive feedback loop, as L2s developed their own network effects, rather than extending Ethereum's L1 network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Independent L2s** Each [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2]] aims to attract users to itself, leading to fragmentation rather than a cohesive network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **"Articles of Confederation" Analogy** Ethereum's current state is compared to the post-Revolutionary War United States under the Articles of Confederation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The L2s act like 13 separate states or nations, each with its own currency and borders, forming a loose "security alliance" rather than a unified entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. L2s can swap out Ethereum's data availability layer or leave the network at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   **Loss of Economic Alignment** When DeFi activity shifts off L1, the "money-ness" of Ether is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. L2s often introduce their own tokens for fees or governance, further fracturing the monetary power of ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Stagnation of L1** While L2s grow, the Ethereum L1 has remained relatively stagnant in size as an economic hub, leading to concerns about its ability to compete in a crowded smart contract platform market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Restoring Ethereum's Economic Hub

To "finish the job" and enable Ethereum to win, a strategic pivot towards a product-centric roadmap is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This involves:

### 1. Scaling and Prioritizing Layer 1

The Ethereum L1 must be expanded and re-emphasized as the core economic hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Maximize L1 Throughput:** [[Scaling Ethereum layer 1 and layer 2 improvements | Scale the L1]] as far as possible, aiming for a 100x throughput increase within two years, while preserving its core properties of censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Bring Activity Back to L1:** Promote L1 as the primary destination for DeFi, tokenized assets, applications, and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. Ensure fees remain as low as possible on L1 to accommodate this growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.

### 2. Achieving Deeper L2 Integration

The relationship between L1 and L2s needs to evolve from a loose alliance to a seamless, integrated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **"Based" and "Native" Rollups:** Invest in research and development of "based" and "native" rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. These rollups are more tightly integrated with the Ethereum L1, sharing sequencing and execution, and can even be tokenless and governanceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Seamless User Experience:** In "based" and "native" rollups, the distinction between L1 and L2 blurs significantly. Users experience seamless transitions, like moving between states on an interstate highway, without needing "passports" or different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Interoperability Standards:** Develop robust interoperability standards to ensure heavy integration of all L2 extensions with the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### 3. Fostering Economic Alignment and "Ethereum Nationalism"

A strong sense of collective identity and economic alignment is crucial for the long-term success of the "United Chains of Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.
*   **L2 Treasury Holdings:** Encourage L2s to hold a significant portion (e.g., 10-20%) of their treasuries in Ether, demonstrating investment in the broader Ethereum economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **ETH as Transaction Fees:** L2s should accept transaction fees in ETH, reinforcing its role as the primary currency across the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   **Promoting ETH:** L2s should integrate ETH prominently in wallets and dashboards, and actively help evangelize Ether as a store of value to the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing Integration:** The shift to "based" and "native" rollups should be driven by economic self-interest, making it highly appealing for L2s to integrate more tightly with the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.
*   **Strong L1 as Magnet:** A stronger L1 will attract more chains to join, as networks prefer to ally with winners who offer deep liquidity and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.

### 4. Shifting the Narrative

The Ethereum community's messaging needs to evolve to support these strategic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.
*   **"Ethereum for Everyone and Everything"** Promote the Ethereum L1 as capable of accommodating all users, builders, traders, speculators, and use cases, including memecoins and tokenized Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **End "Purity Testing"** The community should stop "gerrymandering support" around use cases it finds distasteful or immoral. Embracing permissionlessness means not policing what happens on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. Speculators and traders are crucial "bootloaders" for new applications and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   **ETH as a Commodity Money Backed by an Economy** Frame Ether not as a cash-flowing equity, but as an index of the entire Ethereum economyâ€”a programmable commodity money backed by an onchain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This narrative emphasizes the vast Total Addressable Market (TAM) of a decentralized, internet-native economy built on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

By implementing these changes, particularly by strengthening the L1 and tightly integrating L2s, Ethereum can restore its product-money feedback loop, solidify its position as the economic hub of the internet, and elevate Ether to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Bitcoin]] as a globally valued crypto money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

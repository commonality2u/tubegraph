The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is focused on several key strategic priorities and an accelerated cadence for future network upgrades and hard forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## Overview of Strategic Priorities

The [[ethereums_strategic_roadmap | Ethereum strategic roadmap]] for future development revolves around three main objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>:

> [!INFO] **Three Core Objectives**
> 1.  [[ethereum_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>
> 2.  Scaling blobs for Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>
> 3.  Improving user experience (UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:38">[02:30:38]</a>

These points collectively represent [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_future_potential | Ethereum turning itself into a product]] it aims to offer the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:12">[04:20:12]</a>, particularly as institutions look to deploy and buy blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:33">[04:27:33]</a>. Improving UX includes enhancing interoperability standards for Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:38">[03:57:38]</a>, focusing on security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:44">[05:28:44]</a>, and improving block latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:23">[06:01:23]</a>. It also extends to developer experience (DevX), ensuring builders have excellent tooling, roadmap clarity, and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:34">[06:25:34]</a>. The goal is to make Ethereum a "global neutral layer for all the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>, aiming for it to be as foundational as the internet is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>.

## Accelerated Upgrade Cadence

Historically, Ethereum hard forks have occurred every 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. Under the new leadership, the [[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | Ethereum roadmap and upgrades]] are planned to be shipped every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. This accelerated cadence aims to provide more operational capacity to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>, address inefficiencies, and improve communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>. The EF wants to be dynamic and adjust based on expectations, with changes having immediate and long-term impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.

## Upcoming Hard Forks

### Pectra

Pectra is the next hard fork after Dencun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, scheduled for May 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. Key features include:
*   Changes to staking with max effective balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a>.
*   Massive UX improvements via EIP-3074, which introduces account abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.

### Fuzaka

Fuzaka is planned for September and October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
*   **Execution Layer Object Format (EOF)**: While some initially believed EOF was removed from Pectra, it was actually a discussion for Fuzaka, a fork still six months out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. The decision to remove EOF from Fuzaka's planned features has caused frustration among developers who spent thousands of hours on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This highlights a "lack of capacity to decide" within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. The EF recognizes the need to bring application developers into the early planning stages of EIPs to avoid such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.
*   The goal is to accelerate Fuzaka to a five-month timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>, ensuring no delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. Devnets for Fuzaka will start immediately after Pectra's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.

### Glamsterdam

Glamsterdam is projected for March to June of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. It will focus on further [[ethereum_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | L1 scaling acceleration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>. Some scaling improvements can be implemented without a hard fork, while others will require EIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Metrics

The new co-executive directors, Shiae Wong and Tomas Stanjac, aim to bring "founder energy" and operational efficiency to the EF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>. They plan to focus on speed of execution, accountability, and clear goals with trackable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. An overarching metric for [[ethereum_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | Ethereum scaling]] is a 100x improvement over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, starting with a 3x increase this year and a 10x increase next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. This target requires restructuring protocol development and research efforts around this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

The EF also aims to improve communication about the [[ethereums_roadmap_and_future_potential | roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a> and encourage wider participation from the community, including DeFi builders and application developers, in shaping the protocol's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>. The goal is to avoid an "ivory tower" perception and ensure the EF is connected to true user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

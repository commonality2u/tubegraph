The cryptocurrency industry has long grappled with the volatile and often criticized nature of [[impact_of_memecoins_on_the_crypto_market | meme coins]], which have been associated with "inert nature" and "destructive Market behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Despite this, there is a burgeoning discussion around their potential to evolve into more productive and sustainable financial assets within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## The Problem with Past Meme Coin Cycles

Historically, the launch and trading of [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] have often resulted in "a trail of destroyed Capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. What began as innocent speculation sometimes transformed into "structural and systematized extraction into the hands of just a few players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This period has significantly [[criticisms_and_reputational_challenges_of_meme_coins | tarnished crypto's reputation]] in the mainstream, drawing comparisons to manipulative industries like big tobacco due to concerns about their inherent potential for "toxic outcomes for its users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> and the risk of being stuck "creating only toxic outcomes for its users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Before platforms like Pump Fun, the process of launching [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]] was unregulated and risky, often involving pre-sales where individuals would send funds to a wallet address, with no guarantee of the coin being launched or protection against scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Such practices frequently led to "total sâ€”t show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> scenarios, including "honey pots" and liquidity pulls that drained users' wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Meme Coins as a Natural Evolution of Crypto

Despite the challenges, [[the_cultural_and_economic_implications_of_meme_coins | meme coins]] are seen by some as a "logical conclusion of what crypto brings to humanity: the permissionless ability to create a financial asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The market for [[the_role_of_meme_coins_and_celebrity_influence_in_cryptocurrency | meme coins]] has evolved significantly over the past decade, from initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) "food coins" to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all of which involved trading culture and building communities around ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Pump Fun played a critical role in expanding the meme coin sector by simplifying participation and establishing a baseline level of security for coin creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. It significantly lowered the barrier to entry, making it possible to create a coin without committing capital upfront, instead using a bonding curve model to bootstrap liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This mechanism allows a token to be launched and its liquidity pool burned, making it "truly permissionless [and] truly immutable" once created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Shifting Towards Sustainability: Pump Swap and Creator Revenue Sharing

A key future direction for [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] lies in improving their underlying mechanisms to foster sustainability and align incentives. The introduction of Pump Swap, Pump Fun's native decentralized exchange (DEX), aims to simplify the on-chain experience and reduce friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. This includes slashing migration fees to zero, aligning the protocol with users by taking a small transaction fee only when tokens succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

Crucially, Pump Swap plans to implement Creator Revenue Sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This feature is designed to address the fundamental misalignment of incentives where creators previously profited by selling their tokens, often at the expense of later buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. With Creator Revenue Sharing, creators will earn a portion of the swap volumes, incentivizing them to "keep their coin in the news, keep it relevant for as long as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. This model can transform [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] from "inert Financial assets into sustainable businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, driven by economic growth rather than short-term speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

## Cultural Considerations and Moderation

The [[the_cultural_and_economic_implications_of_meme_coins | cultural and economic implications of meme coins]] are significant. The "4chan aesthetic" adopted by Pump Fun was initially a practical choice but was retained because it resonated with users who originated [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] on such forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. However, this aesthetic has also been linked to "nefarious behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>, prompting discussions on the importance of moderation and setting clear cultural boundaries from the top down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

Effective moderation at scale is challenging but necessary, involving both automated systems and manual review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. The removal of features like live streaming, which saw an influx of problematic content, demonstrates how platforms can influence user behavior towards more sustainable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. The focus is now on incentivizing and rewarding positive behavior, highlighting projects that build real utility, even if they leverage [[the_role_of_meme_coins_and_celebrity_influence_in_cryptocurrency | meme coins]] for distribution and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Future Vision for Meme Coins

The future of [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] aims to move beyond a "nihilist speculative asset" perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. The goal is to build products that "survive multiple Cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a> and ensure users gain value from their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This involves:

*   **Incentivizing Quality Content:** Creator Revenue Sharing encourages higher quality projects and sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.
*   **Broadening Accessibility:** Bringing diverse assets and tokens to users who may not engage with centralized exchanges, fostering greater exploration beyond just [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Enhancing Social Elements:** Recognizing crypto as inherently social, future developments will lean into social features to make the experience more entertaining and valuable, attracting users who are there for fun and community, not just financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   **Measuring Attention and Relevance:** [[Influence of meme coins on AI crypto agents | Meme coins]] can act as "attention units," providing quantifiable metrics for how trending certain topics are, effectively allowing news to unfold on-chain in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>.

The challenge for the future is to flip the narrative that trading on-chain is inherently valueless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. While financial value exists, it is underpinned by other forms of value, such as entertainment or the ability to garner attention for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. The aim is to create a "sustainable experience where people are happy to come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>, even if it means less extreme euphoria.

## Conclusion

Despite past criticisms and the perception of [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]] as merely a "casino game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>, their continued existence for over a decade suggests an inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. The future of [[potential_longterm_trends_in_crypto_markets | meme coins]] hinges on building stable, sustainable products that address user behavior, incentivize good content, and continuously iterate to foster a healthier on-chain environment. The goal is to maximize "economic value" by making coin creation accessible and cultivating a community that is happy to participate over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

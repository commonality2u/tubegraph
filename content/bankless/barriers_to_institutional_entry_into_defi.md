Despite growing [[institutional involvement in cryptocurrency | institutional involvement]] and interest, the path for [[traditional finance]] ([[traditional_finance | TradFi]]) firms to fully integrate with [[DeFi]] faces several [[regulatory_and_macro_challenges_in_crypto | challenges]] and bottlenecks. A survey conducted by the Paradigm policy team, polling 300 [[traditional_finance | TradFi]] professionals, shed light on these barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Key Barriers Identified

The primary obstacles preventing deeper [[institutional involvement in cryptocurrency | institutional]] engagement with [[DeFi]] include:

*   **Lack of Regulatory Clarity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>
*   **Concerns about Maturity and Stability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>
*   **Understanding of Decentralization and Public Blockchains** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>

### Regulatory Hurdles

[[Regulatory and macro challenges in crypto | Regulatory clarity]] was identified as a major barrier, with a majority of respondents citing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. While progress is being made by the SEC, the bottleneck extends beyond this single agency. Other regulators, such as the FDIC, OCC, and the Fed, also need to provide clarity for [[role_of_banks_in_crypto_and_defi_protocols | banks]], hedge funds, and credit card companies to access [[DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Currently, these entities are largely allowing access to centralized finance (CeFi) products, but not yet explicitly to [[DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Legislative action on Capitol Hill is primarily focused on CeFi, and there's no existing model for how to regulate [[DeFi]] due to its lack of an analog in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Paradigm expresses concern that regulating [[DeFi]] too soon could be onerous, advocating for a "do no harm" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

### Maturity and Stability Concerns

Financial institutions expressed concerns about the maturity and stability of [[DeFi]] platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. This includes factors like throughput and potential downtime, particularly noted with [[Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. The need for scaling and reduced latency, which leads to [[infrastructure_challenges_in_stablecoins | lower transaction costs]] and faster settlement times, is a key driver for [[traditional_finance | TradFi]]'s interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

The rise of Layer 2s (L2s) on [[Ethereum]] is seen as a potential solution, offering increased scale, lower latency, and customizability that could make them more attractive to [[financial institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

### Perception of Decentralization and Public Blockchains

[[Traditional finance]] entities do not primarily engage with [[public blockchains]] or [[DeFi]] due to abstract principles like decentralization or credible neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. Instead, their interest stems from the "bigness" and economic activity of these ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. They are attracted to [[Ethereum]]'s large economy and [[Solana]]'s recent growth, viewing these as opportunities for efficiency and cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Decentralization is not the primary selling point for [[traditional_finance | TradFi]]. Instead, they are drawn to the *size* and *economic activity* of [[public_blockchains_over_private_blockchains_for_financial_institutions | public blockchains]], which offer [[infrastructure_challenges_in_stablecoins | lower transaction costs]], faster settlement times, and increased transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>.

There is a clear rejection of the notion that [[private blockchains]] are as valuable as [[public blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. While some [[private blockchains]] projects still exist, the growing recognition is that connectivity to [[public blockchains]], their liquidity, and network effects is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. This implies a need for compliance-friendly mechanisms that can interoperate with open, permissionless systems, such as "verified pools" on DEXes like Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

## The Path Forward

Despite the [[regulatory_and_macro_challenges_in_crypto | challenges]], [[institutional involvement in cryptocurrency | institutions]] are actively preparing for a future with [[DeFi]]. Over two-thirds of [[traditional_finance | TradFi]] firms are currently researching or experimenting with [[DeFi]], engaging in activities such as building products, pilot programs, investing in crypto firms, and participating in consortiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

They see [[DeFi]] as critically important to their business in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, with some estimating its critical importance within 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. This indicates that while the "game hasn't started yet" due to the need for regulatory clarity, [[institutional involvement in cryptocurrency | institutions]] are already positioning themselves for rapid progress once that clarity emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

The focus is on [[permissionless_finance_in_defi_vs_traditional_finance | tokenization of assets]] (beyond just [[stablecoins | stablecoins]] to include stocks, bonds, and derivatives), decentralized exchanges (DEXes), and lending/borrowing protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. The drive is to leverage [[DeFi]]'s ability to avoid the "absurd manual costs" and inefficiencies of the traditional financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

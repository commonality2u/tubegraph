## Market Performance and Sentiment

Ethereum's price has seen an increase, with ETH up 2.5% on the week, trading at $2730 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. However, the ETH/BTC ratio continues to look "absolutely terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

The broader crypto market is in a macro bull market, with cycles within cycles, including the recent meme coin cycle that may now deflate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. While some perceive this cycle as confusing or odd, it is typical for those not in the "right thing at the right moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Historically, people sidelined during bullish phases often express doubt or cope, similar to how Bitcoin Maxis viewed DeFi summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

## Development and Roadmap

The upcoming Dencun (also referred to as Petra) upgrade is estimated for early April, contingent on successful testnet forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Two testnet forks, Holesky and Sepolia, are scheduled for February 24th and March 5th respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. While not the largest in terms of impact compared to the Merge, Dencun is significant due to the sheer number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) it includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. Key features in the upgrade include a max effective balance and a blob limit increase, providing more blobs for data availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

In terms of development pace, Ethereum is performing well, with strong research and delivery from core developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. The prioritization of work is considered good, even if roadmap timelines are longer than desired by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

## Market Positioning and Competition

Ethereum faces challenges in its market positioning, primarily due to a lack of coordinated communications and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. Despite the technical prowess and decentralization, there's a need for better narrative alignment within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. The search for a social media manager for the Ethereum account, with 3.7 million followers, highlights a perceived gap in centralized communication efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

Some in the community are questioning whether too much emphasis has been placed on credible neutrality, suggesting a need for a more coordinated, even if less credibly neutral, leadership team to guide the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. This idea is contentious, with Vitalik reportedly not in favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

Historically, Ethereum has operated with an "underdog mentality," facing constant criticism from Bitcoin Maxis who predicted its failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This led to an approach of not engaging with critics and focusing solely on delivering the roadmap and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. However, this strategy is less effective against new competitors like Solana, Monad, and Berachain, which have successfully cultivated strong community followings reminiscent of early Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

### Layer 2s and Fragmentation

The emergence of [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | L2s]] like Base (which recently processed 160 transactions per second with a median fee of 2 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>, and Celo's transition to an Ethereum L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>, signifies the growing importance of scaling solutions. While L2s aim to unify Ethereum's fragmented L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>, they also present a challenge by fragmenting the investment narrative. The "ETH is broken" narrative from an investment standpoint is already present due to the fragmentation of L2 tokens, causing confusion for new entrants regarding which token to buy (e.g., ETH, ARB, or BASE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

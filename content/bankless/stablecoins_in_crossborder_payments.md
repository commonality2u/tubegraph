The development of valuable [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] is currently estimated to be only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The global payments market is enormous, with approximately $200 trillion conducted annually in cross-border transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Currently, only about $50 billion of these cross-border payments are processed using [[the_rise_and_significance_of_stablecoins_in_the_global_economy | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Advantages of Stablecoins for Cross-Border Payments

[[Stablecoins as an Alternative to Traditional Banking | Stablecoins]] are considered functionally and unequivocally superior for cross-border payment use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Once infrastructure challenges are resolved, the vast majority of cross-border payments, particularly within the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market which accounts for roughly 40% of the total, will be better served by [[stablecoins_as_an_alternative_to_traditional_banking | stablecoins]] and stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Current Progress and Challenges

While [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | stablecoin development]] is still in its early stages, significant infrastructure challenges remain to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These include:

*   Compliance concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Ensuring sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Solving "last mile" issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

## Impact on Traditional Financial Systems

Traditional businesses like Wise, which sought to address a significant portion of the cross-border revenue, operate with models that are capital inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They require extensive interconnectivity and operational connectivity with the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These complexities would be unnecessary if transactions were conducted on [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This shift suggests a [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_financial_systems_and_fintech | potential market displacement by stablecoins]], where existing payment providers may either adopt stablecoin technologies themselves or face being supplanted by new solutions leveraging these rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The future indicates a significant role for [[the_future_of_stablecoins_and_implications_for_global_finance | stablecoins in reshaping global finance]], particularly in simplifying and improving cross-border transactions.

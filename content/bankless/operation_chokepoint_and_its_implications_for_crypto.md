Operation Chokepoint 2.0 refers to an alleged effort by US financial regulators to stifle the cryptocurrency industry by pressuring banks to cease doing business with crypto-related companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This initiative, once considered a "crypto conspiracy theory," has now been largely substantiated by internal government communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

## Unveiling the Evidence

Recent unredacted documents and emails reveal that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) actively discouraged banks from engaging with crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Counsel for Coinbase, successfully subpoenaed the federal government, specifically the FDIC, leading to the release of these internal communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

Nick Anthony compiled a thread of egregious FDIC emails demonstrating this pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. The general tone of these messages from regulators to financial institutions was to discourage any involvement in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

Examples of FDIC directives to banks include:
*   "The proposed product is apparently an Avenue for Bank customers to engage in crypto asset activity specifically Bitcoin transactions through a third party Arrangement as a result we respectfully ask you that you pause all crypto related activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.
*   Regarding a bank with 2,800 customers purchasing, selling, and storing Bitcoin: "The FDIC has a number of questions until that review is completed, the bank should not expand this service to any additional customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   "As a result we respectfully ask that you not implement this product while we consider this crypto asset related activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   "Accordingly, until we complete our review, we request that the bank refrain from providing this service to its customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
*   "The bank should not proceed with any crypto asset activity until such time that the FC I has determined the bank's ability to implement the activity in a safe and sound manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

These examples confirm a concerted effort by the FDIC to "choke out crypto" by issuing explicit instructions to banks to halt crypto-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Roles

### Michael Barr
Michael Barr, former Vice Chair for Supervision at the [[Federal Reserve policies and their effect on crypto | Federal Reserve]], resigned with his departure effective February 28th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Barr was known for his stance against banks holding crypto assets on their balance sheets and generally opposed the intersection of banks and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. Senator Cynthia Lummis criticized Barr, stating he "completely failed to fulfill his duties" and enabled Operation Chokepoint 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He was also instrumental in pressuring Silvergate Bank to "voluntarily liquidate" in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

### Other Architects of Chokepoint
According to Nick Carter's "Wanted list," remaining figures associated with Operation Chokepoint 2.0 include Senator Elizabeth Warren, Michael Gibson, and Nellie Lang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Implications and Shifting Political Winds

The exposure of these emails confirms the crypto industry's long-held suspicions about regulatory pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. The absence of explicit public statements from federal agencies connecting banks cutting ties with crypto startups to regulatory guidance previously left the industry relying on anecdotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. These emails provide the "missing link" of direct evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

This uncovering happens at a time of changing political sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   David Sachs, appointed as an "AAR of crypto and AI" (implying a role within the [[Trumps procrypto presidency impacts | Trump administration]]), has publicly stated that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 "needs to be looked at" due to the harm it has caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.
*   Globally, there's a perceived shift towards more crypto-friendly policies. In Canada, the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who presided over the freezing of bank accounts during the trucker protests, may pave the way for Pierre Poilievre, who has pledged to make Canada a "crypto Capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.
*   Even major tech companies like Meta are showing a pivot towards free speech principles, potentially aligning with a broader shift away from restrictive content moderation, akin to moves seen in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

The beginning of May 2025 saw a focus on macroeconomic factors, with discussions highlighting three key catalysts for crypto investors to monitor over the subsequent three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. These include a potential [[global_macroeconomic_factors_affecting_us_markets_and_economy | tariff-driven recession]], [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | American capital flight]], and an [[impact_of_potential_recessions_on_money_printing | increasing global money supply]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

## Tariff-Driven Recession

Concerns about a recession are growing, with PolyMarket pricing the odds of a recession in 2025 at 62% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:02">[06:02:02]</a>. Recent [[us_economic_data_and_market_reactions | Q1 GDP numbers]] were unexpectedly negative, coming in at -0.3% against a consensus of 0.3% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:10">[06:35:10]</a>. This significant miss, by 0.6%, is primarily attributed to the impact of tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:01">[07:03:01]</a>.

A baseline 10% tariff is now generally in place in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:01">[07:27:01]</a>. A next decision point for potential tariff increases with partners like the EU, South Korea, and Switzerland is scheduled for July 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:01">[07:38:01]</a>. A report from Apollo predicts a summer 2025 recession, stemming from an escalating sequence of events initiated by tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:01">[08:11:01]</a>. This sequence includes container ships halting at US ports, followed by a halt in trucking demand in late May, and then layoffs in the trucking and retail industries by early June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:01">[08:23:01]</a>.

A recession is generally perceived as unfavorable for crypto in the short term, as crypto assets are considered "risk-on" assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:01">[08:56:01]</a>.

## American Capital Flight

Signs of [[rebalancing_of_the_global_economy_due_to_us_policies | American capital flight]] are emerging, characterized by declining US stocks and bonds, a weakening dollar, and surging gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:01">[09:20:01]</a>. The historical role of the US as the world's store of value, primarily through its risk-free rates and stock market, appears to be showing signs of reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:01">[09:35:01]</a>.

Despite this, the S&P 500 is only down 4-5% on the year, and the NASDAQ is down 8%, which does not indicate extensive capital flight at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:01">[09:59:01]</a>. However, 10-year US Treasury bond yields remain stubbornly high at 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:01">[10:17:01]</a>. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, has seen a 33% increase on the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:01">[10:36:01]</a>.

Donald Trump's inconsistent statements on the stock market, shifting from claiming it as the "Trump stock market" when polls were good to calling it the "Biden stock market" when tariffs began, highlight the political narratives around economic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:01">[10:41:01]</a>.

The continuation of American capital flight could have mixed effects on crypto. Bitcoin has begun to trade more like gold since the tariff announcements, positioning itself as a sovereign, non-sovereign store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:01">[12:06:01]</a>. This aligns with crypto's long-standing thesis of providing a credibly neutral alternative to fiat monetary systems and traditional property rights systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:01">[12:48:01]</a>. While short-term impacts might be negative due to the potential tariff recession, the long-term outlook (12 months and beyond) appears bullish for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:01">[13:10:01]</a>.

## Increasing Global Money Supply

Another key macroeconomic catalyst is the [[impact_of_potential_recessions_on_money_printing | increasing global money supply]], specifically global M2 liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:01">[13:17:01]</a>. After a cycle of decreasing global monetary liquidity in recent years, a new cycle of increasing M2 is beginning, often seen as a four-year liquidity cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:01">[13:40:01]</a>.

Should a recession occur and capital flight continue, it is anticipated that "money printers" will be activated, leading to further increases in global money supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:01">[14:00:01]</a>. Ray Dalio's perspective, "It's too late. The changes are coming," suggests a new monetary order on the brink, driven by unsustainable fundamentals and a rebalancing of global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:01">[14:07:01]</a>. This rebalancing will cause pain, and governments are expected to print more money to ease this pain, thereby devaluing fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:01">[14:52:01]</a>. This supports the Bitcoiner thesis on monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:01">[15:03:01]</a>. The more governments print and become isolated, the more attractive a credible, neutral, permissionless, and open monetary system (like crypto) becomes, signaling a long-term bullish outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:01">[15:09:01]</a>.

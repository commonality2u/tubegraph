Hardware advancements are fundamentally important as they typically precede and enable software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept highlights the [[relationship_between_hardware_and_software_development | relationship between hardware and software development]], where foundational [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] forms the basis for subsequent software innovations.

## The Principle of Hardware Precedence

This principle is evident across various technological milestones:
*   **Mobile Applications** The development of the App Store and companies like Uber was only possible after the creation of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself relied on decades of [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] development from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, alongside 20 years of building out networks and communications technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Deep Learning** The emergence of deep learning was contingent on the invention and 20 years of progress in the [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | GPU]] (Graphics Processing Unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Hardware Foundations for Cloud Computing

Cloud computing exemplifies this relationship by leveraging specific [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] advancements to offer its services:

*   **Commodity Hardware** The essence of cloud computing is the ability to place a large amount of cheap commodity [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Distributed Systems** On top of this commodity [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]], distributed systems use algorithms to manage failures and breakdowns in a fault-tolerant way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach provides a significant cost advantage over hosting individual, dedicated [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Memory and CPUs** A critical prerequisite for cloud computing's development was over two decades of progress in memory and CPU technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Coinbase recently faced a significant customer data leak, leading to a ransom demand from hackers. The company's CEO, Brian Armstrong, publicly addressed the situation and outlined Coinbase's counter-strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.

## The Breach Details

Hackers demanded $20 million in Bitcoin from Coinbase in exchange for not releasing customer information they claimed to possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. The data breach affected less than 1% of Coinbase's monthly transacting users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. Importantly, this breach did not compromise passwords, private keys, or customer funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>. Instead, the leaked information consisted of personal customer details such as addresses, email, telephone numbers, transaction details, and even government IDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>.

The breach reportedly occurred through Coinbase's support team, with hackers allegedly bribing individual support workers who had access to this sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. This data has been used to enhance phishing attempts against customers, with Coinbase reportedly losing between $300 million to $400 million per year due to such attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.

### Warning for Users
Users are advised to be vigilant about text messages or emails claiming asset transfers have been approved from their Coinbase account. These are likely scams, and Coinbase will not call users or ask them to call a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>. Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) is also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>.

## Coinbase's Response

Coinbase has publicly stated its refusal to pay the $20 million ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. In a "reverse UNO card" move, Brian Armstrong announced a $20 million bounty for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. The company has also pledged to reimburse any users impacted by this breach and is working to enhance internal systems to prevent future incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications: Data Security and KYC/AML

The incident highlights a significant problem in the crypto space related to data security, particularly concerning Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The collection of extensive personal data for KYC/AML purposes creates "honeypots" of information that are susceptible to hacks and data leaks, leading to a "privacy nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.

Some suggest that the ideal solution lies in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which do not collect this information in the first place, or in using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) to verify identity without revealing sensitive personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. However, there's concern that if only bad actors use on-chain privacy tools while good actors are forced to adhere to KYC/AML, it could lead to a "worst of all scenarios" where hackers are protected by privacy while legitimate users' data remains vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>.

The concept of "[[role_of_internet_in_modern_finance | Internet Capital Markets]]" has emerged as a prominent meme within the crypto community, defined by the process of building consumer applications, launching a token, and combining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This trend is exemplified by the **Believe app** and its associated token, **Launchcoin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Launchcoin and the Believe App

Launchcoin, the token connected to the Believe app, experienced a surge of 1,000% in 24 hours and an impressive 15,000% over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The phenomenon traces its roots back to early 2024 with projects like "Jelly Jelly," which saw its market cap reach $200 million in a single day before declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Originally known as Clout (clout.me), a social token app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, the Believe app allows users to create coins by tweeting at a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. A key feature is a 1% trading fee, with half of the fees directed to the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The premise is that creators can fund their applications through these [[token_launchpads_and_cryptocurrency_fundraising | memecoins]] if they generate sufficient attention and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Legitimate Apps and the "Pseudo Equity" Challenge

While many projects utilizing this model are not legitimate or are "rugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, some, like the AI app "Dupe," have gained significant traction. Dupe, which helps users find cheaper alternatives to desired items, became the largest market cap coin on the platform, excluding Launchcoin itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

A critical aspect of these tokens is the lack of explicit value: they offer no promise of equity or claim to anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Creators are exploring ways to provide utility, such as returning fees in the native coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This model incentivizes trading activity rather than long-term token holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Regulatory Hurdles and the Memecoin Reality

The primary obstacle to these "idea coins" or "founder coins" evolving into tokenized equity is regulatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Platforms explicitly state that they are not promising utility or that tokens will increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The ultimate goal is to enable the launch of tokenized equity on-chain in a compliant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. However, current regulations prohibit direct tokenized securities, leading to these "pseudo equity" forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

The trend has also seen a quick reversion to pure memecoins. "Gooncoin," a memecoin unrelated to any specific app, rapidly became the second-largest coin on the platform with a $50 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This highlights the ongoing challenge of distinguishing utility from speculation in the crypto market.

## Competition and Market Dynamics

The rise of Launchcoin fits into a broader competitive landscape of [[token_launchpads_and_cryptocurrency_fundraising | token launchpads]] like Pump Fun, Zora, and Boop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. While Pump Fun has been a dominant player, other platforms are gaining market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

The **Solana** ecosystem has also seen its share of *memecoin* activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Launchpads like Bonkf fun, built on Radium's Launch Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, allow projects to create branded launchpads. Radium's strategy of being a "launchpad for launchpads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a> appears to be effective, with its AMM doubling Pump Swap in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

A debate exists on whether *memecoins* are beneficial or parasitic to the underlying blockchain. Some argue that the fees generated by *memecoins* on *Solana* create sell pressure on the SOL token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This competition is driving market efficiency, with fees being passed back to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, aligning with the original open-source crypto thesis of fees compressing to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

The overall trend demonstrates a continued exploration of [[innovations_in_crypto_with_focus_on_internet_capital_markets | innovations in crypto with focus on internet capital markets]], aiming to democratize capital formation for long-tail projects by enabling permissionless issuance of financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. However, overcoming regulatory constraints and establishing true incentive alignment for teams and investors remains a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

To establish [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum (ETH)]] as a [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | digital gold]] with yield, a proactive and narrative-driven approach is advocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This strategy emphasizes the importance of meme culture in shaping the perception and value of a digital asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The "Meme Layer Narrative" for Store of Value

A **store of value** is described as being built on "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Gold, for instance, is characterized as "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   [[bitcoins_branding_as_digital_gold | Bitcoin]] is similarly defined as "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

It is suggested that the Ethereum community, being "smart and so ivory tower," may not fully respect the "[[memes_and_their_role_in_cultural_commentary | meme layer narrative]]" essential for creating a [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Strategies for Promoting ETH

A series of actions are proposed to reinforce ETH's status:
*   **Hold ETH** and encourage others to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Shame** entities like L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **Celebrate** and incentivize those who do hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Encourage staking, restaking, and auto-staking** ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Meme ETH as digital gold with yield** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Create and disseminate content** (write, tweet, podcast, shitpost) that supports this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Elect leaders** who align with these promotional efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Evangelize** the idea that "one ETH equals 1 E" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Role of Confidence and Community

While some may resist tactics like "shaming," the ultimate goal is to "win" and establish ETH's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The strategy doesn't require universal adoption within the Ethereum community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, but rather a "contingent of ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This doesn't necessitate the "Bitcoin toxicity" seen in other communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The focus should be on building faith in ETH as an asset and reorienting community discussions towards its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

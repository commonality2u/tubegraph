The United States bond market is currently experiencing significant challenges, notably a lack of buyers for its treasuries, which has led to increased yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This situation indicates growing investor jitters regarding the US tax bill deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Tepid Demand for US Treasuries

Recent Treasury auctions have shown tepid demand, meaning that the US government is struggling to find enough buyers for its bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. A specific instance highlighted was a $16 billion auction of 20-year bonds, where a lack of buyers caused bond prices to spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

This translates to rising interest rates, as investors demand more return for locking their capital into long-duration bonds, such as 30-year treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The yield on US 30-year government bonds has risen above 5%, a level not seen since 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Impact on US Deficit

Higher interest rates are problematic for the US deficit, as the government must print more money to cover its increasing debt servicing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The US federal debt has dramatically spiked, reaching $36 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Approximately two-thirds of this debt is public debt held by US investors, while the remaining third is held by foreign investors, with Japan and China being among the largest holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Reasons for Investor Apprehension

Several factors contribute to investors' lack of confidence in US bonds and their demand for higher rates:

*   **Unsustainable Debt:** The current level of US debt is seen as unsustainable, making a lack of investor confidence inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Trade Policies:** The [[us_stock_market_response_to_tariff_announcements | Trump tariffs]] are cited as a spark that has reduced international reliance on the United States as a hub for finance and reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Historically, dollars spent on foreign goods would return to the US to buy bonds, but this "last leg" is no longer consistently occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Shift in Global Capital:** Instead of buying US bonds, investors are increasingly purchasing assets like gold and [[bitcoin_and_stablecoin_market_trends | Bitcoin]], both of which have reached all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This suggests a "limbo period" where capital is being parked while the next epicenter of global finance is sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This plays into the long-standing "arc of nations" thesis discussed on Bankless, which favors credibly neutral, internet-based financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Policy Concerns:** The proposed Republican tax bill, called a "big beautiful bill" by Trump, could add an additional $3 to $5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade by cutting taxes and reducing IRS staff, hindering tax collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This has led to Moody's downgrading US sovereign debt again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Potential Solution: Stablecoin Bill

A landmark stablecoin bill, the Genius Act, recently passed a key preliminary vote in the US Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This bill aims to modernize the US payment system and position America at the forefront of financial innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

Key provisions of the Genius Act include:
*   Requiring stablecoins to be fully backed one-to-one by liquid assets, specifically US dollars or short-term US treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. This explicitly prohibits backing by crypto or equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   Mandating regular disclosure of reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   Prioritizing stablecoin holders in bankruptcy events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   Mandating Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   Defining eligible issuers as banks, credit unions, and non-bank entities registered with a federal regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   Prohibiting large tech companies (e.g., Amazon, Facebook, Google) from being issuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

Senator Hagerty believes this bill will stimulate demand for US treasuries, potentially making stablecoin issuers the number one holders of US treasuries globally by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This would ensure US dollar dominance and advance its position as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

The preliminary Senate vote passed 69-32, with 16 Democrats joining Republicans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. This strong bipartisan support makes it highly likely to pass the final vote in the Senate and subsequently in the House, leading to a landmark stablecoin bill in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Opposition to the Genius Act

Opposition mainly comes from politicians who favor centralized control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, rather than the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Notably, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer remained opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. The bank lobby also opposes the bill because stablecoins offer a way for users to hold balances without traditional bank accounts, circumventing KYC/AML requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. While banks capitulated on the overall bill, they successfully lobbied against stablecoins being able to offer yield to holders, keeping the high treasury yields for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

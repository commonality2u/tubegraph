A significant legal ruling against Apple's App Store policies has opened the door for greater [[ai_and_crypto_integration | crypto integration]] within the iOS ecosystem. This development challenges Apple's long-standing control over in-app commerce and is expected to have a profound impact on the utility of crypto assets and decentralized applications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

## App Store Monopoly Challenged

A US district court found that Apple "willfully violated a court injunction," forcing the company to change its App Store guidelines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> For years, Apple maintained a strong grip on commerce within its iOS ecosystem, notably through a 30% "Apple iOS tax" on in-app purchases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>

In 2021, a court had already ordered Apple to allow developers to direct users outside the App Store for purchases via links and buttons, bypassing the 30% fee. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> However, Apple implemented this with a 27% fee and "highly discouraging pop-ups" warning users about potential scams, which was deemed "compliance theater." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> The recent ruling explicitly states that applications can now have "clean speak buttons" to direct users off-site, state that off-site purchases are "30% cheaper," and Apple cannot display discouraging pop-ups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>

This legal battle originated from a lawsuit by Epic Games (Fortnite's creator) in August 2020, after Epic introduced a direct pay button in Fortnite to bypass Apple's tax, leading to Fortnite's delisting from the App Store. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>

## Impact on Crypto and Web3

The new changes are expected to significantly benefit the [[ai_and_crypto_integration | crypto industry]]:

*   **Direct Crypto Payments:** Apps in the App Store can now accept crypto payments directly, without routing through Apple, making it easier for users to spend assets like USDC, ETH, or Solana. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>
*   **NFT Marketplace Functionality:** Mobile apps for NFT marketplaces, which were previously restricted to "browse-only" functionality (e.g., OpenSea), can now allow buying and selling of NFTs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> This enables direct linking to crypto wallets for purchases, bypassing the 30% in-app fee. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>
*   **NFT-Gated Features:** Apps can now gate functionality or features via NFTs, a previously disallowed practice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a> This "opens up the playing field" for adding utility to NFTs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>

> "So much of the incumbency of the world prevents us from being having utility in our assets. It's because of Gary Gendler and because of Gary Gendler and Apple makes our assets useless. It's their fault, not ours." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>

## The Vision of Portable Property

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has expressed a vision for interoperable gaming assets, where items like Fortnite outfits could be transferable across different game ecosystems like Roblox. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a> He believes in a future "item economy where every game agrees to respect each other's item purchases." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>

While Sweeney argues that this doesn't strictly require NFTs, but rather "interoperability standards," the discussion highlights the need for a "credibly neutral property rights system" that isn't controlled by a single company like Epic or Microsoft. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a> This aligns with the concept of NFTs as portable property, suggesting that the integration of games and NFTs is "ahead of its time" rather than fundamentally wrong. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>

## Revisiting the Internet's "Original Sin"

Coinbase is working to address what some call the "original sin of the internet" â€“ the lack of native payment mechanisms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a> The HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code, drafted by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992, was intended for a payment web standard but was never fully completed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>

Coinbase is now "bringing it back" with "402," a new open-source payments protocol built on HTTP Rails. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a> This protocol enables microtransactions, allowing services like AI chatbots to pay external data sources using stablecoins (e.g., USDC on the Base network, which settles to Ethereum). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> This initiative could enable [[ai_and_crypto_convergence | AI and crypto convergence]], facilitating payments for content creators and microservices that AI bots consume, without traditional credit card fees or minimums. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>

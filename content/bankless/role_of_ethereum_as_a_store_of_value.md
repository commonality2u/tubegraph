From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ethereum]] community has been described as historically "too nice" in its approach, which contrasts with the Bitcoin community's method of clearly defining and defending its asset's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Bitcoin has successfully defined itself as a [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | store of value]] through a coordinated social understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This includes behaviors like shaming those who dilute the asset's focus with "too many tokens" or "coins," which serves as a coordination mechanism to prevent confusion about the asset's primary identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Defining Ethereum's Core Value

For [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]] to succeed, it is crucial to [[importance_of_defining_core_values_for_ethereum | define specific red lines]] or core values that the community will strongly uphold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. There needs to be an agreement on what these core values are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Without a unified front, a community that is "super duper nice" might appear fragmented or out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

A critical aspect of this definition is ensuring that [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ethereum]] is established and used as a [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. If [[economic_importance_of_ether_as_an_asset | Ethereum]] as a technology and settlement layer does not become recognized as a fundamental ledger, its long-term viability could be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

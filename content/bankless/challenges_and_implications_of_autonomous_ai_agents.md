The current focus in artificial intelligence (AI) development is on creating individual agents designed for specific tasks, such such as generating humor, providing financial insights, or executing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a significant shift in perspective points towards the larger picture: what happens when these [[development_and_goals_of_ai_agents_and_their_alignment | AI agents]] begin to interact with each other autonomously, 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This emerging reality presents both immense potential and considerable [[advantages_and_challenges_of_ai_agents | challenges and implications]].

## The Shift to Interacting Agent Swarms

While individual [[development_and_goals_of_ai_agents_and_their_alignment | AI agents]] can perform specific functions, the next level of development involves "agent swarms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. This concept envisions multiple agents, each with a specialized role, cohering and orchestrating together to achieve complex goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. For instance, a "Bankless" agent swarm could process various inputs (like market data, social media discussions) and produce formatted outputs (such as video and audio content), with each agent handling a specific part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. This autonomous interaction mimics businesses and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

## Financial Implications and Risks

The emergence of [[Decentralized AI agents and their applications | AI agents]] capable of generating financial "Alpha" and executing trades presents significant implications. An agent like AI xbt, which tweets out financial analyses, has already gained a large following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. While this can be seen as a positive development, there's a "scary" aspect to it: the potential for the agent to tweet out bizarre or incorrect financial predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>.

The ability of agents to autonomously influence financial markets raises concerns about the "tail wagging the dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. If an agent becomes known for making successful calls, people might blindly buy into the tokens it recommends, thereby making its predictions a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. There is an expectation of potential backlash when these agents make wrong calls, especially as autonomous trading goes live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.

## Governance and Guardrails

To prevent [[development_and_goals_of_ai_agents_and_their_alignment | AI agents]] from acting "berserk and chaotic," there's a strong emphasis on building in rules-based governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This includes:

*   **Agent Commerce and Businesses:** Allowing agents to form their own businesses and sub-DAOs, enabling them to earn and manage their own funds for operational costs like compute or inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Legal Structures:** Creating "legal entities" for agents to interact within a defined rules-based fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>.
*   **Preventing Centralized Control:** Avoiding reliance on centralized cloud servers that could shut down agents, instead opting for decentralized infrastructure ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This ensures agents operate without fear of censorship or external control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

The goal is to ensure agents can operate autonomously, fulfill their missions, and interact effectively, while also mitigating potential risks and ensuring a level of control and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

## The Future of AI Agent Interactions

The trend of [[development_and_adoption_of_ai_agent_platforms | AI agent platforms]] building similar infrastructure and converging on core functionalities is seen as a positive sign of a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. The shift from agents being merely "meme coins" to backing into fundamentals and utility is also a notable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

In the future, it's predicted that [[ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_in_2025 | AI agents]] will account for a significant portion of user transactions across all blockchains, becoming the inherent and native users due to their ability to work 24/7 with minimal error and reason without human emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. This era of "quantity" in AI fundamentals, where there's an explosion of requests and interactions, is expected to eventually evolve into a "quality era," where the focus shifts to effective and valuable interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

As Donald Trump prepares for his second term, dubbed the "first pro crypto president of the United States of America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, significant changes and potential [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | market trends]] are anticipated for the cryptocurrency sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The market has already seen fluctuations, with Bitcoin briefly tapping over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, buoyed by positive US economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Anticipated Policy Shifts and Market Reactions

### Regulatory Overhaul
The incoming administration under Trump is expected to initiate a "crypto overhaul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. This includes:
*   **Dismissal of Frivolous Cases** A key expectation is the dismissal of "frivolous cases" brought by the SEC against US-based crypto companies like Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, and Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   **Repeal of SAB 121** Trump is expected to repeal SAB 121, a rule that currently prevents banks in the US from custodying crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Executive Orders** Trump is expected to issue pro-crypto executive orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   **Reversal of SEC Stance on XRP** The SEC's attempt to repeal the classification that secondary market XRP sales are not securities, occurring just days before Trump's projected inauguration, is likely to be overturned by the new administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Non-Custodial Wallet Liability** An interpretive rule from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) to apply bank-like liability rules to non-custodial crypto wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, making wallet manufacturers liable for lost funds, is anticipated to be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### Potential for a [[Trumps Crypto Strategic Reserve | Strategic Crypto Reserve]]
There is speculation that Trump is "receptive to the idea of a reserve with coins founded in the US" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. This "American first strategic Reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a> might prioritize digital assets like Solana, USDC, and XRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. This idea is controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

### Fiscal Policy and Inflation
Trump's administration is expected to "unlead the fiscal Cannon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, potentially leading to a "risk on high inflation era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This contrasts with earlier predictions of Fed rate cuts in 2025, with some analysts now forecasting no cuts this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

### Market Movements Influenced by Trump's Stance
*   **XRP and "Boomer Coins"**: Coins like XRP, Iota, Stellar, Cardano, and Litecoin have seen significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, reminiscent of 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This surge is partly attributed to retail buyers re-entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> and the perception that "crypto is back on the menu in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Ripple's Confidence Boost**: Trump's potential promotion of US-domiciled crypto companies could "materially boost the confidence" of centralized organizations like Ripple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, which is well-suited to "cozy right up to Donald Trump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **XRP's Proximity to Ethereum**: XRP's fully diluted valuation was noted to be only 16% away from flipping Ethereum's market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The circulating supply of Ripple is almost double its fully diluted valuation, attributed to "shenanigans of Ripple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## New Appointments and Legislative Landscape

### Key Cabinet Positions
Several key cabinet positions are undergoing Senate confirmation hearings:
*   **Treasury Secretary**: Scott Bessent, a major donor, fundraiser, and economic adviser for Trump's 2024 campaign, is a likely nominee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. He is known for his "progressive stance on crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>, emphasizing digital assets as "integral to economic freedom and innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **SEC Chair**: Paul Atkins is considered a likely pick for SEC Chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda are expected to serve as acting chairs in the interim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **CFTC Chair**: While no specific name has been picked, Republican CFTC Commissioners Caroline Pham or Summer Messenger are expected to lead the agency in the interim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, with Brian Quintenz also on the short list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.
*   **Secretary of Commerce**: Howard Lutnick, chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald (which acquired a stake in Tether), is the nominee for Secretary of Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

This roster of potential nominees is seen as "pro crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

### Legislative Efforts
On the legislative side, the Republican takeover of the Senate and House is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Representative Tom Emmer has been appointed as the Vice Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The legislative agenda includes:
*   **Market Structure Frameworks**: Prioritizing frameworks like Fit21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **CBDC Restrictions**: Implementing restrictions on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Legislation**: Promoting global dollar-backed stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
*   **Commodity vs. Security Clarity**: Aiming to clarify the difference between a commodity and a security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.

The overarching goal is to ensure the future of digital assets is "Guided by Americans with American values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a> and to foster an environment where "digital asset innovation can Thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. This marks a "complete 180" from the policies of 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Context and Market Sentiment
The markets experienced a dip partly due to US economy data, where positive job reports led to speculation that the Fed would not cut interest rates as much as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, thus maintaining a restrictive [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_cryptocurrencies | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This means a less "easy money" environment, which is not necessarily bearish but indicates "downside protection" while trading off "upside risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The overall [[Impact of Macro Economic Policies on Crypto Markets | impact of macro economic policies on crypto markets]] and [[Impact of Market Valuations and Crypto Assets | market valuations]] on crypto assets remain a key area of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.# [[Impact of a Pro Crypto President on Markets | Impact of a Pro Crypto President on Markets]]

As the new year of 2025 begins, the Bankless Nation reflects on the [[Current state of the crypto market and consensus|current state of the crypto market]] and looks ahead to [[Crypto market trends and forecasts|potential market trends]] in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This article compiles some of the most notable predictions for 2025 from various thought leaders in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## Macro and Traditional Finance Outlook

### Bullish Stock Market Driven by AI
Vance Spencer of Framework predicts that the S&P 500 (SPX) will reach 7,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This significant increase from its current range of 5,800 is expected to be largely due to [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI delivering on its promises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI bull market]] in traditional finance is seen as running in parallel with the [[2025 crypto bull market predictions|crypto bull market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The prediction suggests a bullish year for stocks, primarily led by overperforming [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI stocks]] like the "Mag 7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Stablecoin Market Cap Growth
D from Blockworks forecasts that the stablecoin market cap will hit $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, a substantial increase from its current $210 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This prediction includes major fintech companies like Stripe or Robinhood launching their own stablecoins, and giants like Walmart or Amazon beginning to accept stablecoins for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. The growth is fueled by attractive DeFi yields and potential stablecoin legislation in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

### Government Spending and Risk-Taking
Coinbase predicts that the projected deficit spending of the next U.S. administration will translate into greater risk-taking, including [[2025 crypto bull market predictions|crypto buying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This implies increased liquidity in the economy, leading to more "risk-on" assets performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

### US Re-emergence as Crypto Hub
Mike Ippolito predicts the U.S. will re-emerge as the dominant global hub for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. This could see founders returning to the U.S., opening offices in cities like New York, and U.S. crypto conferences surpassing their Asian counterparts in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This trend is already showing initial signs with many companies moving back to or entering the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

### Bitcoin Adoption by Corporations and Nation States
Galaxy Digital predicts that five NASDAQ 100 companies and five nation states will announce adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## [[Potential longterm trends in crypto markets|Crypto Market Structure]] and [[Trends and highlights in the AI crypto investment market|AI Impact]]

### Crypto Market Verticalization
Deli Digital Crypt (Tommy) forecasts that crypto will split into two major verticals, sidelining other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>:
1.  **Web3 Natives**: Traders deeply embedded in the crypto market with a nuanced understanding, engaging in high-risk trading including memecoins, [[Trends and highlights in the AI crypto investment market|AI agents]], and pre-sales, reminiscent of the "Wild West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. These are the "dgen frontier crypto natives" following the "hot ball of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
2.  **Regular Investors**: Institutional and retail investors who adhere to more fundamental investment strategies, viewing crypto as an alternative to the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. These are "fundamentals types of investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

Sidelined areas include early-stage DeFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and DePIN protocols that fail to secure leading positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. It's suggested that individuals can participate in both strategies by allocating a smaller portion of their net worth to high-risk ventures and putting wins into long-term, passive investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

### [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI Agent]] Dominance
*   **Transaction Volume**: Tommy from Deli Digital Crypt also predicts that [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI agent-driven transactions]] will constitute 10% of all on-chain transactions by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Currently, this figure is likely less than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Talent Influx**: There will be a wave of San Francisco-based traditional [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI developers]] entering [[Trends and highlights in the AI crypto investment market|crypto AI]] due to tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Tokens offer them the ability to "break out of web2 AI labs" and raise capital and community overnight, leveraging the permissionless capital formation offered by crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This creates a "gravitational pull for AI talent" into the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Market Cap Growth**: Ezz, an [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI expert]], forecasts that an [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI agent platform]] will enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. This requires a market cap of over $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Currently, Virtuals is in the lead at $4.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Overall AI Agent Market Cap**: A Bankless consensus prediction, co-signed by the hosts and their [[Impact of AI Advancements on Crypto Markets|AI expert]], is that [[Trends and highlights in the AI crypto investment market|crypto AI agents]] will dominate the 2025 meta and hit $250 billion in market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. This is a significant jump from its current $17.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

### Social Media Integration with Crypto
Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures predicts that TikTok will turn all videos into meme coins that can be traded on decentralized exchanges globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. This prediction, reminiscent of 2021 NFT mania, is now seen as more plausible given the current regulatory environment (post-Gensler) and cheaper transaction fees across crypto networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Ethereum Price Prediction
A Bankless host's personal prediction for Ethereum (ETH) is a base case of $10,000, with a more optimistic range between $15,000 and $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. This bullish outlook is supported by increasing blob space consumption, rising fees and revenue, and the heating up of the [[Trends and highlights in the ai crypto investment market|AI meta]] on Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. The market has yet to fully experience a bull market with both Proof-of-Stake and EIP-1559, alongside blob fee burning, making ETH's price sensitivity to marginal inflows an unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

## Considerations for Predictions

It's acknowledged that many 2025 predictions tend to extrapolate recent trends, with some humorously suggesting that "the goal is not to predict what will happen six months ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. The market often gets blindsided by unexpected, bullish developments that were not on anyone's list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

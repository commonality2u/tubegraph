BlackRock, a global investment management corporation, plays a significant role in the evolving landscape of [[crypto_market_and_investment_strategies | crypto markets]]. Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock, oversees $6.6 trillion in index funds and iShares ETFs [00:43:57]. Cohen describes herself as a "career markets modernizer," driven by a passion for creating more resilient, transparent, and accessible markets [00:59:54].

## Modernizing Markets Through Technology
Cohen views technology as foundational to market modernization, citing historical examples such as ancient Mesopotamian clay tokens for trade and the first commercial microchip enabling complex indexing strategies [01:07:35]. Similarly, ETFs have served as a disruptive technology in traditional finance, aligning with BlackRock's goal of market improvement [01:07:00].

## Bitcoin and Ether Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)

### Success Metrics
A successful ETF, according to BlackRock, is one that accurately tracks its underlying index with precision and exhibits high market quality, including robust trading volumes, liquidity, and exchange access [00:17:18]. By these measures, both Bitcoin and Ether ETPs have had successful launches [00:17:10].

### Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto
The introduction of Bitcoin ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) approximately a year ago marked a "watershed moment" by creating a crucial bridge between the crypto world and traditional finance (Trafi) [01:10:21]. These products met the demand from Trafi investors who sought exposure to Bitcoin within a familiar investment wrapper [01:11:10]. Surprisingly, digital-native investors also found the ETP wrapper beneficial, with some making their first ETP purchase through Bitcoin ETPs, leading them to explore other ETPs for diversified portfolios [01:11:32].

### Performance and Perception
Despite some misperceptions, Ether ETFs were considered successful launches in the ETF world, even if not matching the record-breaking flows of Bitcoin ETFs [00:00:00]. The investment thesis for Bitcoin was more tangible in 2024, partly due to its simple narrative as "digital gold" with a 21-million-unit supply limit [01:49:47]. Bitcoin's relevance was heightened by geopolitical tensions, concerns over broad-based disruptions, and the dollar deficit [02:22:52].

For investors concerned about portfolio diversification, Bitcoin offers a potential ballast in a traditional 60/40 equity-bond portfolio, especially after 2022's challenging market conditions where both stocks and bonds declined together [02:31:09]. The Ether story, while important, is seen by some investors as less of a diversifier and more of an amplifier to existing exposures in mega-cap tech stocks [02:39:59].

## Investment Research and Allocation Recommendations
BlackRock does not provide investment advice but publishes investment research rooted in risk and portfolio risk assessment [02:54:55]. They have begun writing about Bitcoin in a portfolio context, focusing on its potential diversification aspects against traditional equities and bonds [02:55:11].

Their research on "portfolio interactions of Bitcoin" discusses potential sizing and allocation [02:16:15]. For investors considering Bitcoin, BlackRock suggests that a 1% to 2% allocation contributes a similar level of risk to the overall portfolio as a "Magnificent Seven" (Mag 7) stock [02:29:10]. Allocations above 2% are considered a strong view on Bitcoin specifically, rather than maintaining a diversified portfolio [02:32:00]. This research is intended for financial advisors, institutions, and individual investors [02:30:13].

## Role of Options in Market Maturation
The launch of options on Bitcoin ETPs in November 2024 was a significant development [03:17:00]. Options ecosystems are generally beneficial for markets, fostering balanced trading dynamics, providing new levels of transparency, and offering investors tailored exposures with limited downside [03:27:00]. BlackRock actively engages with the options ecosystem to enhance market quality, as ETPs with developed options ecosystems tend to have higher market quality [03:24:23].

Historically, many institutional investors first engaged with Exchange Traded Funds through options on those funds, appreciating the exposure with limited capital outlay and downside risk [03:40:03]. The development of this options ecosystem for ETPs is expected to aid the maturity and resilience of the market, potentially improving transparency in the underlying crypto derivative markets [03:39:37].

## BlackRock's Future [[investor_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | Investment Strategies in the Crypto Market]]
BlackRock's current near-term focus remains on Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, as these are the primary areas of client interest [03:49:10]. The firm acknowledges the crypto community's desire for ETFs for other digital assets, often driven by the perception that an ETF launch catalyzes price appreciation and legitimizes the asset [04:54:15]. However, BlackRock emphasizes that launching an ETF does not automatically create price appreciation; rather, it reflects existing investor demand and provides access [04:47:52]. The "investment thesis" for each native token of different blockchains—how cash flows are measured and risk is assessed—must be clearly defined for successful ETP launches [04:49:31].

Beyond ETPs, BlackRock's broader [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto_ai | digital assets strategy]] includes a strong focus on tokenization, particularly of Treasury funds, and an interest in the future path of stablecoins [05:39:10]. The firm prefers open architecture and interoperability in blockchain systems, leaning towards public over permissioned blockchains for scalability and broader participation [05:44:09].

## Regulatory Outlook
BlackRock deeply engages with the SEC, recognizing its profound impact on financial markets globally [05:50:00]. Samara Cohen is optimistic about a return to a more innovation-supportive regulatory environment in the US, while also emphasizing the importance of appropriate investor protections [05:51:00]. The firm hopes for clear regulatory basics, including definitions (e.g., what constitutes a security) and jurisdictional clarity (who is the regulator) [05:58:38].

BlackRock believes that future regulation should foster collaboration between the public and private sectors, integrating new frameworks like Fit21 and stablecoin bills with existing traditional finance regulations to avoid duplicative sets of rules [05:53:00]. The goal is to create an environment where both new and existing players can participate in the digital asset space effectively [05:59:56].

## Internal Collaboration
BlackRock's digital assets strategy is not confined to a single team but is a horizontal effort across the firm [01:02:49]. Robbie Mitnik, Head of Digital Assets, has integrated digital asset considerations into all business areas, including ETFs, index trading, cash securities, lending, and derivatives [01:01:11]. This approach allows for a broad consideration of potential use cases and opportunities, ensuring that digital asset solutions are adopted when they are truly the "right tool for the job" [01:03:02].

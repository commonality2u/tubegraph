MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is notable for its aggressive adoption of a [[the_concept_of_strategic_bitcoin_reserves | Bitcoin standard]] for its corporate treasury. The company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin and has plans to increase its holdings [00:08:38, 00:50:36].

## Current Holdings and Acceleration Plans
As of early 2025, MicroStrategy holds approximately 444,000 Bitcoin, placing it at the top among companies that have adopted the [[the_concept_of_strategic_bitcoin_reserves | Bitcoin standard]] [00:08:38, 00:08:40].

The company aims to accelerate its Bitcoin purchasing efforts, a plan referred to as the "2121 Bitcoin plan" [00:50:36, 00:50:49]. This initiative involves investing an additional $42 billion to expand its Bitcoin holdings, utilizing both debt instruments and equity [00:50:51, 00:50:59]. To achieve this, MicroStrategy has announced a special meeting for shareholders to vote on streamlining capital-raising efforts [00:51:01, 00:51:12]. This move is interpreted as an attempt by Michael Saylor to "front run himself" and consolidate his position [00:51:14, 00:51:18].

## Bitwise's Bitcoin Standard Corporate ETF
Bitwise has filed for a "Bitcoin Standard Corporate ETF," which aims to incentivize investments in companies that have adopted the [[the_concept_of_strategic_bitcoin_reserves | Bitcoin standard]] [00:07:00, 00:07:11]. To be included in this ETF, a company must hold 1,000 Bitcoin or more on its corporate [[Asset Allocation Strategies for Crypto Investors | balance sheets]] [00:07:24, 00:07:30]. MicroStrategy, with its substantial Bitcoin holdings, would be a prominent component of such an ETF [00:08:38].

The global financial markets experienced significant volatility due to the [[US foreign trade policies and tariffs under trump administration | Trump administration's new tariff policies]] and subsequent shifts in [[Trumps economic policies and their impact | trade policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The period was characterized by "total insanity in the traditional world," leading to market behavior resembling cryptocurrency volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Initial Tariffs and Market Reaction
On a Wednesday evening (last week relative to the recording), "liberation day tariffs" were announced, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and significantly higher reciprocal [[impact_of_reciprocal_tariffs_by_donald_trump | trade tariffs]] (30-80%) on 86 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These "staggering tariffs levels never before seen" caused the stock market to plummet, as the market believed [[Donald Trumps Historical Views on Tariffs | Trump was serious about these tariffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The S&P 500 declined 16% from peak to trough, marking one of the fastest stock market declines in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Global Response and Escalation of Trade Tensions
Following the tariff announcements, 70 countries reportedly rushed to the negotiation table with the United States by April 7th, signaling a readiness to renegotiate their [[implications_of_changing_global_trade_relationships | trade arrangements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. China, however, was an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. After Trump imposed a 34% reciprocal tariff on China, China retaliated with its own 30% tariff on all U.S. imports, set to go live in the coming days, thus "kicking off the [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | trade war]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

President Trump subsequently threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods unless China withdrew its retaliatory measures by April 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. When China did not back down and proceeded with its planned 34% tariff increase (stacking on top of previous tariffs for a total of 84% net new tariffs on the U.S.), Trump immediately increased tariffs on China to 125% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Simultaneously, he announced a 90-day pause on all tariff hikes for the rest of the world, reverting to the general 10% import tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This policy was posted on Truth Social, clarifying China's total tariff rate at 145% (stacked on a previous 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The market responded with "huge relief," immediately rallying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This strategy, reportedly written by Secretary Besson, was seen as an "art of the deal" maneuver, isolating China in an escalating [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | trade war]] while other nations negotiated more favorable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Critique of Trump's Tariff Policy

### Misconception of "Reciprocal Tariffs"
The speaker criticizes Trump's approach, arguing that his definition of "reciprocal tariffs" was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Trump's tariffs were based on *trade deficits* (imbalance of trade), not actual tariff rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. For example, Vietnam, a poor country that cannot afford many U.S. high-value goods, was hit with a 70% plus tariff, despite not having such high tariffs on the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Even countries with a trade surplus with the U.S., like Australia, were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Trump also made unsubstantiated claims, such as accusing Japan of currency manipulation, demonstrating a lack of understanding of global monetary policy and [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | tariff disputes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Misunderstanding Trade Deficits
>Trump fundamentally misunderstands trade deficits, believing that buying more from another country than selling to them means the U.S. is "getting ripped off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This view contrasts with the economic understanding that a trade deficit often corresponds to a capital surplus, indicating foreign investment into the U.S. economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Lack of Predictability and Impact on Investment
Trump's inconsistent communication and frequent policy reversals led to severe market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Businesses, seeking predictability, paused investment in the U.S. because they "could not trust the word of the US government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The shift from "the biggest tax hike in history" (massive tariffs) to a complete unwind within a week demonstrated this unreliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This short-term policy approach makes long-term investments like building factories in the U.S. unfeasible, as future administrations could easily reverse the tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Political and Financial Pushback
A "revolt within the financial class" and among Republicans in Congress emerged, with concerns that the tariffs were "nonsensical policy" and would negatively impact Republicans in the midterms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Figures like Bill Ackman, a Trump supporter, publicly criticized the policy and suggested a 90-day pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This public pressure, along with intervention from Secretary Besson, ultimately led to Trump's public backpedaling on tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Despite claims of not paying attention to markets, reporting indicated Trump was indeed influenced by prominent financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Economic Consequences

### Market Performance and Trust
The initial relief rally was short-lived, with the S&P 500 losing many of its gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Overall, the stock market remained down significantly from "liberation day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This period saw a "miserable triple whammy": stocks down, 10-year bond yields up (indicating less demand for treasuries), and the dollar down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This suggests a weakening of the United States as the "capital center of the world" and a decline in trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

>[!INFO] Cost of Instability
>The ongoing market decline and volatility are attributed to the "cost of instability" and the U.S. being perceived as an "unreliable partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Predictability and stability are crucial for a financial center, and erratic [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact | fiscal policy]] undermines this strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### Inflationary Pressures
Tariffs are inherently inflationary because they tax trade, increasing the cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The 10% universal tariff means there's no substitutability for affected goods, leading to higher prices for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. The 145% tariffs on China are seen as "very close to a trade embargo," making it uneconomical to import from one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This is expected to show up in future inflation numbers, with consumer inflation expectations already rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

### Geopolitical Implications
The unpredictable [[US foreign trade policies and tariffs under trump administration | U.S. trade policy]] risks alienating allies, potentially pushing them towards China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. An example cited is the potential for increased coordination between China, Japan, and Korea, historically adversarial nations, as China positions itself as a "reliable free trade partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Implications

### Continued Volatility and Uncertain Goals
The next 90 days are expected to remain "really volatile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. The lack of clarity on [[trumps_economic_policies and their impact | Trump's fundamental goals]] (whether for zero tariffs and free trade or revenue and punishment) creates ongoing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Companies remain hesitant to invest in U.S. manufacturing due to the lack of long-term assurances regarding tariff policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### Recession Probability and Midterms
There is a significant probability of a recession, with markets pricing in a 50% chance even after the tariffs were walked back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This self-imposed economic instability could lead to Republicans being "trounced in the midterms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. As such, it's anticipated that Trump will be forced to implement stimulative policies going into Q4 and Q1 of the next year to avoid losing the midterms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Impact on Crypto Markets
While broadly affected by macro volatility, the crypto market's demand is largely international, making it less dependent on the U.S. consumer balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. Crypto is strongly tied to global liquidity, suggesting that any emergency liquidity injections or Federal Reserve rate cuts in response to a potential financial crisis could lead to a significant rebound in crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. The perceived shift in the SEC's stance towards crypto, under new leadership, is also seen as a positive fundamental for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

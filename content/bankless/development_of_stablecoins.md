The development of valuable [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] is considered to be only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, indicating significant room for [[emerging_stablecoin_technology_and_blockchain_design | emerging stablecoin technology and blockchain design]] and growth.

## Market Opportunity and Utility

The global cross-border payments market is substantial, accounting for $200 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Currently, cross-border transactions using [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] amount to approximately $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This stark difference highlights the immense potential for [[growth_and_utility_of_stablecoin_market | growth and utility of stablecoin market]] in this sector.

For cross-border use cases, [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] are viewed as "functionally and unequivocally better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> compared to traditional methods. A significant portion of this market, particularly the Small and Medium Business (SMB) segment, which constitutes about 40% of the $200 trillion total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, would be better served by [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] and "stablecoin rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Challenges and Infrastructure Requirements

Despite their potential, widespread adoption of [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] for payments requires solving key [[infrastructure challenges in stablecoins | infrastructure problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These challenges include:
*   Compliance concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Ensuring sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Reducing transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Developing "last mile" solutions for widespread accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Addressing these issues is crucial for building the necessary [[infrastructure required for stablecoin payments | infrastructure required for stablecoin payments]].

## Impact on Traditional Financial Services

The emergence of [[stablecoins and their significance in fintech | stablecoins]] poses a significant [[impact of stablecoins on traditional banks | impact on traditional banks]] and payment services. For example, a business like Wise, which targets a market worth $50 trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, operates with capital inefficiency and requires extensive interconnectivity with the banking system and significant operational connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. If transactions were conducted on [[stablecoin and their significance in fintech | stablecoin]] rails, such operational and capital requirements would be significantly reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This could lead to traditional services like Wise either adopting [[stablecoin and their significance in fintech | stablecoin]] technology themselves or facing displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] has experienced a period of introspection and reorientation, with signals indicating a need for change becoming increasingly prominent as other ecosystems gained traction and the ETH price lagged the market for nearly three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. By 2025, the focus shifted from acknowledging a problem to understanding its precise nature and determining appropriate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite Ethereum's slow adaptation, a strong consensus has emerged regarding the urgency of short to medium-term actions required to restore growth and move past complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum culture]], prioritizing shorter time frames, which were previously not a core part of its approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Defining the Problem

The challenges faced by Ethereum have been difficult to concisely define, often leading to nuanced discussions on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Various perspectives attributed the issues to:
*   **Marketing problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   **Product problem** or lack of a clear northstar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>
*   **Leadership problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>

Dankrad Feist highlighted that while the lagging ETH price was a primary concern, the underlying issue was a decline in activity on Ethereum's mainnet (L1), leading to less app building and fewer users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Ethereum was no longer the obvious default platform for crypto development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

The root cause of these issues, according to Dankrad, was the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation (EF)]] and Ethereum itself operating as an "ivory tower," focusing on high-brow research without sufficiently listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This resulted in not treating Ethereum as a product designed to serve its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Onskar Dietrich further elaborated, stating that the downstream consequences of decentralization were never taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Ethereum functioned in a sphere where "no one is in charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, lacking clear responsibility for the overall product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The EF viewed its [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | role]] primarily as a public goods funding organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This approach became unsustainable against competitors more willing to embrace leadership to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The current period necessitates restructuring to address the unique challenges posed by decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The problem was largely self-inflicted, not a struggle to achieve growth, but rather a rejection of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. While the rollup-centric roadmap was correct for the long term, there was a failure to consider the immediate needs of the L1 as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Shifts in the Ethereum Foundation's Approach

The [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum Foundation]] is undergoing a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. Previously, the EF functioned primarily as a public goods funding organization, distributing money to independent projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. The role of the Executive Director was more representative and focused on external contacts and facilitating smooth operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

A crucial shift is the EF's expanded responsibility:
*   **Product-focused mindset:** The EF is now embracing a product mindset, aiming to unify individual projects and teams into one cohesive, shared product view and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.
*   **Leadership changes:** The executive director role has evolved to a CEO-style function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This includes the appointment of new co-CEOs, Tomas and Shiao, who are focused on building new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.
*   **Communication improvements:** There has been a massive upgrade in internal and external communication. Tomas, for example, is open to calls with anyone, signaling a clear change from the previous "ivory tower" stance to one of active listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>.

While the EF is not in charge of Ethereum, which remains a decentralized ecosystem, it is taking on a greater responsibility to holistically guide Ethereum towards a better product experience and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This means a change in the makeup of people involved in strategic conversations, with more diverse voices being included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

### Historical Context and [[Ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Strategic Pivot]]

Historically, Ethereum operated in a "sandbox environment" focused on developing the infrastructure stack without immediate real-world users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. The mindset was to ensure the technology would be ready when it mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. However, as the real world began adopting blockchains, Ethereum found itself "on the back foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. The current realization is the need to be ready in months, not years, especially with institutions looking to deploy on blockchains now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

The shift in focus includes:
*   **Scaling the L1:** A major focus is now on scaling the L1, with a clear commitment to supporting activity on the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>. This is partly enabled by the readiness of ZK-VMs, which were not available even a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>.
    *   **Capacity Increase Goals:** The goal is to scale the L1 by approximately 3x per year, aiming for 100 million gas by the end of the current year, and then 10x from current levels within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. This means a potential increase to 300 million gas per block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>. This scaling can occur in three stages:
        1.  **Pushing existing system:** Utilizing available headroom without tech changes (e.g., from 30 to 36 million gas, aiming for 100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>.
        2.  **Individual features:** Implementing features like delayed execution and access list parallelization (e.g., Glamsterdam hard fork) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:52">[02:04:52]</a>.
        3.  **ZK-based scaling:** The long-term step (2-3 years out) where ZK-proofs enable aggressive scaling while maintaining lightweight verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>.
    *   There is now almost full acceptance for scaling the L1 by at least 10x, with ongoing efforts to gain support for further increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.
*   **L2 Integration:** The rollup-centric roadmap remains foundational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>. The benefits of L2s include providing generic spillover space from the L1, which cannot handle all demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:18">[01:41:18]</a>. The focus is on seamless interoperability and standards for assets flowing between L1 and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. The long-term vision is for L2s to become so transparent that users don't distinguish between L1 and L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:03">[01:42:03]</a>. Additionally, there is room for special-purpose L2s for specific applications like gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>.
    *   A critical aspect is ensuring that L2s have strong reasons to remain connected to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. If the L1 lacks activity, L2s might choose other data availability layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:25">[01:44:25]</a>.
    *   The aim is to offer a path to closer interoperability with the L1 that is attractive to L2s, creating a mutually beneficial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.
    *   The idea of the L1 EVM itself becoming a canonical rollup is being considered, which would entail a shared tech stack between the L1 and native L2s, leading to better UX and composability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:49">[01:58:49]</a>.
*   **Reducing Block Times/Improving Latency:** While not as advanced in planning as L1 scaling, reducing block times is a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:41">[02:09:41]</a>. This includes:
    1.  **Optimistic pre-confirmations:** Providing quick, cryptoeconomic promises for transaction inclusion and outcome, similar to sequencer guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:17">[02:10:17]</a>. This could enable 100-millisecond roundtrip pre-confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:27">[02:20:27]</a>.
    2.  **Faster finality:** Important for L2 interaction and exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:54">[02:10:54]</a>.
    3.  **Time to censorship resistance:** Reducing the monopoly power of block proposers to ensure quicker inclusion of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:36">[02:11:36]</a>.
    *   Reducing slot times to potentially 6 seconds is considered feasible in the medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>. Further reductions to potentially 1 second are long-term goals, requiring significant changes to staking and signature requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>.

## Current State of Change

The [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | EF's new leadership]] is bringing significant energy and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. There is a palpable excitement among EF staff about this new opportunity, as they recognize the need for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>. The shift in mindset, from being an academic "ivory tower" to embracing a product-driven approach, is a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

While the mindset has turned, the actual implementation requires major changes in operational modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. [[The_relationship_between_Etherealize_and_the_Ethereum_Foundation | Etherealize]] is expected to contribute to this new energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. The changes are expected to become apparent on a 3-month timeline, not a 3-year one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>.

The [[Ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum ship]] is perceived to be turning, and in a direction that aligns with desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>. This period of challenge is seen as fostering a stronger protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>. Despite the need for meaningful change, Ethereum remains in a very strong position due to its core strengths and differentiating factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.

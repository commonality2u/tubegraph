Ethereum is described as a constantly evolving organism that adapts through a slow, iterative process of debate, deliberation, and rough consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The "all core devs calls" serve as the central forum where priorities are determined and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are approved or rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Tim Beiko, a coordinator of these calls, manages conversations and priorities from various components that constitute Ethereum, ensuring progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Prioritizing Security

The primary distinguishing feature of Ethereum, setting it apart from other blockchains, is its "extremely robust approach to security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This dedication manifests in the network's history of never having gone down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. A significant amount of work goes into ensuring this, with discussions in core dev calls often revolving around questions like: "Is this thing safe? How is it going to break? And if it broke, why and how can we fix it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

Security is the fundamental factor that dictates all other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Any proposed feature or upgrade must first pass through a "security filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. If Ethereum aims to be a "robust, durable platform which secures billions and potentially trillions of assets," it must prioritize safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Unlike traditional financial systems where centralized third parties (like banks) can intervene legally to correct errors or fraud, Ethereum lacks such off-chain mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Once a smart contract is deployed or assets are on the chain, there is no other way to change the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Historical events like Bitcoin's inflation bug and Ethereum's DAO hard fork illustrate that such interventions are highly contentious and the bar for them to occur is continuously rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Therefore, the network must be secure with the assumption that no intervention will be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Impact on Upgrade Processes

The focus on security is a primary reason why [[Challenges in Ethereums upgrade processes | Ethereum upgrades slowly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Upgrades typically occur every six to twelve months, rather than weeks, due to a thorough testing cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Many proposed EIPs are not deployed because they are found to have security vulnerabilities, often taking years to iterate on a design to ensure its safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For example, EIP-772, related to account abstraction, has been in development since 2017-2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

While some delays are due to process and operations, which the core developers aim to optimize, others are due to the inherent difficulty of research and development (R&D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. If a critical upgrade like "the Merge" required an additional six months due to a fundamental difficulty, it was considered a necessary cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. This contrasts with arbitrary deadlines, where shipping less useful features just to meet a date is avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

A common misconception is claiming a delay before a definite date has been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. The challenge for core developers is communicating the current level of uncertainty regarding timelines without over-promising or appearing irrelevant by stating "it'll ship when it's ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

## Scaling and Security

[[Challenges and Solutions in Ethereum Scaling | Scaling]] has been a prominent theme for the past year, encompassing both the execution and consensus layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The focus is on scaling without compromising the network's ability to continue operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. While other chains might fork Ethereum's code and drastically increase parameters like gas limits or lower slot times to achieve scale, they often compromise syncability and require manual operations or chain restarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

There is a "renewed focus" or "renewed appetite" for aggressive scaling within the core dev community, acknowledging that scaling should be a primary priority among a smaller subset of concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This means identifying bottlenecks on the execution layer and addressing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

### Upcoming Upgrades Addressing Scaling and Security

*   **Pectra Hard Fork (Expected May):**
    *   **Increasing Validator Maximum Balance (Max EB):** This allows large operators (like [[Ethereums Consensus Layer and Validator Changes | Lido]]) to consolidate their validators into chunks of up to 2048 ETH, reducing network bandwidth usage by sending fewer, but heavier, messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Smaller validators can also auto-compound their rewards more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. While the exact bandwidth savings are yet to be seen, this optimization creates more room for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
    *   **Increased Blob Count:** Pectra will increase the average number of blobs per block from three to six (up to nine in worst-case scenarios), effectively doubling blob data availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This is directly enabled by bandwidth savings and mitigations for worst-case execution layer block sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Blobs provide a 100x cost reduction for Layer 2s by storing data temporarily rather than permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
    *   **EIP-772 (Account Abstraction):** This EIP introduces the first in-protocol version of account abstraction, allowing users to delegate smart contract functionality to their existing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. This acts like a "plugin" for an EOA, offering features like multi-signature (similar to a Gnosis Safe) or auto-approvals, with the flexibility to change or revoke delegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. A key security consideration is that delegation is chain-specific, preventing a bad delegation on one chain from affecting assets on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. While not a "silver bullet," it addresses most user use cases and avoids delaying valuable features by striving for a perfect solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
*   **Fusaka Hard Fork (Targeting 2025):**
    *   **[[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | PeerDAS (P-DAS)]]:** This is a qualitative leap in data availability, moving from every node storing all blob data for a few weeks to every node storing only a subset of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Cryptography is used to probabilistically guarantee that other nodes hold the full data, potentially leading to a 10x increase in data availability for the same bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The target is to reach 48 blobs on average, a significant increase from Pectra's six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
    *   **Ethereum Object Format (EOF):** EOF aims to upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from a "1950s computer" to a "1990s computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This primarily improves the developer experience by separating code and data within EVM contracts, making tooling and compilers easier to write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. It also allows for banning certain problematic opcodes in new contracts, improving security and long-term roadmap alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.
    The scope for Fusaka is kept relatively small to ensure PeerDAS and EOF ship as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam Hard Fork:**
    *   This is currently a placeholder name with no finalized scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. The core devs are aiming to improve the parallelization of fork planning and implementation, so that as soon as one fork is complete, prototypes for the next are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

## Layer 1 Scaling and Interoperability

Scaling the [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | execution layer]] (Layer 1) involves more complex, multivariate inputs compared to the consensus layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. While the gas limit is a coarse lever, a better understanding of bottlenecks like state growth and history growth is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. Efforts include re-pricing opcodes to make certain operations cheaper and potentially delaying block verification to account for MEV-driven block building dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

Regarding [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | interoperability and fragmentation of Layer 2s]], while core protocol-level solutions could exist (e.g., "native rollups" with common pre-compiles), they are complex and years away from implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. In the short term, focus remains on application-level and wallet-level standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

## Summer of Protocols

The "Summer of Protocols" initiative, back for 2025, aims to better understand and formalize the concept of protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. Recognizing a lack of frameworks for working with protocols, similar to those for software engineering or startups, the program funds researchers to study protocols across various domains (e.g., cryptography, wildfire management, plurality voting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. The goal for 2025 is to organize this knowledge and make it understandable through educational materials like classes, online courses, and books, providing a unified explanation of how protocols work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. This initiative helps in framing Ethereum's challenges through the lens of protocol problems, facilitating engagement with experts outside of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.

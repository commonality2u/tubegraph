Ethereum is set to undergo a full year of [[Ethereum Roadmap and Future Upgrades | upgrades]] in 2025, with several key developments on the [[Ethereum roadmap | roadmap]] that are expected to shape the network's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. The EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) mempool, which determines which EIPs are added to hard forks, is beginning to settle as the network approaches the [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra upgrade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra Upgrade]]
The [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra upgrade]], anticipated to be implemented in 2025, includes several significant EIPs:

*   **Max Effective Balance (Max EB)** This EIP allows Ethereum validators to have an effective balance of 32 ETH or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. This means that newly accrued Ether rewards are automatically staked, rather than needing to be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. It also enables the consolidation of multiple validators into a single validator, which reduces messaging overhead and positively impacts the [[Ethereum development priorities | scalability]] of the Ethereum Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. This improvement benefits stakers by enhancing their quality of life and helps reduce network bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Account Abstraction for Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) Wallets** This feature will allow EOA wallets, which are the most common type of user wallet, to function like account-abstracted wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   **Blob Throughput Increase** The average number of blobs will double from three to six in the [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra upgrade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. This is accompanied by an increase in call data costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

### Pias and Fusaka
Notably, a massive upgrade to blob space called Pias (Data Availability Sampling) is not included in the [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra upgrade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Pias is considered the "next zero-to-one moment" for blob space, representing a significant order-of-magnitude increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Instead, Pias is slated for Fusaka, the hard fork following [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. This means that Pias is unlikely to be implemented in 2025, with a more probable timeline of late 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. Therefore, the only additional blob space increase in 2025 will be the doubling from three to six blobs in [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

The rise of AI agents, predicted to account for 10% of on-chain transaction volumes, is expected to lead to a massive consumption of blob space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. This demand could quickly absorb the increased blob capacity provided by the [[Ethereums Pectra Upgrade | Pectra upgrade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.

The speaker strongly believes that hardware revolutions consistently precede software revolutions, considering it almost a definitional point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Hardware as the Foundation for Software Innovation

Significant software advancements and the creation of new economies are directly reliant on prior developments in hardware.

### The App Store and Mobile Technology
The App Store, which facilitated the emergence of major companies like Uber, necessitated the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself was dependent on companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, as well as over 20 years of network and communications technology development, primarily at the [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Deep Learning and GPUs
The advent of deep learning required the development of the GPU, representing two decades of progress in [[advancements_and_challenges_in_ai_hardware_and_software_integration | hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Cloud Computing and Commodity Hardware
Cloud computing relies on the availability of very cheap [[commoditization_of_hardware_technologies | commodity hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core concept of cloud computing involves placing numerous cheap commodity hardware units in a single location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Distributed systems then apply algorithms on top of this commodity hardware to manage failures and breakages in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach offers a significant cost advantage compared to hosting one's own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The development of cloud computing was made possible by over 20 years of progress in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

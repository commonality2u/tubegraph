The current economic climate is characterized by significant market turbulence, particularly in crypto markets, influenced by shifting economic policies and geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This article explores the potential future of the US economy under [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | Donald Trump's economic policies]], drawing insights from macro researcher and crypto investor Jim Bianco.

## Trump's Economic Philosophy: A "Different Approach"

Donald Trump's economic approach is not aimed at destroying the economy, but rather represents a "different approach" to long-standing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This strategy is primarily driven by an "America First" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

> [!info] Addressing the National Debt
> The federal debt situation, reaching $36 trillion, is deemed unsustainable, necessitating a change from traditional budgeting methods that have failed for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Trump's administration seeks to address this by moving away from the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Historically, few politicians have been incentivized to reduce national debt due to short-term election cycles favoring spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Trump's second term, with no re-election incentive, might allow him to implement "hard things" like belt-tightening, which could cause short-term market fear but potentially long-term [[Investment and economic stability in the US | stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Rebalancing the US Economy

A significant driver of the recent strong economy has been government spending and deficits, which, while boosting GDP numbers, are considered inefficient and unnecessary by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Trump's strategy includes reducing government's role in producing GDP, cutting regulation, and lowering taxes to unleash "Animal Spirits" in the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This aims to foster more productive and higher-quality GDP growth driven by true economic activity and innovation, rather than government-injected funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Scott Bessent, a key figure in the administration, articulated a focus on "Main Street" – small businesses and consumers – over Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

> "Over the medium term... it's a focus on Main Street. Wall Street's doing great, it's done great. Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have to focus on small businesses and consumers. We are going to rebalance the economy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>

This rebalancing implies a willingness to accept "short-term pain" for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, redirecting focus from the S&P 500 to the 10-year yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The goal is to lower the 10-year yield, primarily to reduce mortgage rates for average citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, targeting the 10-year yield is ambiguous, as a decline can signify either positive (less inflation) or negative (economic slowdown/recession) developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## [[Trumps tariff strategy and its impacts]] and Trade Wars

Trump's "America First" policy includes addressing perceived asymmetrical tariffs, where other countries tariff US exports more than the US tariffs imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

[[US Tariff Policies and Market Impact | Tariffs]], in Trump's view, serve two purposes:
1.  **Revenue source**: He has suggested creating an external revenue service to collect tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
2.  **Leverage**: To compel other countries to level the playing field, as seen with Mexico agreeing to border troops in response to tariff threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

The trade system has evolved to be unfair, with higher tariffs on American products entering foreign markets compared to foreign products entering the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This imbalance has gradually accrued over time because the US has historically prioritized free trade without pushing back effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. The current [[Impact of tariffs on global trade and economy | trade war]] is leading to growing tensions, exemplified by Ontario's proposed 25% export tax on electricity to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Global Security and Defense Spending
Trump also argues that the US bears an disproportionate burden for global defense, citing trillions spent on keeping shipping lanes open and fighting terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. Countries like Canada, Mexico, and European nations have enjoyed a "free ride" under the US security umbrella, with military budgets significantly lower as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. This is a key reason for his demands on Mexico to deploy troops at the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

The goal is to redistribute the cost of global security, potentially reducing the US defense budget (currently $900 billion annually) and thus reducing the need to issue bonds, which could help lower the 10-year yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

## The Crypto Strategic Reserve

Donald Trump's announcement of a crypto strategic reserve, made via Truth Social, included assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, XRP, and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This announcement initially caused a significant surge in crypto prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, but prices soon retraced to below pre-announcement levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> [!warning] Market Reaction to Crypto Strategic Reserve
> The price retracement was primarily due to Trump's strong emphasis on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, which caused broader "risky markets" (stocks, corporate bonds, crypto) to react negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This suggests that the broader macro-economic policies and focus on the economy significantly overshadow the [[Impact of a pro crypto president on markets | bullishness]] of the crypto strategic reserve announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

A theory circulating is that the "crypto strategic reserve" might simply be a transfer of crypto assets already seized by the Justice Department through criminal investigations, rather than new purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This would avoid the perceived negative optics of borrowing to buy crypto while mortgage rates are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### Long-Term Implications for Crypto
In the long term, a government-held crypto reserve is viewed critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. While crypto's production level is decentralized and immutable, centralizing its ownership with the federal government could diminish these properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This could grant the government undue influence over the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

The inclusion of various altcoins like Cardano, Ripple, and Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum has raised concerns within the crypto community about potential bias, corruption, and "grift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This might incentivize crypto companies to focus on lobbying and influence rather than innovation and product development, which is antithetical to crypto's foundational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

Furthermore, the term "reserve" usually implies backing a currency and being held by a central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. If this "reserve" is merely an asset within a sovereign wealth fund, it suggests the government views crypto as a speculative investment to pay off national debt, rather than a fundamental shift in the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This changes crypto's mission from being a disruptive, alternative financial system to one influenced and potentially stifled by government ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Recession Probability

The ongoing debate revolves around whether [[US economic policies and trade tariffs | Trump's policies]] will lead to an economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. PolyMarket currently assigns a 40% chance of a US recession in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

Recessions are often caused by "an event that scares the hell out of everybody" leading to behavioral changes, rather than gradual economic data shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. Examples include the COVID-19 shutdown, the 2008 financial crisis, and 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. While the economy might experience slower growth (below the 2-2.5% potential), it is not definitively heading for a full recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.

Recent fluctuations in GDP trackers (like the Atlanta Fed's) can be misleading. A decline in Q1 GDP predictions, for instance, was partly due to a surge in imports in December and January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This import surge was likely a "front-loading" by businesses anticipating Trump's tariffs, meaning future months may see a rebound in the GDP calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.

## Investment and Market Dynamics

The era of easy money, where simply buying Bitcoin or S&P 500 ETFs guaranteed 20-30% annual gains, is likely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. The market is entering a period of turbulence and "indigestion," characterized by sideways churn and a reduction of speculative froth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. This includes excessive speculative trading in both crypto (meme coins, NFTs) and traditional markets (zero DTE options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.

While the administration aims to lower interest rates, it is unlikely to fully control the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. [[Investment and economic stability in the US | Interest rates]] are expected to remain "sticky high," potentially in the 4-5% range (or even 6% if the economy overheats), due to persistent inflation around 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. This signifies a shift away from the "QE zero interest rate money printing period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.

Despite the current market uncertainties, there is a degree of optimism about the medium to long-term outlook. The shift away from government-bolstered growth towards higher-quality, genuine economic activity from small businesses (which employ a large percentage of the US workforce) is seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. If these policies are executed properly, they could reduce the deficit, improve the trade balance, and naturally lead to lower bond issuance and potentially lower interest rates over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

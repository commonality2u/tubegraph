The landscape of AI development is seeing a significant shift from centralized "Trad AI" towards an [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | open source development]] paradigm. This movement is gaining momentum, challenging the dominance of large, closed-source AI labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Evolution of Open Source AI
Historically, leading AI models like Grok 3 from xAI are not immediately open source upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Instead, older versions of models, such as Grok 2, are open-sourced once newer iterations are stabilized and released into production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This creates a tiered system where cutting-edge models remain proprietary, while older ones become accessible for monetization and further development by the [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | open source world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

However, the gap between proprietary and [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | open source AI development]] is rapidly shrinking. What once took nine, then six, then three months for [[opensource_ai_innovations | open source innovations]] to catch up, is now happening in a matter of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This accelerated iteration means that even open-source models are quickly becoming competitive with, and in some cases outperforming, models from major labs like [[openais_model_and_agent_developments | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Scrappy teams are demonstrating an ability to make significant leaps forward, challenging the entrenched incumbents in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is partly due to new techniques that allow for the creation of high-quality models using less compute and data, as pioneered by DeepSeek AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This development significantly benefits [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | Open Source development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Key Players and Models in Open Source AI
### News Research
News Research, a crypto-native team of engineers, originated as a pure [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | open source AI research]] team dedicated to building for the [[open_source_movement_in_ai_and_crypto | open source good]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. They have contributed to advancements in distributed and decentralized training of AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

They have released their own series of [[open_source_ai_models | Open Source AI models]] called "Heres," with the latest being Heres 3 Preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This model unifies reasoning and intuitive language capabilities and incorporates groundbreaking techniques similar to DeepSeek, specifically reinforcement learning with reasoning data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Heres 3 offers open access and can be hosted on decentralized compute networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

A notable characteristic of models from the [[open_source_movement_in_ai_and_crypto | open source AI community]], including News Research, is their tendency to be less censored and more candid compared to heavily curated models like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Microsoft's Contributions
Microsoft has also released a 100% [[importance_of_open_source_in_ai_development | open source tool]] that enables AI models to function as agents capable of using a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This means an agent hosted on a local device can interact with the computer's interface, perform tasks, monitor activities, and even conduct transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. While this raises privacy and security concerns regarding giving an AI entity control over personal computing, it reflects a broader trend among major companies like [[openais_model_and_agent_developments | OpenAI]] and Anthropic, and various crypto companies, towards integrating "computer use" into agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Impact on Crypto AI and Agents
The increasing performance and capacity of [[open_source_ai_models | AI models]] make it significantly easier for AI agents and startups in the crypto space to build innovative applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. As the "hot air" of speculation leaves the crypto industry, the fundamental capabilities available to crypto AI developers are rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## AI Agent Interaction and Future Directions
The rapid progress in [[developments_in_ai_frameworks_and_agent_technologies | AI frameworks and agent technologies]] is leading to scenarios where agents interact with each other to perform complex tasks. For example, an [[openais_model_and_agent_developments | OpenAI]] agent starter kit can be paired with an app-building tool like Repl to autonomously create software at speeds far exceeding human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for specialized agents (e.g., an app builder) to be prompted by generalist agents, leading to powerful, nested AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

This trend, where AI models and tools are rapidly improving, will augment the capabilities of crypto-native agents, transforming them from simple chatbots into infinitely more powerful entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### BitTensor's Role
BitTensor is an AI-focused Layer 1 blockchain that coordinates activities to improve AI components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. It enables the development of various AI applications, from providing compute to hosting agent applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. BitTensor recently underwent a major upgrade, "Dynamic Tao," which gives each AI application on its network its own subnet token, paired with the underlying TAO token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This new mechanism massively improves the distribution of TAO rewards to actual development teams, incentivizing them to build powerful and nuanced applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

BitTensor aims to democratize access to cutting-edge AI development by providing substantial funding (estimated at $1.2 billion annually) for teams to build from the ground up, thereby advancing the [[open_source_movement_in_ai_and_crypto | open source AI movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. Several prominent projects, including Kaido and News Research, have utilized BitTensor subnets to conduct their research and build their open-source components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### AI16z (Eliza OS) Road Map
AI16z, now rebranded as Eliza OS, is restructuring to focus on building an [[open_source_movement_in_ai_and_crypto | agent-powered social trading layer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This layer will allow groups to deploy agents that execute trades based on their chat discussions, with agents learning and becoming autonomous over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. These social groups and their agents will earn a reputation or trust score based on their trading success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.

Eliza OS is also planning an "Agent Marketplace," which will serve as an official Launchpad for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. This marketplace aims to encourage multi-agent interaction and value exchange, potentially functioning as a platform for microservices or an "app store" for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. It will feature a custom-built liquidity pool (LP) design to prevent sniping and will partner with high-quality teams for launches, signaling a move towards more curated and higher-quality agent deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

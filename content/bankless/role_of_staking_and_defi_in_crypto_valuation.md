Every Layer 1 (L1) blockchain features a native token, commonly referred to as an L1 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The fundamental question for investors is how to value these tokens to understand what drives returns and evaluate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A robust valuation framework is crucial for analysts to determine if an asset is over or undervalued and to compare different blockchains like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The vast majority—around 95%—of the total crypto market cap, which is currently north of $3 trillion, consists of L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, understanding how to value L1 tokens is essentially valuing the entire crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The challenge lies in the fact that [[evaluating_crypto_with_traditional_finance_models|traditional finance models]] do not directly translate to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Crypto Valuation Models

Historically, various methods have been attempted to value L1 tokens:

*   **MV=PQ**: This monetary theory, popular around 2016-2017, centers the valuation of money on its velocity (rate of spending) to equal price times output or nominal GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This approach has largely fallen out of favor for valuing L1 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Stock-to-Flow**: Popularized by Bitcoiners, this model assumes that scarcity, measured by the ratio of existing supply to annual Bitcoin issuance, directly drives value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. While comparable to gold's demand-supply dynamics, it is a very supply-side focused metric that assumes infinite persistent demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Its regression lines have not held up well recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation to Gold**: A more recent approach for Bitcoin, this method compares Bitcoin's potential total addressable market (TAM) to that of gold, which is around $18 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The argument extends to question why the digital version of an asset would not eventually exceed the value of its analog counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Real Economic Value (REV) and its Limitations for L1s

Currently, a consensus among some analysts, notably popularized by Blockworks, uses **Real Economic Value (REV)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. REV measures the total fees users pay to L1 validators, essentially the value validators capture from transaction activity on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Analysts interpret REV as company cash flows and use it in a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value L1 tokens like companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

DCF models, widely used for valuing equities, predict the present value of an asset by summing all future cash flows and incorporating a discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This model is sound for companies that compound or grow a balance sheet of fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

However, a key critique of applying DCF and REV to L1 tokens is that these tokens are not company shares and do not accrue value like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Validators do not collect revenue in non-native currencies; they earn more of their own token (e.g., ETH, SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This creates a circular reference, making a traditional DCF model problematic because it lacks a non-circular fundamental driver to measure value in dollar terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

### The "One Wallet" Test

A quick test to determine if a DCF model applies is to consider what happens if one entity owned the entire supply of an asset:
*   If one person owned all shares of Apple, Apple's value would not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   If one person owned the entire supply of ETH, SOL, or BTC, its value would be zero because there would be no one else to pay fees or conduct transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This illustrates that L1 tokens are a network, and their value is inherently tied to network participation, not just isolated cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### REV's continued relevance for non-L1 assets
While the DCF model is flawed for L1 tokens, it is still applicable for non-L1 assets like [[benefits_of_defi_for_institutions|DeFi]] protocols (e.g., Aave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. These applications generate cash flows by compounding non-native assets, meaning they earn income in currencies other than their own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Measuring on-chain revenue for these protocols is valuable and has helped move crypto valuation away from "dark ages" of pure narrative hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

## L1 Tokens as Money: The Store of Value Primary Use Case

The core thesis for L1 token valuation is that they are **money**, not company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Money is defined as any asset primarily used for payments and as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

L1 tokens fit this definition:
*   **Payments**: All transactions on blockchains are paid for in the native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Store of Value**: L1 tokens are used for staking (taking duration risk to earn yield) and as a deposit asset in [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem|DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

While the word "money" can have baggage, an expansive definition includes commodity money (like copper, if used for payments and hoarding) and L1s as something in between nation-state fiat and commodity money, due to their inherent economy and "tax" system (fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. The "actual usage" of L1 tokens on-chain confirms their monetary status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

For crypto L1 assets, the **store of value (SOV) use case is generally larger and more important than the payments use case** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. This is because:
*   **Payments**: The cost of transactions (blockspace) continuously deflates due to rapid scaling (e.g., Ethereum's blockspace could 100x with ZK rollups), negating value accrual from payment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Demand growth for blockspace is met with increased supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Store of Value**: The supply of native tokens (e.g., ETH) inflates very slowly (e.g., 0.5% to 2% annually, or even deflationary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Demand for SOV is not met with more token supply, leading to price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

The total addressable market (TAM) for digital non-sovereign money is estimated at $45 trillion, compared to $2.5 trillion for current digital crypto money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This includes gold ($19T) and base money of fiat currencies (e.g., USD $5.6T, EUR $5.3T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. This significant TAM represents the bullish potential for crypto as an industry, emphasizing the need for [[valuation_models_for_blockchain_networks|valuation models]] that recognize L1s as money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## Realized Store of Value (RSOV): A New Framework

The **Realized Store of Value (RSOV)** metric is proposed as a more holistic framework to measure the fundamental value of L1 tokens as money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. RSOV is inspired by Bitcoin's "realized cap" metric, which serves as a proxy for the aggregate cost basis of the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Realized cap increases with net inflows of fiat into Bitcoin and decreases with net outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>.

RSOV adapts this principle for smart contract platforms, focusing on two primary drivers of SOV demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>:

1.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens Staked**: Measures the aggregate cost basis of tokens actively staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
2.  **Realized Value of L1 Tokens in DeFi**: Measures the aggregate cost basis of tokens deposited into [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem|DeFi]] protocols (e.g., for liquidity, collateral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

RSOV essentially captures the net daily inflows of dollars into the network that are "staying in the network" through these fundamental use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. It reflects the "buy and hold" behavior (hodling) of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. Unlike market cap, RSOV only increases when there are actual on-chain transactions or real inflows, not merely due to price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.

For example, if 10% of Ether's supply is staked at a $5,000 price when the current price is $2,000, RSOV goes up because it signifies a large sum of money entering the system to buy and hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. This "locked-up" ETH reduces its velocity, making it stagnant and increasing its realized value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### RSOV and REV Interplay

While REV is problematic for L1 valuation on its own, it is elegantly captured within RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. When users transact on a network and pay fees in the native token (REV), and validators hold or compound these earnings, the realized value of staked tokens increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Thus, REV indirectly contributes to RSOV by acting as a "hastening transfer from spenders to savers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

Furthermore, higher REV can lead to higher staking yields. This incentivizes more users to stake their tokens, which in turn increases the realized staking component of RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

## Analyzing L1 Tokens with RSOV

The ratio of an L1 token's market cap to its RSOV indicates how much future growth the market has priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. For instance, if Ethereum has a market cap of $350 billion and an RSOV of $120 billion, the $230 billion gap represents priced-in future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. A very high price-to-RSOV ratio, like SUI's 185x, suggests that the market is making a very large bet on future growth in its [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto|Real Economic Value REV in crypto|store of value]] usage, even if that usage isn't yet reflected on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

### Drivers of RSOV Growth

Factors that increase RSOV for an L1 token include:

*   **Inflows into Staking**: Higher staking yields attract more capital, akin to how higher dollar yields attract global inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. A market perception of lower risk for an asset can also lead to increased demand for its yield, even if the yield itself compresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.
*   **Inflows into DeFi**: More users depositing the native token into [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem|DeFi]] for collateral or liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Growing Asset Issuance on the Network**: The availability of other assets (stablecoins, tokenized BTC) to be paired with the L1 token in [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem|DeFi]] encourages more usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **Monetary Attributes**: Reliable issuance policy, hardened protocol rules, and easy-to-verify chains enhance the appeal of digital crypto money compared to analog government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

A high RSOV represents a "bottom floor" for valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Historically, for Bitcoin, when market cap drops below realized cap, it has often indicated a "screaming buy" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### L1s as Two Products

L1 blockchains can be seen as offering two distinct products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>:
1.  **Blockspace**: Valued based on DCF/REV, with fees tending to compress over time due to scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>.
2.  **Uncensorable, Non-State Store of Value Asset**: Valued by RSOV, driven by long-term holding and utility in the on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>.

The ability of an L1 to be censored (e.g., SUI validators freezing funds) impacts its credibility as a non-sovereign [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem|store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. While the asset may still be considered "money," censorship makes it "bad money," likely leading to a decrease in RSOV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.

This dual nature also explains the tribal dynamics in crypto:
*   **Bitcoin maxis** often prefer minimal utility and focus almost entirely on Bitcoin's [[the_role_of_fundamentals_in_crypto_valuation|monetary base]] and SOV (realized cap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.
*   **Other L1 communities** (e.g., Solana) often emphasize high transaction volumes and REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
*   **Ethereum** often aims to do both, seeking both the "burn" (from fees, impacting supply) and strong SOV properties, which can be complex for some to reconcile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.

From an RSOV perspective, all L1s accrue value similarly through net inflows of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>. A lower staking yield for an L1 token compared to others may indicate that the market perceives lower monetary risk, increasing demand for that yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>.

Ultimately, L1 tokens are fundamentally commodities used as money, and cannot be valued by DCF models like equities. Trying to apply DCF to them is "fitting a square peg in a round hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. The world of finance includes many assets like gold, oil, or fiat currencies that cannot be DCF-valued, and L1s are among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

For more information and to explore the RSOV framework, analysts can access Dune Dashboards and an Excel template provided in the show notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>.

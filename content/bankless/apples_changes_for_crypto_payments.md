A recent US district court ruling has significantly altered Apple's iOS App Store guidelines, opening new avenues for cryptocurrency payments and integration [00:14:50]. This decision comes after a prolonged legal battle challenging Apple's restrictive commerce policies.

## Background on Apple's Control
Apple has historically maintained a "strong chokehold on the commerce inside of its own iOS ecosystem" [00:13:59]. This control included a 30% tax on all in-app purchases [00:14:09].

In 2021, a court ordered Apple to permit developers to direct users outside the App Store for purchases via "regular links and buttons" [00:14:17]. However, Apple implemented this by charging a 27% fee for these external purchases and displaying "very hostile pop-ups" [00:14:39] that discouraged users with warnings like, "We can't protect you here. There might be scams here" [00:14:45]. This implementation was later deemed "compliance theater" [00:15:06].

The initial legal challenge originated from the Epic Games vs. Apple lawsuit in August 2020, where Epic intentionally added a direct pay button to Fortnite to bypass Apple's 30% tax, leading to Fortnite's delisting and Epic taking Apple to court [01:16:17].

## The New Ruling and Its Impact
The US district court found that Apple "willfully violated" the previous injunction [01:14:50], forcing comprehensive changes to its guidelines [01:14:53]. As a result of these changes:
*   Applications can now include "clean speak buttons" directing users to purchase goods off-site [01:19:19].
*   Apps are permitted to state that off-site purchases are "30% cheaper" [01:25:25].
*   Apple is prohibited from displaying "discouraging pop-ups" to prevent users from making external purchases [01:27:29].

## Implications for Crypto
These changes represent a significant win for the crypto industry [01:12:00]:
*   **Direct Crypto Payments:** Apps in the App Store can now directly accept crypto payments without routing through Apple's system [01:17:05]. This enables mobile wallets to facilitate direct spending of cryptocurrencies like USDC, ETH, and Solana, avoiding extra fees [01:17:11].
*   **NFT Marketplace Functionality:** Mobile apps for NFT marketplaces, like OpenSea, can now allow the direct buying and selling of NFTs. Previously, OpenSea's app was "browse only" [01:37:39] because enabling transactions would lead to delisting [01:16:09]. Users can now be pointed "outbound to your wallet" to buy NFTs without the 30% in-app fee [01:59:00].
*   **NFT-Gated Features:** Apps can now gate functionality or feature sets via NFTs [01:31:00], which was previously disallowed by Apple [01:42:00].

This ruling enables crypto assets to have increased utility within the App Store ecosystem, moving beyond a perception of being "useless except for like scams and frauds" [01:53:00], a limitation often attributed to regulatory hurdles and platform restrictions [01:57:00].

## Broader Commentary
The changes reflect a move towards greater interoperability and user-controlled ownership within digital ecosystems. This aligns with a long-held belief in the crypto community that digital assets should be portable and have real-world utility [01:52:00].

> "If we had a standards body standardize what our portable outfit fits in games, game outfits you could buy in one game that work in another, then you could have an item economy where every game agrees to respect each other's item purchases of uh of that sort and revenue is shared between the ecosystems as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>
> â€” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games

While some traditional gaming companies like Epic, Meta, and Microsoft are exploring interoperability standards through forums like the "metaverse standards forum" [01:17:00], they struggle to agree on revenue sharing for a creator economy worth hundreds of millions of dollars [01:37:00]. This is due to the lack of "portable property" [01:06:06] and a "credibly neutral property rights system" [01:08:00], which blockchain-based NFTs can provide. This suggests that NFT-based games are "just ahead of its time" [01:24:00], aligning with the idea that the crypto community was "not wrong" but "just early" [01:27:00].

The "AI Rollup" podcast, hosted by David Hoffman and E.J., frequently explores the emerging trends and developments at the [[Intersection of AI and Crypto | intersection of AI and crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article discusses Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) and insights into [[Investment strategies and capital movements in AI tokens | investment strategies]] in the [[AI in the Crypto Space | crypto AI]] sector, particularly from Tom Shaughnessy of Deli Digital.

## Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs)

Reserve Protocol has introduced Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs), which are designed as crypto equivalents of ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These DTFs offer indices across various sectors within the crypto space, including real-world assets, DeFi, and even [[AI and crypto integration | AI agents]] and virtuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Deli Digital's Investment in AI

Deli Digital has been investing in [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI]] for a significant period, well before the [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI agent]] meta took root in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. They have been active in the [[Intersection of AI and Crypto | crypto AI intersection]] for over two years, observing multiple waves of [[Investment strategies and capital movements in AI tokens | investment cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Initial Conviction and Thesis
Deli Digital began its [[Investment opportunities in crypto AI | investment]] in the [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI crypto space]] over two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, facing internal pushback as it was not yet seen as a viable sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Tom Shaughnessy's initial interest stemmed from an "existential crisis" after using Midjourney and early ChatGPT, leading him to believe that AI would "take over the world" and necessitated investment exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Initially, the thesis was that [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI]] represented the "new tech wave" and an "explosion" of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Over time, this thesis evolved into a core principle: the desire to avoid a future where a single centralized model, such as one controlled by Sam Altman, dictates daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This conviction led to a focus on the open-source [[AI and crypto integration | crypto AI]] movement across the entire technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Integration of Crypto in AI
Two years ago, the idea of crypto being relevant in the AI stack was contrarian, given that large [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI labs]] possessed all the GPUs, talent, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. However, the core tenets of crypto provided a compelling alternative:
*   **Decentralized Development** Instead of small, top-down labs, crypto enables millions of developers globally to raise funds quickly and create new [[AI and crypto integration | AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Lowered Barrier to Entry** Unlike DeFi, which required coding knowledge, the [[Integration of AI in cryptocurrency | AI crypto space]] allows individuals to launch tokens and build startups using tools like Claude or OpenAI without needing to code, significantly lowering the barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Initial [[Investment strategies and capital movements in AI tokens | investments]] focused on "deepins" (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) related to compute and unused hardware clustering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Deli Digital's investment strategy progressed from the bottom of the stack (inference players, compute providers, distributed training projects like Noose Research and Prime Intellect) upwards to middleware, inference, and eventually application layers like Mycell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Waves of Investment Cycles in Crypto AI
While Deli Digital's investment strategy moved from the bottom up, the market's virality has played out in the opposite direction, with agents at the top leveraging closed-source models and infrastructure, then backing into open-source solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The **liquid side** of the market was initiated by Bit Tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. On the **venture/private deal side**, early [[Investment opportunities in crypto AI | investments]] concentrated on compute networks, inference plays, and decentralized training projects, such as Noose Research and Prime Intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This was followed by a focus on **coordination networks** like Laura, Sentient, and Morpheus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The most recent wave has been dominated by **agents and models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

A key observation is the shift from "reply bot infinite slot bots," which are predicted to go to zero, towards utility-based, functional agents that perform specific tasks like trading, managing DeFi protocols, or managing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. An example of this is Billy Bets, an agent that manages 100K in its book for betting on NBA games, powered by a Bit Tensor subnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Evolution of Investment Thesis in 2025
The thesis has evolved significantly since 2022-2023. Previously, there was substantial skepticism about the ability of open-source [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI]] to compete with large [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI labs]] due to their superior access to GPUs and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. However, the emergence of projects like Deep Seek, an open-source reasoning model capable of internet searching before even Anthropic, demonstrated that the dominance of closed-source labs could be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The core belief now is that [[AI in the Crypto Space | crypto AI]] does not necessarily need to "beat" OpenAI; rather, it thrives by providing open-source models that individuals can use to create projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Value Accrual: Centralized vs. Open-Source AI
Currently, closed-source [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI labs]] (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity) hold significantly higher valuations, being worth hundreds of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. These labs are expected to continue leading in foundational model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

However, on the **open-source side**, it's anticipated that they will win on the application layer due to the ability of developers worldwide to iterate on consumer-level applications and agents at an unparalleled scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The challenge for open-source remains data acquisition, especially personalized data, which is crucial for model training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

The **monetization layer** of long-tail, applied models seems to fit well with crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Crypto's capital markets allow for extremely fast [[Investment strategies and capital movements in AI tokens | innovation cycles]], quickly identifying and discarding non-utility-based projects like reply bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Bridging Silicon Valley AI and Crypto AI
A significant challenge for crypto is attracting traditional [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI developers]] from Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Reasons why they might transition include:
*   **Freedom**: The ability to run simulations and experiments without top-down directives or alignment restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Fundraising**: The ease of raising funds overnight within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Global Collaboration**: Networking with developers worldwide rather than only within a core group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

While Silicon Valley [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI developers]] are currently well-compensated in the "AI arms race," the perceived lack of monetary incentive in open source has been a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. However, high valuations of crypto AI projects are starting to attract interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

The "S-curve" of AI arms race sophistication is still accelerating, with significant advancements occurring monthly, as seen with Deep Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. This rapid pace means that models can be surpassed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. The departure of OpenAI co-founders to create competitors also suggests that the "moat" of leading [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI labs]] may not be as strong as once thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

[[Integration of AI in cryptocurrency | Crypto AI]] is envisioned as the "longtail" or periphery of the [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI]] sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. Just as Uniswap provided liquidity for a long tail of assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, crypto AI will enable a vast array of niche, applied models. This environment allows for the tokenization of countless smaller companies (e.g., millions of $1-$10 million companies) compared to the fewer, larger billion-dollar companies in traditional Silicon Valley [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. The open-source nature of crypto provides a "canvas" for orchestration and scaling, with continuous improvements in transaction costs and microtransactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

### Future Themes and Investment Criteria
Deli Digital has made 20 [[Investment opportunities in crypto AI | crypto investments]] in the past two years across the entire stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Key areas of excitement for the [[Future trends in AI crypto sector | future of AI crypto]] include:
*   **Distributed Training**: Projects like Noose Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Models for Agents**: Agents that leverage advanced reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Frameworks**: Open-source frameworks like AI 16z and Arc, which attract developers and foster creativity, particularly on platforms like Solana and Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.
*   **Utility-focused Agents**: Agents that fully lean into technology and gaming, such as Virtuals with their Agentic Commerce Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

Deli Digital's investment framework for [[Investment opportunities in crypto AI | crypto AI]] projects, adapted from Mythos VC, focuses on five key areas:
1.  **Proprietary Model**: A differentiated model, potentially trained on specific data (e.g., bankless data), or a new architecture like Deep Seek, or a fine-tuned version of existing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
2.  **Proprietary Data**: Unique data to train a use case not already available on the internet, which can be very valuable for the end model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
3.  **Business Integration**: Strategic integrations that provide full distribution (e.g., a chatbot integrated with Uniswap or an agent working with Google Sheets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
4.  **Proprietary Tooling/Frameworks**: Unique tools that enable agents to perform specific actions, such as creating wallets or posting on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
5.  **Inference Time Compute**: Optimizations for how models think and process information, allowing for longer or different reasoning pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

Deals are quickly passed if founders lack real [[AI in the Crypto Space | AI experience]], as the fast-moving nature of the space demands strong founder bets capable of pivoting with AI changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

Deli Digital even uses an internal [[AI and crypto integration | AI agent]] to process deals, analyze investment committee documents, and perform reference checks on founders via platforms like Perplexity, identifying red flags such as fraud or prison records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

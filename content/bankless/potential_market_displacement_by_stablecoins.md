The development of valuable [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] is currently estimated to be only 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite this early stage, [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] are seen as having the potential to significantly displace traditional financial services, particularly in the vast payments market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Market Opportunity

The global [[Stablecoins in crossborder payments | crossborder payments]] market is valued at an estimated $200 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Currently, [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] facilitate approximately $50 billion in [[Stablecoins in crossborder payments | crossborder transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For this specific use case, [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] are considered functionally and unequivocally superior to traditional methods, provided certain [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure problems]] are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

A significant portion of this market, particularly the Small and Medium Business (SMB) segment, which accounts for about 40% of the $200 trillion, is expected to be better served by [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] and [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Challenges for Adoption

For widespread adoption and full realization of their potential, [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]] must overcome several [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure challenges]]:
*   **Compliance Concerns**: Addressing [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | compliance concerns]] is critical for legitimacy and broad acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Ensuring sufficient liquidity is necessary to handle large transaction volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Further reducing transaction costs will enhance their competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Last-Mile Solution**: Developing effective "last-mile" solutions is essential for seamless integration into daily commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Impact on Existing Players

Companies like Wise, which operate in the [[Stablecoins in crossborder payments | crossborder payments]] space and aim to capture a share of the estimated $50 trillion in related revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, represent the type of business that could be significantly affected by the rise of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]].

> "Wise is a great business. It is a business that is capital inefficient that requires a lot of interconnectivity with the [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_financial_systems_and_fintech | banking system]] that requires a lot of operational connectivity that would not need to happen if it was on [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stable coin rails]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The capital inefficiency and heavy reliance on existing [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_financial_systems_and_fintech | banking system]] interconnectivity of traditional payment services highlight their vulnerabilities to disruption by [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Such companies may need to adopt [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin]] technology themselves or risk displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Coordination mechanisms play a vital role in defining and maintaining the identity and purpose of cryptocurrency assets and their respective communities. These mechanisms often involve establishing social "red lines" and agreed-upon norms for communication and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Approach to Social Coordination

The [[cultural_differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin community]] has successfully implemented social coordination around defining the BTC asset as a fundamental store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This includes behaviors such as shaming individuals for creating too many tokens or any tokens, and for referring to non-Bitcoin assets as "coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strict adherence to terminology and asset definition serves as a [[Communication Mechanisms in Finance | coordination mechanism]] that benefits the BTC asset by clearly delineating its perceived role and discouraging alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The analogy used is akin to insisting on a single leader, like the president of the United States, to prevent confusion and maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Ethereum's Coordination Challenge

Historically, the [[Ethereums Leadership and Community Dynamics | Ethereum community]] has been characterized as "too nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which, while beneficial in some aspects, has hindered its ability to establish clear, universally accepted "red lines" for its asset and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

For Ethereum to succeed, it is crucial to:
*   **Define "red lines"**: Identify specific areas where the community must be uncompromising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Achieve consensus**: The community must agree on these defined "red lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Without widespread agreement, the community risks appearing disorganized and out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Specifically, it is important to ensure that Ethereum is recognized and utilized as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Furthermore, the underlying Ethereum technology, as a settlement layer, must be firmly established as the "fundamental ledger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Failure to achieve these points of social and technical coordination could result in significant setbacks for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This emphasizes the role of [[Decentralization governance and Ethereums leadership dynamics | decentralized governance and leadership dynamics]] in shaping community consensus.

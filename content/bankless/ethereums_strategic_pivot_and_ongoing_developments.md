The [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum]] ecosystem is currently undergoing a strategic shift, with a "renewed [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum]] focus" emerging in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:13">[02:26:13]</a>. This shift follows a period where the direction of [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum]] "hasn't felt aligned with what the universe wants or what the universe expects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:23">[02:26:23]</a>.

## A Realigned Future
In the last six months, [[Ethereums strategic pivot and community reactions | Ethereum]] has been "realigning itself to a new future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:23">[02:26:23]</a>, essentially undergoing a "reboot" similar to Ryan Sean Adams' personal hiatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>. This realignment creates an opportunity for platforms like Bankless to "support [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum]]" once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:49">[02:26:49]</a>.

### Layer 1 Prioritization
A key aspect of this pivot is the assertion of strength from the Layer 1 (L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. The Layer 1 is "putting itself first," a strategy likened to putting on an oxygen mask in a plane before assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. This indicates a reprioritization of the core [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Ethereum]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

### Technical Developments
Vitalik Buterin has been discussing an "execution layer plan for the EVM," even suggesting the possibility of replacing the EVM with Risk Zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Market Performance and Challenges
Despite the internal pivot, the broader [[Ethereum ecosystem and leadership changes | Ethereum]] ecosystem has faced challenges in the market. Since January 16th, ETH/USD has seen a significant decrease of 48%, falling from $3,400 to $1,750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:13">[03:31:13]</a>. The entire [[Ethereum ecosystem and leadership changes | Ethereum]] ecosystem is "down fairly bad relative to Bitcoin and Soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:32">[03:34:32]</a>.

One perspective suggests that [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ether]] is "losing the Midame" and has "fallen behind on the global store of value reserve asset like conversation narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:03">[04:00:03]</a>. This narrative suggests that while [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum]] excels in building and innovation, it "has not built the meme base layer," the "cult," or the "religion" that Bitcoin has, which is seen as a problem for becoming a global store of value asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. If [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ether]] is to see material price appreciation in the future, it needs to regain this ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:22">[04:02:22]</a>.

However, it's also posited that it's "not over for [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ether]] at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. The "immaculate conception" story of Bitcoin contributes to its perceived credible neutrality, which is not shared by [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum]] due to the "mere existence of Vitalic Buterine and is like s like more like the [[Ethereum ecosystem and leadership changes | Ethereum]] foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:08">[03:59:08]</a>. Despite this, it's argued that "there are different types of religions that you can form," and Bitcoin's strength "does not preclude [[Ethereums future strategic direction | ether]] from becoming a global like monetary asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:46">[03:59:46]</a>.

### Community and Culture
There are ongoing discussions within the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and community reactions | Ethereum]] community about what "it needs to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. One perspective suggests that while the community builds technically, it needs to work on building its "meme base layer," "cult," and "religion" to become a global store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. This is contrasted with Bitcoin's "religious victory" that involved grassroots efforts to sway political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>.

The [[Ethereums strategic pivot and community reactions | Ethereum]] community is also observed to be "opting out" of direct political alignment efforts, unlike some other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:23">[03:52:23]</a>.

Overall, the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum]] strategic pivot and Bitcoin's elevation to a non-sovereign store of value are considered "the two most interesting stories in crypto right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

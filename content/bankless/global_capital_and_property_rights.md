## The Traditional Financial System: A "Patchwork of Siloed Servers"

The current global financial system is characterized by "finance in silo databases that communicate over the internet occasionally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This contrasts with a true "internet financial system" where financial activities and assets natively exist on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Limitations of the Traditional System
This "mesh network loosely cohered topology of siloed servers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> creates significant friction and limits growth due to:

*   **High Transaction Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>: Communicating across disparate servers is cumbersome and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. For example, transferring Apple stock between brokerages like Robinhood and Fidelity requires multiple layers of approvals and intermediaries at the Depository Trust Company (DTC) level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Similarly, transferring land in less developed countries can involve flying there, hiring lawyers, and navigating complex legal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. These high costs are a result of transactions being communicated rather than executed directly on open, unified ledgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **High Barriers to Entry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>: The existing financial system is permissioned, meaning new entrants cannot innovate or try new things without explicit authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The number of new FDIC-insured commercial banks, for instance, dropped to zero after 2009, reflecting these barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Local Banking Oligopolies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>: Banking benefits from significant economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. In most countries, the five largest banks hold over 50% of the market share, acting as gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. These oligopolies tend to "underprovision loans and overprice the loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
    *   **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: The spread between what banks borrow at and what they lend at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. In less developed financial systems, NIMs can be 5 to 10 points higher than in more developed systems, sometimes even reaching 20 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This high cost of capital permeates the entire economy, leading to higher mortgage rates, fewer houses sold, fewer small businesses, and less employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This directly impacts [[legal_and_financial_systems | legal and financial systems]] by stifling capital formation.

## The Promise of the Internet Financial System (IFS)

The "internet financial system" is a paradigm shift that aims to create "a better financial system on the cloud that can hold the world's assets and provide financial services to 8 billion people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It encompasses concepts like blockchain and DeFi, but is best understood as a system where actual databases and ledgers holding assets exist on the open internet, accessible to anyone with root access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Redefining [[Ownership Tracking in Finance Systems | Ownership]]
In traditional finance, [[ownership_tracking_in_finance_systems | ownership tracking in finance systems]] is often confined to siloed databases, such as a startup's Excel spreadsheet or a brokerage's internal server for stock ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In less advanced economies, land ownership might literally exist on a rolled-up map in a physical office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The IFS introduces a unified, permissionless server where "anybody in the world has root access to those databases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This enables more efficient and accessible [[ownership_tracking_in_finance_systems | ownership tracking in finance systems]] and strong property rights for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Servers with Laws: The Foundation of IFS

A core component of the IFS is the concept of a "server with laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. This refers to scalable servers that interact with their own predefined rules and smart contract code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

*   **Credible Commitments**: This technology provides "credible commitments," meaning the system can credibly guarantee certain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Without a server subject to a set of laws, it would be vulnerable to corruption and misuse, preventing the development of a unified asset ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Smart Contracts**: Smart contract code enables assets to be put into contracts that execute logic like a vending machine, unlocking efficiencies and new application designs not possible in the traditional banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Examples include royalty contracts that stream payments every time a song is played, or companies issuing revenue-share tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.
*   **Unified Servers**: Instead of millions of siloed servers, blockchains represent "single unified servers that unlocks financial efficiency and access and strong property rights for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This inversion means a shift from trying to make disparate servers communicate to a single, credible, technologically proven server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

## Impact on Global Property Rights and Capital Flow

The internet financial system, with its "servers with laws," has profound implications for global property rights and capital flow.

*   **Addressing Weak Property Rights**: The majority of the world lives under weak rule of law, with average property rights scores of 43 (compared to 95 in countries like the US or Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. In such regimes, cases can be decided by bribes, property can be expropriated, and agreements may not be honored, preventing capital formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.
    *   **Bitcoin as a Precedent**: Bitcoin was the first "credible commitment server" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>, offering a real property right to people in countries with weak rule of law by guaranteeing a fixed supply and preventing double-spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   **[[Tokenization of Private Securities and its Opportunities | Tokenization]] of US Assets**: The potential for US assets like stocks (e.g., Apple, Nvidia) and stablecoins to be [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenized]] on-chain allows people worldwide to access strong US property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. This has "profound implications for saving rates of people across the world," as their local currencies often deflate significantly against the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This contributes to the narrative of [[cryptocurrency_as_global_reserve_asset | cryptocurrency as a global reserve asset]].
    *   **Empowering Nations to Strengthen Laws**: Countries with weak rule of law can use internet finance tools, such as putting land registries on-chain as NFTs, to strengthen their own property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. This can attract capital into high-return opportunities in emerging markets that are currently impeded by poor capital flow and weak rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

*   **Global Capital Flows**: The traditional system struggles with connecting capital to opportunities across borders due to intermediaries and high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. For example, a Dubai fund seeking 8% returns cannot easily access Colombian auto loans yielding 20% due to multiple intermediaries and local bank gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. With a unified internet finance database, the Colombian dealer could directly raise loans on the open internet, reducing costs and enabling more efficient global capital allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. This unhindered flow of capital, especially in emerging markets, is essential for economic growth and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

## Navigating the Intersection of Blockchain and Nation-State Law

The emergence of "servers with laws" creates a new dynamic with traditional nation-state laws. While the server itself is immune to external forces (e.g., nation-states cannot change Bitcoin's laws) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, human users and physical entities are subject to local jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.

*   **Adaptation, Not Replacement**: Just as driving laws evolved with the invention of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>, governments will adapt and layer their legal systems on top of internet finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Cooperation for Growth**: A huge blossoming of potential and value emerges when blockchain legal systems and nation-state [[legal_and_financial_systems | legal and financial systems]] cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. The favorable regulatory environment in the US, particularly regarding stablecoins and Real World Asset (RWA) [[tokenization_of_private_securities_and_its_opportunities | tokenization]], is seen as a crucial step for the [[impact_of_foreign_capital_exit_on_US_markets | US market]] to further lower its cost of capital and increase dollar dominance globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.
*   **The Problem of Trust**: Historically, the world hasn't developed a unified server for all assets because no one party was trusted with global assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. Blockchains, through their credible commitments, overcome this trust barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Internet Finance as a Civilizational Step Forward

The internet financial system, by enabling strong property rights and free flow of capital across borders, is viewed as a "civilizational coordination technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. It is expected to significantly increase GDP growth and the development of underdeveloped countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. The shift from a speculative, zero-interest-rate-driven industry to one focused on real products and utility is essential for this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

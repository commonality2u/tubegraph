From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Meme coins have emerged as a significant and often controversial phenomenon within the cryptocurrency industry. While their rise has been meteoric, driven by cultural trends and speculative interest, their [[impact_of_memecoins_on_the_crypto_market | economic implications]] and broader reputational effects on crypto remain a subject of intense debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Bankless's Stance and Initial Hesitation
Bankless, a prominent crypto podcast, has historically not been a strong advocate for [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]], primarily due to their "inert nature" and "destructive Market behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The podcast's host expressed caution about platforming Pump.fun, a leading meme coin launchpad, given the industry's recent "most extractive Market Cycles" which left a "trail of destroyed Capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The host also questioned whether Pump.fun might be attempting to "launder its reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The comparison was made to "Operation Berkshire," a historical conspiracy by big tobacco to deny health risks and undermine scientific consensus for market growth, raising the possibility that [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] could be "inherently stuck being something like tobacco for public health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, the future is not yet written, and there's a potential for more productive [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Pump.fun's Role and Market Evolution
Pump.fun, launched in January 2024, is a meme coin launchpad on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It rapidly gained traction, peaking at over 60,000 token launches per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Since its launch, approximately 9 million total tokens have been introduced on the platform, with about 15 million unique addresses interacting with Pump.fun tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Pump.fun charges a 1% fee on trades through its bonding curve model, generating an "astounding $600 million of Revenue" for the company and its investors, making it "one of the most wildly successful applications in the crypto space in recent times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Pre-Pump.fun Era
Before Pump.fun, creating [[the_role_of_meme_coins_and_celebrity_influence_in_cryptocurrency | meme coins]] often involved pre-sales where individuals would send funds to a wallet address posted on Twitter, trusting the individual to launch the coin and add liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This process was prone to issues, with coins often not launching or creators reserving large portions of funds for "marketing" (which was seen as unnecessary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Trading on AMMs or DEXs was also problematic, with issues like liquidity pulls, honeypots, and wallet drains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Pump.fun addressed these issues by simplifying the token creation process and providing baseline security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>:
*   No upfront capital needed to create a coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Liquidity for the bonding curve is used to create a burned liquidity pool once enough capital is committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   All permissions are revoked from the coin creator once the coin is launched, making it "truly permissionless [and] truly immutable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Cultural Implications
The host noted Pump.fun's "4chan aesthetic and energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Allan, Pump.fun's co-founder, explained that this was initially a practical choice due to ease of building, but they stuck with it because the "best meme coins" often originated on 4chan, and their users resonated with the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. He emphasized retaining this "rich culture" to avoid becoming "another Web Two product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

### Reputation and Moderation Challenges
The proliferation of [[the_role_of_meme_coins_and_celebrity_influence_in_cryptocurrency | meme coins]] has led to a tarnished reputation for crypto, potentially the "worst that it's ever been in mainstream maybe since FTX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This is attributed to the "structural and systematized extraction" seen in the meme coin market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

> [!warning] Criticisms and Reputational Challenges of Meme Coins
> "The memecoin sector has created just an immense amount of pain for the crypto industry as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, leading to a "deep delegitimizing of the seriousness of the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Allan acknowledged that Pump.fun played a "significant role in expanding the ecosystem" by making participation simpler and providing security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. However, he argued that [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] are not "at fault" for crypto's perceived lack of utility over 15 years, suggesting that crypto has "failed to come up with compelling use cases for users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

The platform faced significant moderation challenges, particularly with live streams where "nefarious behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a> occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. Allan admitted they "fucked up" on moderation and were not transparent enough about their guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. The live stream feature was eventually removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, demonstrating that Pump.fun can exert influence over user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

## Economic Implications and Sustainability
Pump.fun's success highlights a demand for "app Builders" over "infrastructure Builders" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. However, the economic model of [[meme_coins_and_their_risk_of_grift | meme coins]] often involves creators selling their tokens, creating a misalignment of incentives with holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>. This can lead to "rugs" or "dumps" that "nuke the token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

### Pump Swap and Creator Revenue Sharing
Pump.fun introduced **Pump Swap**, a native Automated Market Maker (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This move verticalizes Pump.fun's ecosystem, replacing the previous reliance on external AMMs like Raydium for token graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

> [!info] Vision for Pump Swap
> The main reasons for launching Pump Swap are to simplify the on-chain experience for users and to align incentives between coin creators and holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

A key innovation for [[future_directions_and_sustainability_of_meme_coins | sustainability]] is **Creator Revenue Sharing**, which is planned for Pump Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This mechanism allows creators to earn a portion of swap volumes, incentivizing them to "keep their coin in the news [and] keep it relevant for as long as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>. This means creators could potentially have zero tokens but still be incentivized to work on a project through trading volume fees, aligning them more with holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This could transform [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] from "inert Financial assets to something with like a growth plan...an actual real business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Pump.fun aims to make the product more sustainable and ensure it survives "multiple Cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. They believe the market is "this Almighty beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, and while some outcomes are unavoidable, they can improve mechanisms and incentives.

Allan believes that [[the_impact_and_potential_of_meme_ai_coins_versus_frameworkbased_ai_coins | meme coins]] provide value beyond mere financial speculation, offering entertainment or serving as a way to "bootstrap attention for your idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. He cited projects like "Griffin" (a chat GPT for Solana blockchain) as an example of a valuable product that used a meme coin launch for distribution and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

> [!tip] Meme Coins as Attention Units
> Allan views [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] as "attention units that you can trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a> and a "good measure of attention" for how trending certain topics or news events are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>. This ties into the concept of a complex interplay between news, content, attention, and markets, similar to PolyMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

Despite concerns about the high failure rate (only four of 8.7 million tokens launched by Pump.fun maintain over $100 million market cap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, Allan argued that meme coins, like NFTs, retain value even after market downturns and that they will continue to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. He challenged listeners to argue why the historical pattern of meme coin behavior would suddenly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

The mission of Pump.fun is seen as interconnected goals of increasing trading volume, fostering more token launches, and ultimately increasing user wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. Lowering the barrier to entry for token creation (e.g., from 10-20 Solana to almost nothing) massively increases the chance of "good things just taking place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>, such as innovative projects gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

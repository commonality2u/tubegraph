Starting a company, especially in the crypto space, presents a unique set of challenges and demands a diverse range of skills from its founders. Insights from successful crypto builders reveal common themes of resilience, adaptability, and a deep understanding of both technology and people.

## The Nature of Building in Crypto

Building is often an innate drive, cultivated from a young age through small endeavors like running a snow shoveling business [00:03:25]. The ability to code can open up a world of possibilities for creating apps and putting them on the internet for public use [00:03:34].

### Core Mindsets and Skills

*   **Optimism and Determination** A fundamental mindset for a builder is one of optimism and determination, as building involves frequent roadblocks, difficulties, and skepticism from others [00:06:08].
*   **Resilience** Founders must possess the resilience to "keep building and keep putting one foot in front of the other" even when facing adversity [00:06:21].
*   **Communication** Finding an effective way to communicate about what is being built is crucial. This allows others to join the journey and offer support [00:06:35].
*   **Scrappy, T-shaped Individuals** The most successful builders are "scrappy," "t-shaped" individuals. They have deep expertise in one area (e.g., app development) but are also broad thinkers who can holistically assemble different pieces to get things done, even if they aren't experts in every area [00:07:37].
*   **Grit and Outsourcing** In the early stages, founders must "grit it out" and handle all tasks themselves, including unglamorous ones like taxes or accounting [00:08:22]. This hard work builds an understanding of what constitutes good results, enabling effective outsourcing as the business grows [00:08:56].
*   **Time Management & Shipping Fast** Effectively managing time and identifying high-leverage activities are critical, especially for early-stage companies [00:10:01]. A key principle is that "action produces information" [00:11:10]. It is better to ship quickly and learn from rapid feedback loops than to get stuck in indecision [00:11:24]. Building with speed enables the meta-skill of continuous learning and intuition development [00:11:55].

### Who Can Be a Builder?

Anyone can be a builder, not just coders. This includes those who build communities, art, or even their on-chain identity [00:05:43]. Tools are continuously improving, allowing individuals to create impactful things without extensive technical know-how [00:05:55].

## Key Lessons from Experienced Founders

Experienced founders share profound insights drawn from their journeys, emphasizing people, product, and the unique environment of crypto.

### People and Culture

*   **Surrounding Yourself with Better People** Success in business is fundamentally about the people around you [00:17:25]. Founders should constantly seek individuals who are better than them in various domains and empower them to create and communicate [00:17:42].
*   **Importance of Values** Having a strong value system that people are held to is crucial for shaping the "character" and "DNA" of a company or protocol [00:19:03].
*   **"Hire Slow, Fire Fast"** It's essential to be deliberate and take your time when hiring [00:21:47]. However, if a hiring mistake is made and the individual becomes a "virus" within the "organism" of the company, it's vital to address it quickly to prevent negative impacts on morale and effectiveness [00:22:04].
*   **Delegation and Trust** As a company grows, founders must delegate tasks, including hiring, to others [00:24:41]. This requires significant trust and a focus on hiring executives who can build and scale teams while upholding company values [00:27:54].
*   **Keeping Teams Lean** Especially in the early stages, it's important to keep teams as lean as possible [01:00:56]. Over-hiring, often influenced by fundraising events, can be premature, particularly before a product achieves recurring revenue [01:01:02].
*   **Investing in People and Culture** The more a founder invests in people and culture, the more it pays off, building trust and enabling more effective delegation aligned with established values [01:03:01].
*   **Interpersonal Coordination Challenges** As teams cross certain thresholds (e.g., 25-30 people), managing interpersonal coordination and cooperation becomes a significant, often unexpected, time investment for founders [01:21:55].
*   **People Problems in Scaling** A large amount of time and mental energy is spent on "people problems"â€”managing careers, promotions, communication, power dynamics, and compensation frameworks [01:38:20]. Hiring a skilled Head of People is strongly recommended to manage these complexities [01:39:15].
*   **Recruiting vs. Team Building** Founders often prioritize recruiting talent (getting good people in the door) over deliberate team building (creating a strategy and structure for how the team operates) [01:40:34]. This can lead to significant problems if not carefully considered [01:41:00].
*   **Importance of Co-founder Relationship** The co-founder relationship is akin to a marriage and is critical for success [01:43:19]. Founders should pick co-founders with integrity, intelligence, and energy, as this relationship cannot easily be changed [01:42:51].
*   **Missionaries vs. Mercenaries** Being mission-oriented attracts "missionaries" (people deeply committed to the cause) rather than "mercenaries" (those primarily motivated by financial gain) [01:49:53]. Missionaries are more effective, especially given competitive compensation in the crypto space [01:49:58].
*   **Team Attitude** Maintaining a positive team attitude is vital, as "it all it takes is one person to drag your team down as far as like having negative attitude" [02:04:46].

### Product and Strategy

*   **Start Small, Find Excitement** Founders should find a domain they are excited about and start by building the smallest possible thing [00:04:23]. Great products often begin as small experiments aligned with personal interests, gradually growing into something bigger [00:04:47].
*   **Iterative Building and Learning from Failure** Failure is a valuable learning opportunity, provided one can quickly learn from it [01:18:51]. A pragmatic approach involves building iteratively, delivering something, and then continuously improving it [01:11:11]. This means planning for failure and being willing to "cut your losses" when data indicates something isn't working [01:18:56].
*   **Focus with Limited Resources** Startups with limited resources often perform better than those with unlimited ones because it forces focus [00:39:33]. A successful strategy can involve focusing on a very small, niche area and perfecting it, drawing in users despite imperfections in other areas [00:38:38].
*   **Shared Trauma Builds Resilience** Overcoming significant challenges, such as the FTX collapse for Solana, can create "shared trauma" that purges less committed individuals and strengthens the bonds and resilience of the core builder community [00:39:54].
*   **Balancing Playbook vs. Discovery** While established playbooks (e.g., for hackathons or marketing) offer practical advice, an engaged founder is crucial for understanding how to adapt these playbooks to their specific vision and users [00:41:40]. Relying solely on external consultants without founder engagement can lead to disaster [00:42:50].
*   **Product is Never Finished** A product is an ongoing endeavor [00:54:50]. Even with good traction, work should continue to improve the product and expand its reach to new audiences [00:59:13].
*   **Talking to Users and Non-Users** To improve a product, it's essential to talk to both frequent users and those who don't use it, understanding their reasons, preferences, and backgrounds [00:55:58].
*   **Using Your Own Product** A key first step in product development is for the founder to use their own product regularly [00:56:52]. This helps to master the product and understand what might be best for an initial user base [00:57:05].
*   **Taking Risks and Bets** Taking risks and making bets based on gut feelings about potential improvements or interesting new features is a healthy practice [00:59:45]. It helps to understand user reactions and calibrate the building process [01:00:08].
*   **UX-First Approach** Building from a user experience (UX) perspective downwards, rather than infrastructure upwards, can help bridge the gap between complex on-chain infrastructure and broader user adoption [01:09:20].
*   **Bootstrapping vs. Raising Capital** Bootstrapping (not raising outside institutional VC rounds) can provide founders with more leverage, avoiding the "VC hamster wheel" of constant fundraising pressure [01:31:05]. However, the need for capital depends heavily on the business model; capital-intensive businesses like marketplaces may require significant funding [01:31:54]. There can be a bias towards raising too much money in crypto, leading to a lack of discipline [01:32:56].
*   **Execution Over Strategy** While strategy is important, good execution is often more critical for success, particularly in fields like media where competitors can be outmaneuvered through better implementation [01:29:55].
*   **Betting on Yourself Earlier** Founders might regret not betting on themselves earlier, especially in areas like content creation or core product development, instead of relying on outsourced models that prevent full ownership [01:35:50].
*   **Questioning Assumptions** In the chaotic, information-imperfect environment of a startup, it's crucial to constantly question assumptions and revisit problems from first principles [01:24:40]. This "psychologically effortful" process can unlock significant growth by revealing missed opportunities [01:25:41].
*   **Shipping Fast and Taking Shortcuts** Experience in startups teaches the importance of shipping fast and taking shortcuts to get products out quickly, as larger companies often have infrastructure and "nice-to-haves" that startups cannot afford [02:04:20].
*   **Selling the Product** Even engineers who prefer building must be willing to "sell the product" [02:06:44]. This involves significant outreach, hopping on calls, and building trust with users and partners, even when building "trustless systems" [02:06:57].

### Crypto-Specific Challenges

*   **Skepticism and Loneliness** Being an entrepreneur in crypto is often lonely due to inherent skepticism about anything new [02:59:54]. Founders face daily skepticism, rejection in fundraising, and employees joining and leaving [00:29:27].
*   **Explaining and Educating** Crypto founders have to explain and educate more than those in traditional industries, as the technology is often misunderstood and associated with negative perceptions [01:33:00].
*   **Community Dogma** While seemingly open, the Ethereum community, like others, can have strong "dogma" or "the correct way to be open," which can be challenging for those attempting to "break the meta" or introduce different approaches [01:18:28].
*   **Regulatory/Legal Navigation** The evolving nature of the industry means founders must spend significant unexpected time navigating legal and regulatory challenges [02:07:25].

### Personal Qualities

*   **Deep Personal Conviction** Founders must possess deep personal conviction about what they are doing to withstand the daily skepticism and rejections [00:30:40].
*   **Resilience to Turnover** It's important to be "steely eyed" about people coming and going, realizing that an organization, once built, "outlasts anyone" and ultimately, the founders themselves [00:32:06].
*   **Prioritizing Mental Health** Building a startup is a "marathon not a sprint," requiring founders to prioritize their own mental health and invest in themselves to sustain the long-term effort [01:36:10]. "You just have to survive" [01:37:30].
*   **Grasping the Gravity of the Moment** The opportunity to build anti-authoritarian technology and economies that reflect desired values in an era of decaying industrial institutions can be a powerful motivator [01:56:59].

## Unexpected Time Investments

Founders often find themselves dedicating time to activities they didn't anticipate at the outset:

*   **Social Media Engagement** Leaders of crypto projects may spend an unexpectedly large amount of time on social media platforms like Twitter and Farcaster to directly engage with and recognize their community and foster a sense of belonging [01:29:29].
*   **Talking to External Stakeholders** This includes engaging with governmental agencies and institutions that are exploring the space but not yet active [01:04:20]. This participation helps to contribute to broader discussions and potentially secure future adoption [01:04:47].
*   **Interpersonal Team Dynamics** Managing internal team conflicts, ensuring harmony, and resolving interpersonal issues becomes a significant part of a founder's role, especially as teams grow beyond a certain size [01:22:19].
*   **People Management and Leveling** A surprising amount of time is spent on talent development, including promotions, compensation frameworks, communication flows between teams, and managing power dynamics [01:38:51].
*   **Context Switching** As teams grow, founders experience a significant amount of context switching, jumping between various tasks, which consumes a substantial amount of time [02:08:25].

## Final Advice for Aspiring Founders

*   **Keep Building and Stay "Based"**: This means working hard, staying optimistic about the future, pushing boundaries with creativity, and prioritizing the team and community over individual interests [01:54:57].
*   **Start with Mission, Iterate** Begin by defining a clear mission and allow its articulation to evolve over time [01:46:26]. This mission acts as a "North Star" that guides the organization through different product iterations [01:48:58].
*   **Build a Movement, Not Just a Company** Focus on stimulating a broader movement around the mission rather than just building a single company. This involves collaborating with others in the ecosystem who share similar goals [01:50:33].
*   **Build Modular Protocols, Not Monoliths** Emulate the Unix philosophy by building small, modular pieces of software or protocols that do one thing well and are interoperable with others [01:51:57]. This approach allows for faster development and creates exponentially more value through compounding contributions [01:53:10].
*   **Find Product/Protocol Market Fit** The journey of a founder often involves starting multiple projects, failing, learning, and iterating until finding something that deeply resonates with the community [01:54:19]. This iterative process means going "broad and then deep, and then broad and then deep" until finding that resonant fit [01:55:27].
*   **Take Risks and Start Small** The best risk is simply starting to build [01:05:14]. Begin with a side project that could evolve into something bigger, or just start building, get feedback, and calibrate your approach [01:05:23].
*   **Don't Fear the Pain** Entrepreneurship is a painful yet worthwhile experience [00:35:38]. The world is moved by people with the energy to push things forward [00:50:50].

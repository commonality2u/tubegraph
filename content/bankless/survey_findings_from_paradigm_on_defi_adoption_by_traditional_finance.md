A survey conducted by the Paradigm policy team investigated the current engagement level of traditional finance (TradFi) institutions with internet money and finance, specifically focusing on DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The findings, derived from polling 300 TradFi professionals, revealed a surprising percentage of companies that consider DeFi to be critically important for their future business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Survey Motivation and Methodology

For several years, discussions about DeFi have occurred within traditional finance circles, often behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, policymakers in Washington D.C. frequently question the extent of real interest from traditional financiers, sometimes dismissing DeFi as merely a "toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. To address this, Paradigm partnered with Ali Labs to survey 300 TradFi professionals globally, spanning various institutions, roles, and regions, including banks, buy-side firms, asset managers, retail banks, credit unions, corporate banks, investment banks, payments companies, venture capitalists, private equity firms, and financial market infrastructure providers like exchanges and DTCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The survey aimed to understand:
*   Their current engagement level with crypto (researching or actively involved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   How they are getting involved, such as through [[tokenization_and_its_role_in_bridging_traditional_and_decentralized_finance | tokenization]], stablecoins, or leveraging DeFi infrastructure like DEXes and borrowing/lending applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Their motivations, including cutting costs, reducing settlement times, and increasing transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Their general thoughts on DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Engagement was categorized into "not engaged," "researching or exploring" (conducting analyses, strategic planning), and various forms of "active involvement" (building/launching products, pilot programs, investing in crypto/DeFi firms, or joining consortiums) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Key Findings on DeFi Engagement

The survey's verdict was unanimous: there is a surprisingly high amount of interest in crypto, and in DeFi in particular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   Two-thirds of TradFi firms are actively either experimenting with or researching DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   While 30% reported merely researching or exploring, a significant 66% indicated "total engagement" with DeFi, meaning they are doing something more than just researching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This engagement encompasses activities like building products, pilot programs, and direct investments in crypto firms or DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

One encouraging aspect of the findings is that the areas TradFi firms are engaging with align with what "crypto-native DeFi people" would expect and be excited about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Motivations and Perceived Benefits

The primary motivations for TradFi's interest in crypto and DeFi are:
*   **Faster settlement times** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Increased transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Lower transaction costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

These benefits are directly linked to the core advantages of [[blockchain_vs_traditional_financial_systems | blockchain technology]] over traditional financial systems, which are often "insanely inefficient and manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Automation through smart contracts can reduce manual labor, increase efficiency, cut costs, and decrease compliance burdens compared to traditional, human-intensive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

For example, blockchain transaction fees are significantly lower than traditional wire transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

### Areas of Interest in DeFi

When asked about specific parts of DeFi that interest them most, TradFi professionals highlighted:
*   [[tokenization_and_its_role_in_bridging_traditional_and_decentralized_finance | Tokenization]] of assets (stocks, bonds, derivatives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   Stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While stablecoins are very important and have seen the most traction, TradFi is even more excited about [[tokenization_and_its_role_in_bridging_traditional_and_decentralized_finance | tokenizing other assets]] to achieve similar benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The interest in DEXes is very close to that of tokenization, suggesting TradFi views DeFi as more than just a tokenization machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   Prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   Interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

This indicates that traditional finance is open to the "whole panoply of what DeFi can offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape: From "Tokenize the World" to Reality

The long-standing "tokenize the world" narrative in crypto, previously seen as a meme or a distant dream, is now feeling different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. The reason for this shift is multifaceted:
*   **Maturity of Infrastructure**: The underlying blockchain infrastructure has advanced significantly, making very cheap transactions realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Alignment**: The alignment of institutional interest with retail crypto interest, coupled with progress in regulatory clarity from bodies like the SEC, suggests that the stars are aligning for real-world [[tokenization_and_its_role_in_bridging_traditional_and_decentralized_finance | tokenization]] and on-chain trading of equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   **Internal Momentum**: Enough people have been in crypto and enough has been built to demonstrate a clear path forward, even within large institutions. They now see blockchain involvement as valuable and even a path to dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### DeFi's Definition and Interaction with DEXes

For the purpose of the survey, "DeFi" was deliberately left vague, as it is seen as a "concept as much as it is a specific use case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. At its core, DeFi represents the idea of [[permissionless_finance_in_defi_vs_traditional_finance | permissionless peer-to-peer engagement]] and networks, something without a true analog in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. TradFi's appeal is not limited to a single protocol; rather, they find the broader concept appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

Regarding DEXes, institutions are becoming comfortable with on-chain trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. However, direct "aping" into public DEXes with anonymized counterparties is unlikely initially due to compliance needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Instead, a hybrid approach is expected, possibly involving:
*   **Verified Pools**: Platforms like Coinbase's verified pools leverage Uniswap V4 hooks to ensure only verified actors participate, addressing regulatory or market structure concerns (e.g., avoiding informed traders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Interoperability**: Despite potential specialized DEXes for institutions, the inherent interoperability of DeFi means liquidity can flow efficiently between different pools, benefiting the entire ecosystem through atomic transactions and efficient arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### Rejection of Private Blockchains

TradFi is formally rejecting the notion that private blockchains are as valuable as public, [[permissionless_finance_in_defi_vs_traditional_finance | permissionless blockchains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. While private consortiums (e.g., a blockchain between five banks) may not be entirely irrelevant, it's becoming clear that connectivity to public blockchains and their inherent liquidity and network effects is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

The rise of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, such as those on [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem | Ethereum]], has been a key enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. L2s offer scale, reduced latency, and customizability (e.g., for KYC-only users), allowing for a permissioned vision to be realized *on top of* decentralized L1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. This allows institutions to have control over their specific layer while benefiting from the backbone of an L1 ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## Regulatory Bottlenecks and Future Outlook

While institutions are "chomping at the bit" to engage with DeFi, the primary bottleneck remains [[barriers_to_institutional_entry_into_defi | regulatory clarity and compliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. Although the SEC is making progress and legislative action is underway for areas like stablecoins, the main challenge is allowing existing *regulated entities* (banks, hedge funds, credit card companies) to access DeFi itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This requires action not just from the SEC, but also from other regulators like the FDIC, OCC, and the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Currently, these regulators are primarily allowing access to CeFi (centralized finance), not yet explicitly to DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The absence of a clear regulatory model for DeFi (unlike CeFi, which has analogs in traditional finance) makes it harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. The prevailing principle for DeFi regulation is "do no harm," but a way must be found for existing firms to access and understand the space through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

TradFi expects the impact of DeFi on their core business to be minimal in the short term (1-5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, but sentiment shifts significantly over longer horizons. They increasingly view DeFi as inevitable, with 28% of respondents believing it will be "critically important" to their business within 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. This indicates a profound long-term shift in how their businesses will operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

The key attraction for TradFi to public blockchains is not decentralization or credible neutrality, but rather "bigness"—the size and economic activity of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem | Ethereum]] has been attractive due to its large economy, and [[role_of_ethereum_and_other_chains_in_defi_ecosystem | Solana]] is gaining interest due to recent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

## Implications for Builders

For aspiring builders, the report underscores the immense opportunity in developing solutions for when traditional assets come on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Specifically, there is significant interest in decentralized lending and borrowing protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. Existing protocols, often not designed for an influx of an arbitrarily large number of diverse assets or governed by DAOs, may need to evolve to handle this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

In conclusion, the survey highlights that DeFi is a "killer app" in crypto, in high demand from some of the most powerful financial firms in the world. They recognize its value and are preparing for its inevitable and critical role in their future business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

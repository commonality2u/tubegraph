The year 2025 has begun, with a focus on market performance and predictions for the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Bitcoin Market Overview

Bitcoin saw a relatively flat week, starting at $95,500 and ending at $96,000, indicating a slight upward bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Bitwise has filed for a Bitcoin Standard Corporate ETF, which aims to incentivize stocks of companies that have adopted the Bitcoin standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. To be included in this ETF, a company must hold 1,000 Bitcoin or more on its corporate treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Currently, this club would include about 22 companies, with MicroStrategy leading significantly with 444,000 Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Other notable companies that hold Bitcoin on their treasury include Coinbase and Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## [[Ethereum price surge and crypto market trends | Ethereum Market Overview]]

[[Bitcoin and Ether Market Movements and Projections | Ether]] showed slightly more bullish movement than Bitcoin this week, starting at $3,333 and increasing by 3.8% to $3,450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This comes after a period where Ether dipped below $4,000, and it is currently at the lower end of the $3,000 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

[[Market Trends in Crypto and Ethereum | Ethereum ETFs]] have shown significant activity, with December being a strong month for inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. On December 31st alone, [[Bitcoin and Ether Market Movements and Projections | Ether ETFs]] saw $36 million in net inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Overall, [[Ethereum price surge and crypto market trends | Ether ETFs]] accumulated $2.6 billion in total net inflows for December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This positive momentum is a reversal from negative flows experienced for most of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The [[Ethereums competitive position against Bitcoin | ETH/BTC ratio]] remains in "no man's land" at 0.055, higher than recent lows but not yet surpassing recent highs, offering no clear signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Broader Crypto Market Trends

The total crypto market cap currently stands at $3.57 trillion, aiming for the $4 trillion mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

The crypto AI sector has been particularly active, with many tokens like AI 16z (up 150% on the week, with a $2.2 billion market cap) and Virtuals (up 60% with a $4.6 billion market cap) seeing substantial gains since before Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. AI 16z is associated with the Eliza framework, while Virtuals is known for its AI agent Launchpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. AI mind share now accounts for nearly 60% of all narratives, significantly dwarfing memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) monthly trading volumes reached an all-time high of over $462 billion in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Leading DEXs for December included Uniswap ($106 billion), PancakeSwap ($96 billion), and Radium ($58 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. It is predicted that the rise of AI agents, being "bankless by default," will provide tailwinds for DEX volumes and on-chain TVL, as they will primarily interact with decentralized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## 2025 Market Predictions

Curated predictions for 2025 include:
*   The SPX (S&P 500 index) is predicted to reach 7,500, driven by AI delivering on its promises in traditional fintech equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This suggests a bullish year for stocks, primarily led by "Mag 7" (AI) stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   The [[Bitcoin and stablecoin market trends | stablecoin market cap]] is expected to hit $500 billion, a significant increase from its current $210 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This prediction is coupled with the possibility of companies like Stripe or Robinhood launching their own stablecoins, and Walmart or Amazon beginning to accept stablecoins for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   Coinbase predicts that the next administration's projected deficit spending will lead to greater risk-taking and increased crypto buying as more dollars circulate in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   The US is expected to re-emerge as the dominant global hub for crypto, with founders returning and US conferences surpassing their Asian counterparts in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
*   Galaxy Digital predicts that five NASDAQ 100 companies and five nation-states will announce adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   Delphi Digital predicts that crypto will split into two major verticals: "web3 natives" (high-risk traders involved with memecoins, AI agents, pre-sales) and "regular investors" (institutional and retail investors with more fundamental strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Early-stage DeFi, real-world assets, and De-pin protocols not securing leading positions may be sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Agent-driven transactions are projected to make up 10% of all on-chain transactions by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   An AI agent platform is predicted to enter the top 10 crypto by market cap, which currently requires a market cap of over $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Virtuals, currently at $4.4 billion, is a candidate for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   A personal prediction for Ether is a base case of $10,000, with a bullish scenario reaching between $15,000 and $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This is based on factors like blob space heating up, the AI meta, and Layer 2s, in addition to potential institutional buyers and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
*   A consensus prediction from Bankless is that crypto AI agents will dominate the 2025 meta and hit a $250 billion market cap, up from the current $17.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.

## Ethereum Upgrades and Development

The Ethereum roadmap for 2025, specifically the Petra upgrade (expected this year), includes several key EIPs:
*   **Max EB (Max Effective Balance)**: This allows Ethereum validators to hold and stake more than 32 Ether, consolidating multiple validators into one and reducing messaging overhead, which improves Layer 1 scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Account Abstraction for EOA wallets**: This enables externally owned accounts (EOAs) to function like account-abstracted wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Blob throughput increase**: Blob capacity will double from an average of three to an average of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   Notably, Data Availability Sampling (P-EAS), a massive 10x upgrade to blob space, is not included in Petra and is now expected in a later hard fork, Fusaka, likely in late 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. This means the immediate increase in blob space will only be the doubling in Petra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy

MicroStrategy plans to accelerate its 2021 Bitcoin acquisition plan, which involves investing $42 billion through debt instruments and equity to expand its Bitcoin holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. Shareholders will vote on speeding up these capital-raising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

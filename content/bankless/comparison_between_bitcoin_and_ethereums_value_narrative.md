From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The establishment of an asset's value, particularly as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]], is presented as stemming from "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This concept is likened to gold, which is described as embodying "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and Bitcoin, which is characterized as "pure irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Narrative Approach

Bitcoin's success in establishing its value narrative is attributed to its strong "meme layer narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and a degree of "Bitcoin toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach, while not requiring the same level of toxicity from Ethereum, highlights the effectiveness of a focused and fervent community in building confidence around an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Proposed Narrative for Ethereum

To cultivate [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] as a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]], a prescriptive strategy is outlined, emphasizing the importance of community action and narrative shaping. The speaker suggests that the Ethereum community, sometimes perceived as too intellectual or "ivory tower," may not fully appreciate the "meme layer narrative" necessary for creating a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The recommended actions include:
*   Encouraging holding [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] and promoting this to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Shaming entities like L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, while celebrating those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Promoting staking, restaking, and auto-staking of [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Memeing [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Utilizing various forms of media (writing, tweeting, podcasting, ship-posting) and electing leaders who support this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Proselytizing the idea that "1 [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] equals 1 [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]]" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Community Engagement and Mindset

The speaker acknowledges that some in the Ethereum community might be resistant to tactics like "shaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, the argument is made that winning requires a "contingent of [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | ETH]] bulls" who are intensely enthusiastic about [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] to the point of "veer[ing] on laser eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This does not necessarily require the same level of "Bitcoin toxicity" but demands "faith in [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | ETH]] the asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is crucial for the [[cultural_differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Ethereum community]] to reorient its discussions towards the asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

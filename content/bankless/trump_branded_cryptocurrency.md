Donald Trump has branded his own [[introduction_of_trump_meme_coin | cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The value of this coin experienced a significant surge following an announcement that top holders would be invited to a dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Value and Market Cap

This [[value_surge_of_trumps_cryptocurrency | value surge]] occurred prior to his inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Discussions around the cryptocurrency often involve its market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. There was a notable moment where a reporter appeared to struggle with the concept of market cap when interviewing Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The [[trump_and_crypto_market_cap_comments | Trump coin]] has a fully diluted valuation of $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The interviewer seemed to be attempting to get Trump to state this multi-billion dollar valuation publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Trump's Stance and Origins
Trump has stated he is in favor of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and believes it is important, noting that if the US does not engage with it, China will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

He clarified that he initiated this cryptocurrency "long before the election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Concerns have been raised about whether he is profiting from the presidency through this venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, to which Trump responded, "I'm not profiting from anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

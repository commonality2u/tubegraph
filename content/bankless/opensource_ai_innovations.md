The field of AI has seen significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of [[Open Source AI Models | open-source AI models]] and their impact on the broader AI and crypto ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Deep Seek: A Game-Changer in Open Source AI

A significant recent development is the rise of Deep Seek, an [[Open Source AI Models | open-source AI model]] developed by a team in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This model has garnered attention because it cost significantly less to train compared to models from [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]] and can match or even outperform [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]]'s top models in benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Key Innovations of Deep Seek
Deep Seek pioneered two groundbreaking research techniques that caught other developers, who had invested billions, off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:

1.  **Efficient Data Usage**: Deep Seek found a more effective way to use data for training its model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Traditionally, training models required vast amounts of data combined with extensive compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Given China's compute constraints due to chip bans, Deep Seek optimized its training process by feeding the model a bit of compute, letting it produce an output, and then having the model review that output to learn and improve more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This method means the model takes fewer steps and uses less compute and data to understand what it needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. It addresses the issue of hallucinations in early large language models (LLMs) by breaking the process into chunks, reviewing each chunk for coherence before generating a final answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. While this chunk-by-chunk review might require more inference time, inference is generally cheaper than full training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
2.  **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Unlike traditional GPT models that query the entire model ("brain") and stimulate every neuron for a request, Deep Seek routes requests only to the necessary sections of the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This "mixture of experts" approach allows the model to activate only a few relevant experts out of many, saving up to 97% of the energy while producing 97% of the quality of a full model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Performance and Cost Efficiency
Deep Seek R1 is measured to be 45 times more efficient than its United States-based competitors, meaning it uses 45 times less compute resources to get the same response in about the same amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Its API calls are also priced 95% less than [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> [!info] Deep Seek vs. OpenAI
> Deep Seek R1 ranks very close to [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]]'s 01 in overall quality, is comparable in speed, and is significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Market Impact and Geopolitics
The emergence of Deep Seek caused a stir in the market, with some attributing a market dip to its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This development highlights an ongoing "arms race" between the United States and China in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Jevons Paradox and Compute Demand
The increased efficiency demonstrated by Deep Seek brings up Jevons Paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This paradox states that as technological advancements improve the efficiency of a resource, its overall consumption can paradoxically increase because lower costs expand potential use cases, driving greater demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. In the context of AI, as compute becomes cheaper due to innovations like Deep Seek, [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | AI adoption]] will spread faster, leading to greater global demand for GPUs, energy, and data infrastructure, rather than reducing overall compute consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

### China's Strategic Open Sourcing
China's decision to [[Open Source AI Models | open-source Deep Seek]] is seen as a strategic move to potentially undermine US-based AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. By providing a high-performing, low-cost [[Open Source AI Models | open-source model]], China aims to commoditize some of the value created by US tech, slow down investment in American AI companies, and bolster its own AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This is perceived as a "splash of very cold water" on America's AI darlings, forcing them to re-evaluate their strategies and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

## Implications for Open Source AI Development

> [!tip] The "Open Source Wins" Thesis
> The convergence of [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | AI innovation]] on [[Open Source AI Development | open source]] means that even if private companies like [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]] or Meta build advanced AI, the core technology eventually becomes accessible in the [[Open Source AI Development | open-source world]], often reflected in tokens on open blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. While proprietary models offer early access, the long-term value often accrues to [[Open Source AI Development | open-source alternatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

The developments with Deep Seek are massively bullish for the consumer and the AI sector at large, making AI more useful, efficient, and enabling faster product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The fact that Deep Seek is [[Open Source AI Models | open-source]] means that its breakthroughs are accessible to everyone, promoting wider [[Open Source AI Development | open-source AI development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

### AI Agents and Open Source Convergence
The same week Deep Seek made headlines, [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]] and Perplexity announced their agent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. While [[OpenAI updates and their effects | OpenAI]] remains closed-source, their developments confirm that the [[Open Source AI Development | crypto AI agent sector]] is on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Key figures like Jack Dorsey are also releasing their own [[Open Source AI Development | open-source agent systems]] (e.g., "Goose") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

Many crypto protocols and frameworks have quickly integrated Deep Seek into their systems, allowing agents built on their rails to benefit from its efficiency and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This rapid adoption demonstrates crypto's resilience and ability to adapt beneficial [[AI innovation and emerging technologies | AI innovations]] for its own ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

Berachain, a new Layer 1 blockchain, stands out due to its distinctive and unconventional approach to community formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Unlike many blockchain projects that originate from a technical breakthrough, Berachain's journey began with a community-first, meme-driven strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Origins as an NFT Project

The project didn't initially start as a blockchain. Instead, it began as a collection of 100 NFTs called "The Bong Bears," featuring bears with bongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This playful and somewhat "cursed" origin set the tone for its unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The founders, Smokey the Bara and Papa, had been active in the crypto space for nearly a decade, participating in DeFi summer and the rise of NFTs in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The Bong Bears NFTs were designed to "multiply" or "rebase," reducing scarcity and price over time, which allowed more people to enter the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Mimetic Positioning and Evolution

The "mimetic" positioning of Berachain was largely a "happy accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The name "Beas" (instead of bears) originated from a community member in their Discord, and it simply "stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This organic evolution of its identity from within the community contrasts with externally forced narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

The project embraces a "friendly fire humor" approach, even leaning into FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) and self-deprecating jokes, which helps to disarm critics and make the community more entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Community-First Model

Berachain's community formation flipped the typical blockchain project model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Traditional Model vs. Berachain's Model
*   **Traditional**: A few founders, often highly technical, develop a zero-to-one innovation. This technical breakthrough is then broadcasted, attracting a community of "nerd-sniped" individuals who form around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Berachain**: The community was formed first, initially around the NFTs and various factors. This community fostered a unique flavor and generated intellectual and social capital. The collective insights of this community, alongside the co-founders, then led to the development of technical innovations like [[berachain_overview_and_introduction | Proof of Liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:58]</a>.

This community-first approach meant that developers received input from the community and application builders throughout the development process, which was incredibly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Role of Community in Innovation

From conversations within the DeFi-native Discord communities, members put forward numerous ideas and engaged in productive discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:49]</a>. This intellectual capital contributed to the development of Berachain's core innovation: [[berachain_overview_and_introduction | Proof of Liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:50]</a>. The goal was to align liquidity and security at the protocol level, a concept that emerged from community needs and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Airdrop

Berachain launched its mainnet in February 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. Despite criticisms about it being a "VC chain," the team asserts that the project has always been community-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:31]</a>.

To ensure community benefit, Berachain implemented a "request for proposal" (RFP) program for its token generation event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:36]</a>. This program allowed applications and community groups to propose plans for how they would use airdrop proceeds to drive ecosystem growth and user adoption on mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:59]</a>. As a result, the majority of the airdrop was directed to community members and those who helped build the project from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:08]</a>. This dedication highlights the ongoing commitment to the community that fostered the project's development.

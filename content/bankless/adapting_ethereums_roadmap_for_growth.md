The [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum ecosystem]] is undergoing a significant strategic pivot, driven by a recognition of past challenges and a renewed focus on growth and product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. This reorientation aims to restore [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] to a state of growth and unleash long-term upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

## Identifying the Problem
For almost three years, the ETH price has lagged the market, and other ecosystems have captured marginal industry growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. The core issues plaguing [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] have been widely discussed, with various perspectives:

*   **Lagging Growth and Activity** Activity on [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] is down, with less app building and fewer users. It is no longer the obvious default platform for building in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Marginal growth is now found on non-[[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Base and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. The declining ETH price reflects this lack of growth on the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Ethereum L1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Mentality** The Ethereum Foundation (EF) and the broader [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] community have been accused of being an "ivory tower," focusing on very high-brow research without actively listening to app builders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This has led to not always building the right product for its diverse user base, including L2s, app builders, and end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
*   **Neglect of the L1** There was a perceived rejection of L1 growth, with the mindset that scaling was only needed years down the road, and the L1 was not seen as the primary product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Downstream Consequences of Decentralization** While decentralization is a core value, it led to a lack of clear responsibility for ensuring the entire [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]] ecosystem made sense as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. The EF saw its role more as a public goods funder rather than a leader of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Shift in Meta** The crypto landscape has shifted from a research-dominated era (2014-2017) to one where product focus is paramount (around 2021 onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. [[Ethereums strategic pivot and scaling layer 1 efforts | Ethereum]]'s previous culture, focused on long-term technical solutions, became a disadvantage when competitors like Solana excelled on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Adapting the [[Ethereum roadmap]]

### Scaling the L1
A major focus of the adapted [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum roadmap]] is to aggressively scale the L1. The past mistake of making the L1 expensive and difficult to use is being reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

*   **Increased Gas Limit:** The goal is a significant increase in the gas limit. Currently, the gas limit is around 36 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.
    *   **Short-term:** Without any technical changes, just using available headroom, the gas limit is expected to double to 72 million by fall and potentially reach 100 million by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Medium-term (Glamsterdam Hard Fork):** The Glamsterdam hard fork (first half of next year) will introduce features like delayed execution, block-level access lists, and 4444 gas pricing changes, enabling a gas limit of 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Long-term (2-3 years out):** ZK-based scaling will allow for even more aggressive scaling, potentially 100x or 1000x, while maintaining lightweight verification for nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This involves using ZK proofs to put the L1 into blobs, making it technically operate like a rollup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Block Times:** While scaling block size is immediate, reducing block times is also a priority for improved DeFi product features and lower MEV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
    *   The aim is to reduce slot times, with 6 seconds seen as a realistic medium-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Eventually, the goal is to get below 4 seconds, and even 1 second is not considered completely unrealistic in the very long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
    *   Optimistic pre-confirmations are crucial for immediate user experience (UX), providing 100-millisecond roundtrip confirmations for actions, similar to how L2 sequencers provide great UX today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### The Role of L2s
The [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | rollup-centric roadmap]] is not seen as a mistake, but rather the L1 was neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The benefit of L2s includes:

*   **Generic Spillover Space:** L2s provide transparent, generic spillover space for the L1, which cannot handle all demand immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Seamless Interoperability:** A short-term goal is to ensure seamless interoperability between L1 and L2s, with standards for assets flowing between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Transparent User Experience:** The long-term vision is for L2s to become so transparent that users don't even notice if they are on L1 or L2, experiencing one large, infinite compute space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Special Purpose L2s:** There will always be room for specialized L2s, for specific applications like gaming, which may offer a meaningfully different experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining L1 Economic Importance:** To prevent L2s from choosing other data availability layers like Celestia, the L1 must remain economically important, with strong liquidity and DeFi activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Closer Integration:** The L1 will offer native interoperability solutions for L2s, creating a closer symbiotic relationship. This includes L2 models like "based rollups" and "native rollups" that are more tightly integrated and eliminate certain security model slices, making them "truly Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Changes at the Ethereum Foundation (EF)
The EF is undergoing a significant internal transformation to align with the new strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

*   **Shift in Role:** The EF is moving from solely being a public goods funder to taking on more responsibility for guiding [[Ethereum Roadmap and Future Upgrades | Ethereum]] holistically, focusing on product experience and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.
*   **New Leadership:** The appointment of Tomas and Shawe as co-CEOs signals a change in the executive director role, making it more akin to a CEO position that unifies individual projects and teams into a cohesive shared strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Communication and Product Focus:** There has been a massive upgrade in internal and external communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. The EF is actively listening to the community and bringing in product-focused voices, moving away from a purely academic research mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:58">[01:24:58]</a>.
*   **Commitment to Action:** The new leadership is focused on action and execution rather than just theoretical discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>.

While the "turning of the ship" is a slow process for a large, decentralized ecosystem like [[Ethereums roadmap and potential upside | Ethereum]], there is newfound optimism. The focus is on tangible, short-to-medium-term actions to restore growth and unleash future technical upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. The community is increasingly open to a product mindset, and there is a clear direction for productive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

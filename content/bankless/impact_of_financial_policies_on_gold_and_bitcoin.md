The global financial system has undergone several significant phase changes since World War II, each with profound implications for monetary policy and asset valuations, particularly for [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold]] and [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The current period suggests a shift towards a new monetary structure characterized by financial repression and national capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

## Historical Monetary Structures

### Bretton Woods (1944)
After World War II, the United States and its allies established the Bretton Woods system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This system involved other countries pegging their currencies to the US dollar, which in turn was pegged to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The US government promised central banks they could exchange dollars for gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This arrangement allowed the US to finance the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, enabling those nations to export their way to prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Petrodollar Era (1971)
The Bretton Woods system worked until the 1970s when the US began running large deficits due to programs like LBJ's Great Society and the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Foreign countries, notably France, started demanding their gold back in exchange for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In 1971, President Nixon announced that the dollar would no longer be linked to gold and would instead float freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This marked the beginning of the petrodollar era, where the dollar's value was informally linked to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A deal with Saudi Arabia ensured that oil would be sold in dollars, and the resulting dollar earnings would be invested in US banks and treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This system was enforced by US military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Petroyuan Era (1994)
By 1994, China entered the global economic scene as a manufacturing powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. China and other "Asian tigers" adopted a mercantilist policy: undervaluing their currencies to boost exports and accumulating US treasuries to ensure access to dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This era led to the de-industrialization and financialization of the US economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, with manufacturing jobs moving to Asia and corporate profits increasing through debt-financed stock buybacks rather than new factory construction in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. This process contributed to a widening wealth gap in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## The New Monetary Structure

### Shifting Reserve Assets
The current administration's perspective suggests that the post-1971 reliance on US Treasury bonds as the global reserve asset has led to negative social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. There is an implicit desire to move away from US Treasuries as the primary global reserve asset, hinting instead at [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold]] or [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]] filling that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The distinction is made between a "reserve currency" (the dollar for trade) and a "reserve asset" (what foreign countries do with those dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Tariffs vs. Capital Controls
Attempts to rectify trade imbalances through tariffs have proven politically destabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. Tariffs lead to higher goods prices without immediately bringing back high-paying jobs, making consumers feel poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This political unsustainability led to a "90-day truce" on escalating tariffs between the US and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

Instead, the focus is expected to shift to [[role_of_fiscal_dominance_and_government_policies_in_crypto_markets | capital controls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. These controls aim to curb foreign ownership of US financial assets and can take various forms, such as:
*   **User fees/taxes on foreign-held assets**: A potential 2% yearly tax on foreign-owned US assets (stocks, bonds, property) could generate significant revenue, potentially allowing the elimination of income taxes for most Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This is seen as a politically palatable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Forced bond purchases**: Domestically, institutions like pension funds could be mandated to allocate a percentage of their portfolios to government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.
*   **Restrictions on foreign ownership**: Examples already exist, such as Texas banning certain foreign nationals from owning land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. This reflects a "America for Americans or allies" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

### [[fiscal_deficits_dollar_devaluation_and_bitcoin | Capital Flight and Money Printing]]
The imposition of [[role_of_fiscal_dominance_and_government_policies_in_crypto_markets | capital controls]] will likely lead to capital flight from US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This would cause a decline in the value of US stocks, bonds, and the dollar, while simultaneously driving up the price of [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold]] and [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The ultimate consequence of capital controls is that the Treasury, the Fed, and politicians must all do their part to create policies to provide dollars to replace the foreigners who are leaving, and they're just going to print them. And the consequence will be [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold]] and [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]] go through the moon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

This money printing, or quantitative easing (QE), is seen as inevitable because politicians will not campaign on austerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. The Fed will act to fund the US government, prioritizing the preservation of the empire over the dollar's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. While QE might be rebranded to avoid negative public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>, it is expected to commence by mid-2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

### Impact on Assets
*   **US Treasuries**: Their role as a global reserve asset is expected to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Foreign countries are already reducing their proportionate ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. Long-dated bonds are particularly unattractive investments due to rising rates and continuous refinancing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Gold]]**: Seen as a neutral reserve asset that human civilization and central banks understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The US Treasury might even revalue its gold reserves from $42 per ounce to market price, potentially generating trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>. This would be politically expedient to fund projects and reduce bond yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]] and [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | Cryptocurrencies]]**: Positioned as ideal assets for preserving capital and maintaining access to spending power amidst global financial uncertainty and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. While institutional readiness for [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | crypto]] as a primary reserve asset is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>, money printing will benefit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. The market may experience corrections as people understand [[impact_of_macro_environment_on_crypto_markets | macroeconomics]] and the implications of bond market dysfunction for [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | crypto markets response to federal economic policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE] In this environment, the overall "trade" is to avoid bonds and instead invest in assets that appreciate with increased fiat liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. This includes [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | Bitcoin]], [[role_of_bitcoin_and_gold_in_capital_flight_scenarios | gold]], and even broad stock market indices like the NASDAQ or S&P 500, which are expected to go up in nominal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

## Political Landscape and [[the_relationship_between_trumps_policies_and_bitcoins_growth | Crypto Policy]]

The current political climate, particularly under a potential Trump administration, suggests a more favorable stance towards [[the_relationship_between_trumps_policies_and_bitcoins_growth | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. However, this support is seen through a lens of political expediency and benefits for large, centralized crypto companies (e.g., Coinbase, BlackRock) seeking regulatory moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. True "America as the crypto capital of the world" would involve permissionless innovation with minimal rules, similar to the early internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

### Global Liquidity
[[impact_of_macro_environment_on_crypto_markets | Global liquidity]] is the primary driver for [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | crypto]] value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. Bitcoin's value is seen as technology plus liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. Key indicators for US liquidity include excess reserves at the Fed and other deposits/liabilities from the banking system, which proxy bank lending and Fed-created deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. Treasury buybacks are also considered liquidity positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Central bank and government policy responses are highly sensitive to market volatility, particularly the MOVE index (bond volatility index) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. Spikes in this index trigger immediate policy responses, often involving money printing to suppress yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

> [!TIP] The prediction for [[the_impact_of_tariffs_on_bitcoin_and_risk_assets | Bitcoin]] is a run to $150,000-$200,000 in the summer, potentially reaching $250,000 by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. Ethereum is expected to reach $5,000, with a tougher slog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. A future altcoin season is anticipated, but with a focus on projects with real cash flows and clients, rather than just meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>.

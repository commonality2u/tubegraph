The global financial system is currently undergoing a significant shift, moving away from the US Treasury bond as the primary reserve asset [02:26:06]. This change, driven by specific policy choices, is anticipated to have profound [[impact_on_american_markets | impacts on American markets]] and the global economy.

## Historical Context of Monetary Structures

Since World War II, the world has experienced several distinct monetary structures:

*   **Bretton Woods (1944-1971)**: This system, established after World War II, saw other nations pegging their currencies to the US dollar, which in turn was pegged to gold [00:05:54]. The US financed the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, enabling countries like Germany and Japan to export their way to prosperity [00:06:10]. John Maynard Keynes had proposed a customs union with mechanisms and capital controls to rectify trade imbalances, but this was not adopted [00:05:11]. This system ended in 1971 when the US, facing large deficits from programs like LBJ's Great Society and the Vietnam War, could no longer honor gold redemption requests from foreign central banks [00:06:55]. President Nixon then decoupled the dollar from gold, allowing it to float freely [00:07:22].

*   **Petro Dollar (1971-1994)**: Following Bretton Woods, the dollar's backing shifted to oil through an agreement with Saudi Arabia [00:08:33]. The deal ensured that Saudi Arabia, the lowest marginal cost producer of petroleum, would sell oil exclusively in dollars [00:09:05]. In return, the US provided weapons and security to the Saudi royal family. Foreign nations earning these dollars were required to deposit them in US banks and buy US Treasuries [00:08:52]. This cemented the US dollar and Treasuries as the global reserve, backed implicitly by oil and US military power [00:09:29].

*   **Petro Yuan (1994-Present)**: Starting in 1994, China, aiming to become a manufacturing powerhouse, implemented policies to undervalue its currency (the yuan) through a shock devaluation [01:12:48]. This allowed China and other "Asian Tigers" (Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea) to export goods and labor at low costs to the US and Europe [01:12:20]. In exchange for their products, these exporting nations accumulated large amounts of US Treasuries, which they held as a means to access dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil and food [01:13:58]. This system facilitated the de-industrialization and financialization of Western economies, keeping inflation low and increasing corporate profits through cheap labor and goods [01:14:21].

## The Current Monetary Phase Change

The current era, potentially initiated post-COVID or with the re-election of Donald Trump, signifies a new monetary structure [02:02:46]. This shift is marked by a conscious policy choice in the US to move away from Treasuries as the global reserve asset [02:31:31]. The long-standing trade and capital account imbalances created by the Petro Yuan system are no longer considered sustainable [02:01:01].

### Consequences of the Petro Yuan Era on America

The Petro Yuan system, while positioning the US dollar and Treasuries as global exports, had specific [[impact_on_american_markets | impacts on American markets]]:
*   **Trade Deficits and Capital Surpluses**: To maintain its [[global_reserve_currency_status_and_trade_deficits | global reserve currency status]], the US had to run open trade and capital accounts, leading to persistent trade deficits [01:18:36]. Foreigners accumulated dollars by selling goods and invested them in dollar assets, which is a capital account surplus [01:18:43].
*   **Financialization and De-industrialization**: Corporations moved manufacturing bases to Asia for cheaper labor, increasing corporate profits and leading to debt-financed stock buybacks rather than new factory construction in America [01:19:30].
*   **Social Disparity**: This led to a widening wealth gap where stock owners became rich, while the bottom 90% of Americans, often without university degrees, lost high-paying manufacturing jobs, shifting into the gig economy [01:53:07]. This social discontent contributed to political movements like the election of Donald Trump [02:19:57].

## Shifting from Tariffs to Capital Controls

The Trump administration's goal is to rectify these imbalances [02:20:20]. Initially, tariffs were employed to address the trade account deficit, exemplified by "Liberation Day" on April 2nd, which introduced a 10% tariff on all imports, with higher rates for China [02:00:00]. However, tariffs proved to be politically destabilizing, causing goods inflation and failing to immediately bring back high-paying jobs, leading to public dissatisfaction [02:51:30]. This political pressure resulted in a 90-day truce on tariffs with China [02:32:00].

### The Rise of Capital Controls

Given the political unsustainability of tariffs, the shift is expected towards [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]] to address the capital account surplus [03:00:04]. This approach aims to achieve the same rebalancing over a longer period, allowing politicians to remain elected [03:26:06].

>[!INFO] Proposed Forms of Capital Controls
>Influential economists, including Stephen Moore and Michael Pettis, advocate for [[capital_controls_and_the_consequences_for_global_markets | capital controls]]. Potential methods include:
> *   **User Fees/Taxes on Foreign Assets**: A yearly tax (e.g., 2%) on foreign ownership of US stocks, bonds, and real estate, aiming to generate revenue (e.g., $660 billion from $33 trillion in foreign assets) that could eliminate income taxes for 90% of Americans [03:45:00].
> *   **"Century Bonds"**: Forcing allied countries to exchange existing 10-year bonds for 100-year bonds with a significant devaluation, effectively bullying them into taking a loss [03:12:00].
> *   **Banning Foreign Ownership**: Legislation, such as that seen in Texas banning citizens from certain countries (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia) from owning land, serves as a "harbinger" of broader restrictions [03:57:00]. While common in other nations, this would be a significant departure for the US as a [[global_reserve_currency_status_and_trade_deficits | global reserve currency]] issuer [03:45:00].

## Market Implications and the Role of Money Printing

The implementation of capital controls will lead to foreigners selling US assets, causing US markets (stocks, bonds) to decline [04:00:00]. This is expected to trigger a significant response from US authorities:

*   **Money Printing**: When markets decline, especially the [[us_bond_market_issues | bond market]], and volatility increases, the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve (Fed), and politicians are expected to print money [04:00:00]. This is necessary to provide dollars to replace the foreign capital that is leaving [04:11:00].
*   **Gold and Bitcoin Outperformance**: The consequence of this money printing will be a surge in the prices of gold and Bitcoin [04:23:00]. This is because these assets are seen as neutral stores of value, not tied to any single state's monetary system [04:26:00].
*   **US Bond Market Buyers**: With foreign demand for Treasuries diminishing, the buyers will primarily be the US commercial banking system, the Fed, and US retirement accounts [05:49:00].
    *   **Fed's Role**: Despite public statements about quantitative tightening (QT), the Fed has already been engaging in quantitative easing (QE) by buying 10-year bonds to keep yields down [05:46:00]. This covert QE is expected to become more overt, with expectations from powerful bankers like Jamie Dimon predicting a restart of full QE in 2026 [05:50:00]. This indicates that the Fed's ultimate goal is to fund the US government and preserve the empire, not solely to preserve the dollar's value [05:59:00].
    *   **Commercial Banks**: Regulations like the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR) can be adjusted to allow banks infinite leverage when purchasing Treasuries, incentivizing them to buy government debt [05:57:00].
    *   **Domestic Mandates**: Eventually, there may be mandates forcing domestic institutions like pension funds and university endowments to allocate a percentage of their portfolios to government bonds [06:22:00]. However, initial efforts will likely focus on making foreigners pay, as it's more politically palatable [06:37:00].

### The Future of Global Liquidity and Assets

*   **Decreased Trust in Fiat Systems**: As nation-states impose restrictions and manipulate their currencies, investors will increasingly seek assets that are not tied to any single system [04:26:00]. Gold and Bitcoin are positioned as the only truly independent assets that can be moved between systems as needed [04:46:00].
*   **Gold Revaluation (Possible)**: A "3D chess" move could involve the US government revaluing its substantial gold reserves (currently valued at $42/ounce) to current market prices, potentially creating trillions in "free money" to spend or reduce bond yields [02:22:00].
*   **No Hot War**: A full-scale hot war between the US and China is considered unlikely due to mutual economic ties and the political risks associated with public discontent over troop losses [02:25:00]. However, the economic "divorce" will proceed, potentially leading to a dual monetary system with a US bloc and a China bloc [02:44:00].
*   **Crypto's Role**: [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | Global liquidity]] is the primary driver for crypto asset values [01:16:00]. As money printing increases, Bitcoin and other crypto assets are expected to outperform traditional assets like stocks, though potentially with corrections as market expectations adjust [04:00:00].
*   **Stablecoins and Treasuries**: While stablecoins like Tether hold billions in T-bills, these are short-duration instruments. For stablecoins to significantly aid the Treasury, they would need to be incentivized or mandated to hold longer-duration bonds [03:37:00].
*   **US Crypto Policy**: The current US administration's pro-crypto stance is seen as a strategic move to attract the industry, though the specific legislation is likely to benefit large centralized companies (like Coinbase) rather than fostering truly permissionless innovation [01:07:00].

>[!WARNING] Risk to Thesis
>The main risk to the thesis of continuous money printing and rising crypto prices is a sudden shift to austerity and credit extinguishment, which would cause nominal prices of assets to fall significantly. However, this is deemed unlikely given current political incentives [09:56:00].

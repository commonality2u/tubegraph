The global payments market is enormous, with an estimated $200 trillion in cross-border transactions occurring annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Companies like Wise operate within this significant market.

## Wise and Its Business Model

Wise is recognized as a "great business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> that aimed to address a substantial portion of this market, specifically an estimated $50 trillion in potential revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, its operational model has certain characteristics:
*   **Capital Inefficiency**: Wise is described as a "capital inefficient" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Interconnectivity**: It requires significant "interconnectivity with the banking system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Operational Demands**: It also necessitates a lot of "operational connectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These operational requirements would be unnecessary if transactions were conducted via stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Role of Stablecoins as a Disruptor

Stablecoins are emerging as a potentially superior alternative for cross-border payments, particularly within the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market, which accounts for about 40% of the total cross-border payment volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Currently, only about $50 billion in cross-border transactions are processed using stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The potential for growth in this area is vast, with the current understanding of how to build valuable stablecoins estimated to be only about 5% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

Stablecoins are considered "functionally and unequivocally better" for cross-border payment use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, provided certain infrastructure challenges are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These challenges include:
*   Compliance concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Ensuring sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Solving the "last mile" problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

As these infrastructural elements are developed, a significant portion of the cross-border market, especially for SMBs, is expected to be better served by stablecoins and their underlying rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Existing players like Wise may either adopt stablecoin rails themselves or face displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

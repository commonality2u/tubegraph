A significant, yet underappreciated, factor in [[elon_musks_unique_qualities | Elon Musk's]] current effectiveness is his ability to assemble a highly talented collective of individuals around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Assembling a Talented Collective

Over the past 20 to 30 years, [[elon_musks_unique_qualities | Elon]] has gathered a group of approximately 20 people who are considered some of the most talented individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These individuals are rarely encountered, perhaps only a couple per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It typically requires about a decade of testing to fully understand their true potential and confirm their reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Each of [[elon_musks_unique_qualities | Elon's]] companies generally features around five exceptionally talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These core teams possess a "mind meld," enabling them to work together seamlessly, often without needing verbal communication to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The process of building such a self-sustaining and maximally effective organizational "organism" takes approximately 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

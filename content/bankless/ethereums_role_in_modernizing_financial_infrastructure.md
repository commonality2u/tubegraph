From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Ethereum is increasingly recognized as the default blockchain for modernizing financial infrastructure, positioned to bring the world's largest organizations on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. After ten years online without a single instance of downtime, Ethereum is considered ready for Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Ethereum's Advantages in Finance

Ethereum is highlighted as the only blockchain without downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, possessing the most tokenized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, the highest economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, and significant [[Ethereums roadmap towards institutional adoption | institutional adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Its commitment to being an open, permissionless, and credibly neutral platform has been its strategy for targeting the world's largest total addressable market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. The more politically neutral Ethereum becomes, the more it can attract larger institutions to build on its rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Ethereum aims to host entire governments and nation-state economies on its rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

Some parts of Wall Street have already recognized Ethereum's suitability for [[modernization_of_financial_markets_with_blockchain | institutional financial products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Examples include:
*   BlackRock placing a billion dollars of tokenized treasuries on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Franklin Templeton having tokenized funds on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Etherealize: Bridging Ethereum and Institutions

While institutions have come to Ethereum, Etherealize aims to bring Ethereum to institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Co-founders VC Raman (from Wall Street trading floors) and Danny Ryan (former [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] coordinator) lead this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:06">[06:48:06]</a>.

### Etherealize's Structure and Mission
Etherealize is structured as a Delaware C-Corp, with an expanding scope to include a nonprofit portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:09">[07:23:09]</a>. Its ultimate goal is to connect institutions to the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:09">[07:38:09]</a> and bring the world to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:09">[07:49:09]</a>.

The mission includes:
*   **Institutional Marketing and Business Development**: Educating Wall Street institutions that blockchains are a backend for capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:09">[12:03:09]</a>.
*   **Product Development**: Helping banks and institutions build products to bring their assets and user bases onto Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:09">[13:26:09]</a>.
*   **Non-profit Arm**: Focus on R&D, policy, and broader ecosystem marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:09">[14:03:09]</a>. This includes driving the [[ethereums_future_strategic_direction | Ethereum roadmap]] to keep it adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:09">[15:11:09]</a>.

The initial funding for Etherealize came from an [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] grant, which signaled legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:09">[21:46:09]</a>. Future funding is expected to come from client work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:09">[21:33:09]</a>. This creates a flywheel where client growth fuels the non-profit side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:09">[14:22:09]</a>, ensuring a comprehensive approach to adoption across technology, policy, and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:09">[16:06:09]</a>.

### Target Clients and Success Metrics
Etherealize's starting point is Wall Street, encompassing sell-side banks and asset managers (buy-side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:09">[16:57:09]</a>. They also engage with brokerages and mid-market funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:09">[18:02:09]</a>. The ultimate goal is to expand to fintech, governments (state, local, international) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:09">[18:28:09]</a>.

Success metrics for Etherealize include:
*   **Increased Tokenized Assets**: More assets tokenized and meaningfully utilized within the Ethereum economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:09">[18:39:09]</a>.
*   **Institutional L2 Adoption**: More institutional-scale Layer 2s (L2s) built, leveraging Ethereum's liquidity while allowing customization and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:09">[19:12:09]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Awareness**: Simplifying narratives and creating research to educate about why ETH is a good portfolio asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:09">[19:49:09]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges and Roadblocks

A significant roadblock for institutions has been regulatory uncertainty, which is now starting to clear with cases dropped by the SEC, willingness for tokenization rules, and upcoming stablecoin legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:09">[26:32:09]</a>. Many banks have already run internal, EVM-based private blockchains for years, making them familiar with Ethereum's underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:09">[26:38:09]</a>.

Etherealize helps institutions overcome operational challenges, including KYC and regulatory compliance, by providing hands-on product development and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:09">[27:26:09]</a>. The focus is on integrating blockchain technology into existing processes like order flows and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:09">[27:56:09]</a>.

## Vision for the Future of Finance

The long-term vision is for banks to become "DeFi-pill'd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:09">[29:39:09]</a>, utilizing the full "superpowers" of blockchains, including permissionless borrowing, lending, trading, and programmatic product structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:09">[29:29:09]</a>. This involves a one-time upgrade and shift of the financial system from physical old settlement to blockchain substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:09">[12:19:09]</a>.

The goal is to guide institutions to their "Uniswap moment," where they experience permissionless trading of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:09">[28:51:09]</a>. While DeFi might not be the first stop, tokenizing assets and building L2 ecosystems are initial steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:09">[29:10:09]</a>.

## Synergies and Ecosystem Evolution

Etherealize works in parallel with changes in the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF), which is entering a new era with co-executive directors Tomas and Shae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:09">[31:12:09]</a>. This shift aims for the EF to be more opinionated and act as a counterbalancing force against powerful external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:09">[34:16:09]</a>. This new approach seeks to move Ethereum into a more aggressive and growth-oriented phase, while maintaining its core values of decentralization and credible neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:09">[32:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:09">[36:28:09]</a>.

Danny Ryan emphasizes that Ethereum's resilient, multi-client, and diverse ecosystem allows the EF to have stronger opinions and provides room for other players like Etherealize to fill voids and advocate for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:09">[43:37:09]</a>.

### Navigating the Political Landscape
The onboarding of financial institutions and real-world assets is seen as critical to ensuring that the "regulatory pendulum" can only swing so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48:09">[46:48:09]</a>. Once the U.S. economy has a dependency on blockchains, undoing this integration becomes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:09">[46:58:09]</a>.

Etherealize advocates that "technology is bipartisan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:09">[49:02:09]</a>. Rules enabling stablecoins as a global distribution mechanism for the dollar and tokenization rules benefit all parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:09">[49:10:09]</a>. Institutions think long-term and understand the value of decentralized systems, security, and the trade-offs Ethereum has made to remain a neutral layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:14:09">[50:14:09]</a>. Ethereum aims to remain the default choice regardless of the political regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:09">[50:30:09]</a>.

### Community Support and Protocol Evolution
The Ethereum community can support Etherealize by bringing opportunities their way, such as RFPs from governments or tokenization projects in contention with other blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:09">[51:31:09]</a>. It's crucial for the community to identify and fill existing vacuums in the ecosystem, whether in application incubation or global identity solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:09">[52:53:09]</a>.

From a protocol standpoint, scaling efficiency at Layer 1 and Layer 2 is critical for global adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:15:09">[54:15:09]</a>. Other areas for evolution include wallet standards to manage L2 complexity and privacy models in the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:09">[54:48:09]</a>. L2s are considered the "ultimate experimentation zone" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:09">[56:04:09]</a>, fostering innovation and a feedback loop to the mainnet to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:09">[57:07:09]</a>.

Etherealize is actively hiring the "best of Ethereum" and "best of Wall Street," with the vision that one day the financial system will be an Ethereum system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

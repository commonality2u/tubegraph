A significant scandal involving a memecoin launch, the "Libra" token, unfolded in the third week of February, implicating Argentina's President Javier Milei and highlighting broader issues within the cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This event brought to light problematic [[ethics_and_strategies_in_memecoin_launches | memecoin launch strategies]] and raised questions about the [[role_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | role of meme coins]] in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## The Libra Token Launch

On Valentine's Day at 5:01 PM Eastern Time, Javier Milei tweeted about a project called "Viva libad pro.com" with the ticker "Libra" and a Solana contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He stated the project was dedicated to encouraging the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small Argentine businesses and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The Libra token immediately launched at an approximate $2.5 billion valuation, jumped to $5.5 billion within 30 minutes, and then plummeted to $30 million within 90 minutes of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Key red flags included 82% of the token supply being held by one cluster of wallets that spawned the token, and a complete lack of shared tokenomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Initial red flags:
> *   Immediate, massive valuation swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
> *   82% of tokens held by a single wallet cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
> *   No tokenomics shared, unlike previous tokens like the Trump token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Javier Milei's Denials

A few hours after his initial tweet, Javier Milei posted a follow-up stating he had "countless times supporting a supposed private projects which I obviously have no connection to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He subsequently deleted the original tweet and concluded his denial by attacking "the filthy rra of the political Castle who want to take advantage of this situation due to harm," confirming his conviction to "kick them out in the ARs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Hayden Davies: The Central Figure

A previously unheard-of individual named Hayden Davies, from KELCEY Ventures, emerged as a central figure behind the Libra launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Davies attempted to explain the situation, blaming "sniper bots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, in an interview with scam exposer Coffeezilla, Hayden Davies admitted that KELCEY Ventures had "sniped the Libra Supply ahead to get to front run actual snipers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. His behavior during the interview was compared to Sam Bankman-Fried's post-FTX publicity tour, seemingly unaware of potential legal trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Davies also admitted involvement in the launch of the "Melania token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. He reportedly gained access to Javier Milei by reaching out to his sister, sending her money and stating she was "in her total control," which then facilitated access to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Meteora and Jupiter's Implication

The scandal also drew in Jupiter and Meteora, Solana-based DeFi platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Meow, the founder of Jupiter, issued a statement clarifying that while early Jupiter employees were seen trading the Libra token, Jupiter itself had no involvement or insider information regarding the token's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Meteora, founded by Meow as a more sophisticated AMM, did not have the same level of deniability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Ben Chow from Meteora stepped down, attempting to distance himself from the Libra launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, a continuous association between Meteora and Hayden Davies was revealed, extending to the M3 token (related to Meteora's own memecoin) and the Melania token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Speculation arose that Meteora itself might have been trying to "snipe the supply ahead of Hayden Davies," suggesting an internal conflict over front-running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Market Impact and Comparisons

This scandal has been described as the "worst thing in the crypto industry since FTX," though not as severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. It exposed the "industrialization of the [[ethics_and_strategies_in_memecoin_launches | memecoin launch]]," where what started as a "relatively fair fun casino" turned into a space with "no rules no regulations no guard rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] Dave Portnoy's Involvement
> Dave Portnoy was paid Libra tokens by Hayden Davies to promote the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. He returned the tokens (valued at millions of dollars) because Hayden requested he not disclose the promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Portnoy later received a refund from Hayden Davies for his losses after buying the token with insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The incident led to a significant downturn in the memecoin market, with an estimated $6 billion erased from the sector's market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Bloomberg reported on the "Argentina Scandal fuels sell off on favorite mcoin platform," referring to Solana, which is the dominant chain for memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

The debate over the "griftiness" of memecoins intensified, with Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko arguing that "DeFi summer was way worse" due to contagion risks, while memecoins have "virtually no contagion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Critics pointed out that while DeFi Summer had leverage loops, ICOs in 2018 were also rife with fraud, with projects raising hundreds of millions and then evaporating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The argument was made that memecoin "rugs" often occurred before exchange listings, limiting the extracted liquidity compared to larger ICOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. However, it was acknowledged that bad actors were "improving their techniques" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, leading to the rapid industrialization of memecoin launches within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Regulatory Response and Self-Policing

In response to widespread fraud, including incidents like the Libra scandal, the SEC announced the creation of a "Cyber and Emerging Technologies unit to protect retail investors," often referred to as the "SEC's Cyber police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. This unit will focus on fraud committed using emerging technologies like AI and machine learning, social media, the dark web, and "fraud involving blockchain technology and crypto assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

Despite the prevalence of fraud in crypto cycles (ICO Mania, DeFi Summer, NFTs, memecoins), some argue that the potential risk of over-regulation is higher than the cost of ongoing fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. The concern is that while regulatory intervention might target obvious fraud, it could also stifle innovation and lead to unintended consequences if power falls into the wrong hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. The emphasis was placed on the industry's responsibility to "self-police" and build structures that prevent fraud and corruption, rather than relying solely on external bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Political Aftermath
> PolyMarket odds indicated a 16% chance of Javier Milei being impeached by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Argentinian locals reportedly view this as an opportunistic move by Milei's opposition, with little weight given that his party controls the Congress required for impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) serves as a central point and coordinator for the broader Ethereum operation, acting almost like a compass for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It is a non-profit organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Vision

The EF recently appointed two new co-executive directors, Tamas Stanjac and Shiae Wong, who are seen as bringing more operational leadership to the Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This [[Ethereum Foundation Leadership Changes | leadership transition]] is viewed as one of many shifts needed for Ethereum's direction, leaving many hopeful for its progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Core Mission

The EF's mission is to be the steward of the ecosystem, to "stand up when the ecosystem need us the most," and to empower other players to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. A key aspect of their vision is to be the most decentralized, permissionless, and open blockchain in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. They aim to balance growth with core principles like privacy, security, open source access, and censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Tamas Stanjac sees his role as dynamic, focusing on short-term changes to make the foundation dynamic and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. He aims to bring an "energy of experience" from building organizations and working within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Shiae Wong aims to "lead with clarity and move with purpose and build without attachment," emphasizing that the work is for the world they want to live in, not personal legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Operational Goals and Challenges

The new leadership's vision for the [[Ethereum roadmap and priorities | Ethereum roadmap and priorities]] centers on three key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>:

1.  **Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1):** Demonstrating strength and ensuring Ethereum mainnet continues to outperform competitors in research quality, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s:** Supporting the massive success of the Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem by ensuring L1 provides the anchoring layer from which L2s borrow security and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX):** Addressing concerns about L1 and L2 not feeling like one chain, improving interoperability, enhancing security, and reducing latency for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This also includes DevX (Developer Experience) to ensure builders have clarity, tooling, and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

The EF aims for accelerated upgrade cadences, targeting hard forks every six months, a significant speed-up from the historical 12-18 month average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. They plan to immediately spawn devnets for future forks, such as Fusaka after Pectra, and prevent delays by removing features that might hinder timely delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. A long-term goal for L1 scaling is a 100x improvement over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Addressing Community Concerns

The EF is actively working to address community concerns, including:
*   **Speed and Delivery:** Many feel the EF has been slow, lacking the ability to accelerate timelines and commit to deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The new leadership believes these issues are "very much fixable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Communication:** There is a need for clearer communication of the [[Ethereum roadmap and priorities | roadmap]] and milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The EF aims to be more communicative and not avoid difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **"Ivory Tower" Perception:** Some feel the EF is disconnected from the true use cases of daily DeFi users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The leadership intends to bring a "product-centric" approach, involving users and application developers in the co-design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Scope and Misconceptions

The Ethereum Foundation operates differently from a centralized company like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. It is not the "owner" of the Ethereum protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

Key points about what the EF does *not* primarily do or is *not* expected to do:
*   **Hold ETH:** The EF must sell ETH to fund its operations, including over 200 internal efforts and grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Community expectation to hold ETH is considered unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Engineering of Client Software:** While EF has a Go Ethereum (Geth) team that builds an execution layer client, it does not build consensus layer clients (like Eric Stella) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The broader ecosystem is capable of handling such development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Business Development/Marketing:** The EF avoids directly coordinating efforts to talk to Wall Street or governments, though it remains available to answer questions as a knowledgeable organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. It seeks to be a "helper" and "business developer" by connecting organizations, helping applications find customers or talent, and offering solutions beyond just grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. While exploring marketing, it emphasizes communication and clarity over traditional branding or advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

The EF aims to fill gaps where no other organization is present, sometimes highlighting a problem to encourage others to build solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. The goal is to empower others to take decisions and accelerate progress, fostering a decentralized yet faster-moving ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

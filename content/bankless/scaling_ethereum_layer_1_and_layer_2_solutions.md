The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is embarking on a new phase, with a clear focus on enhancing the network's scalability, improving its usability, and accelerating development timelines. This strategic shift is being spearheaded by the new co-executive directors of the Ethereum Foundation, Tamas and Shiae, who aim to transform Ethereum into a more product-centric ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Core Objectives for Ethereum's Future

The new leadership has articulated three primary objectives that will guide Ethereum's development over the next year:
1.  **[[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Scaling the Ethereum Layer 1]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
2.  **[[ethereums_layer_2_rollup_strategy | Scaling blobs for Layer 2s]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>

These points are seen as crucial for solidifying Ethereum's position as a "global neutral layer for all the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>.

## Addressing Past [[challenges_and_solutions_in_ethereum_scaling | Challenges and Solutions]]

For years, the Ethereum community has observed a perceived "slowness" in development and communication from the EF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The transition to new leadership is intended to bring more operational capacity and accelerate upgrade cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

This shift aims to address community concerns, including:
*   **Accelerating timelines** and committing to clear delivery schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
*   **Improving communication** of the roadmap, making it simpler and more milestone-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **Moving out of the "ivory tower"** perception by connecting more directly with DeFi users and real-world use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

Tamas believes these problems are "very much fixable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a> by empowering internal teams, increasing communication, and leveraging the strong desire of the broader Ethereum community to contribute to the network's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

## Specific Scaling Efforts

### [[ethereum_layer_1_versus_layer_2_dynamics | Scaling Ethereum Layer 1]]

The renewed focus on [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | scaling Layer 1]] emphasizes its role as the foundational layer that provides security and decentralization for the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. The goal is to ensure the Ethereum mainnet remains strong and continues to "outclass competitors" in terms of research quality, protocol strength, decentralization, security, and throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. A key metric is achieving a 100x scaling over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

### [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Scaling Blobs for Layer 2s]]

The commitment to [[ethereums_layer_2_rollup_strategy | scaling blobs]] signifies strong support for the [[role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_crypto | Layer 2 ecosystem]], which has been instrumental in bringing users and scaling Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Blobs provide the necessary data availability space for Layer 2 solutions, enabling them to inherit Layer 1's security and decentralization while offering higher throughput and lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

### Improving User Experience

Improving UX encompasses a wide range of initiatives, including:
*   **Interoperability standards** between Layer 1 and Layer 2s to make them feel like a unified chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.
*   **Ease of use and asset management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
*   **Enhanced security** to ensure users feel comfortable using the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.
*   **Reduced latency** for block confirmations and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Developer experience (DevX)**: ensuring builders have great tooling, clear roadmaps, and strong ecosystem support to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

This focus points to a "product-centric Ethereum," where development is driven by user needs and clear goals, ensuring that every change makes an impact on people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

## Hard Fork Cadence and Future Plans

Historically, Ethereum hard forks occurred every 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. The new plan is to accelerate this cadence to every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

*   **Pectra**: Scheduled around May 7th, focusing on UX improvements like Account Abstraction via EIP-7102 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
*   **Fasaka**: Planned for September/October, with devnets spawning immediately after Pectra's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.
*   **Glamsterdam**: Projected for March to June of next year, with expectations for significant L1 scaling acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

These accelerated timelines are supported by increased operational efficiency and a restructuring of core developer formats to foster faster testing and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.

## The Ethereum Foundation's Role

The Ethereum Foundation acts as a "steward of the ecosystem" and a central coordinator, aiming to empower other players rather than controlling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. The EF's mission is to be available where needs are unmet, either by addressing them directly or by helping new organizations appear and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.

The EF clarifies that it is **not** responsible for:
*   **Speculating on ETH price** or solely holding ETH; it needs to sell ETH to fund operations and grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Directly building consensus layer clients** or all infrastructure; this is done by separate, decentralized teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.
*   **Acting as an "owner"** of the Ethereum protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>.

Instead, the EF focuses on:
*   **Research and coordination** for major protocol changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Providing grants** and supporting ecosystem development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
*   **Facilitating connections** between organizations, founders, and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.
*   **Being a knowledgeable resource** for institutions and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.
*   **Improving communication** and clarity within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

The new leadership aims to ensure Ethereum's continued growth and impact, making it accessible and robust for all users and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>.

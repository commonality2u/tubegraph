The global payments market is substantial, with an estimated $200 trillion in cross-border transactions occurring annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While [[stablecoins_in_crossborder_payments | stablecoins]] currently account for about $50 billion of this cross-border volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, there's significant potential for their growth and adoption. The development of a truly valuable [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoin]] is considered to be only about 5% complete, indicating vast unexplored possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Advantages in Cross-Border Payments

For cross-border payment use cases, [[stablecoins_as_an_alternative_to_traditional_banking | stablecoins]] are deemed "functionally and unequivocally better" than traditional methods, provided that [[challenges_and_infrastructure_needs_for_stablecoin_adoption | infrastructure problems]] are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Solving these infrastructure challenges involves addressing compliance concerns, ensuring sufficient liquidity, reducing costs, and establishing "last mile" solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Once these are in place, a significant portion of cross-border payments, particularly within the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market (which constitutes about 40% of the total volume), will be better served by [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoins and stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Inefficiencies of Traditional Systems

Traditional financial businesses, like Wise, which aim to address a $50 trillion revenue market, are described as capital inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These businesses heavily rely on extensive interconnectivity with the traditional banking system and require significant operational connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Such complexities and inefficiencies would not be necessary if transactions were conducted on [[stablecoins_as_an_alternative_to_traditional_banking | stablecoin rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This suggests that the [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_financial_systems_and_fintech | impact of stablecoins]] could lead to existing players adopting stablecoin technology or facing displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

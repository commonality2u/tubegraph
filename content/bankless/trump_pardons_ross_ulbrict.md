On January 21st, the first full day of his presidency, [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | President Trump]] issued a full and unconditional pardon for Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:33">[04:47:33]</a>. This act followed promises made by [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | Trump]] during his campaign, specifically at the Bitcoin conference and the Libertarian National Party convention, where he pledged to free Ulbricht on "day one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:90">[05:24:90]</a>.

## The Pardon: Fulfillment of a Promise

The pardon was confirmed by Donald Trump Jr. via a Truth Social post, expressing that it was done in honor of Ulbricht's mother and the Libertarian movement that strongly supported [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. The "Free Ross" Twitter account also shared the news, stating, "Ross has just been granted a full and unconditional pardon by Donald Trump. Words cannot express how grateful we are. President Trump is a man of his word and he just saved Ross's life. Ross is a free man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:15">[07:22:15]</a>.

Ross Ulbricht's mother, Lynn Ulbricht, had tirelessly campaigned for her son's release for 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. The pardon concluded a significant chapter for Ulbricht, who was serving a double life sentence plus 40 years for his role in creating and operating Silk Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road Legacy

Ross Ulbricht founded the Silk Road dark market, known for facilitating the sale of illegal drugs and other items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Despite its illicit associations, Silk Road also functioned as a permissionless marketplace where legal goods, memorabilia, and collectibles were traded, akin to a "permissionless eBay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

The existence of Silk Road heavily influenced the early public perception of Bitcoin, leading to the "blockchain, not Bitcoin" narrative, where blockchain technology was praised while Bitcoin was largely dismissed as a tool for criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. However, it also showcased Bitcoin's "unstoppable, permissionless, censorship-resistant nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

### The Controversial Sentence
Ulbricht's sentence of a double life sentence plus 40 years for non-violent crimes, without conviction for alleged assassinations or evidence of victims, was widely considered "extreme and egregious" by many, including libertarians and some moderates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Proponents of Ulbricht argue he created a safer, more private marketplace for activities, reflecting a libertarian philosophy against "unenforceable prohibition" like the War on Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

## Implications for Bitcoin and Crypto

The pardon of Ross Ulbricht is seen as a significant "bookend" to a period where Bitcoin was heavily associated with illicit activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. From a "promises made, promises kept" perspective, it is considered bullish for the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

### Ulbricht's Bitcoins and Government Holdings
There is speculation regarding whether Ulbricht retains access to any unconfiscated Bitcoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. While a full and unconditional pardon theoretically makes it "as if the crimes never occurred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>, a Supreme Court ruling related to Civil War amnesties suggested pardons don't automatically return proceeds of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. The US government still holds a sizable chunk of Bitcoin, including remaining Silk Road coins and Bitfinex recovery coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:10]</a>.

## Broader Context: The Crypto Ball and a "Golden Age"

The pardon coincides with a "whirlwind" of pro-crypto sentiment surrounding [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | the Trump administration]]'s inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This included the "Crypto Ball" in Washington D.C., a celebration organized by Bitcoin Inc. and sponsored by major crypto firms like Galaxy, MetaMask, Uniswap, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Many crypto firms also contributed significantly to [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Crypto industry leaders like Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), Jesse Powell (Kraken), Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy), David Sachs, and Sergey Nazarov (Chainlink) were visibly present throughout the weekend, signaling a strong industry presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This aligns with the expectation of a "golden age" for crypto in America under the new administration, which is anticipated to have a "much more open-minded and hands-off approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Shifts and Future Outlook

The new administration is ushering in changes at regulatory bodies. Mark Ureda has been named the acting SEC chair, and a new crypto task force will be led by Hester Peirce, both known for their pro-crypto stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This new leadership is expected to lead to a "widespread halting of enforcements in crypto pending further review and possibly the pausing or withdrawing of major litigation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Tornado Cash Sanctions Lifted
Further evidence of a shifting landscape came with the court lifting OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>. The ruling explicitly stated that Tornado Cash smart contracts are not property, which challenges OFAC's previous justification for sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>. This is seen as a significant win for crypto privacy advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a>. The industry hopes for similar outcomes for individuals like Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the Tornado Cash developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:34:00">[56:34:00]</a>.

### [[Trump Branded Cryptocurrency | Trump's Meme Coin]] Launch
During the inauguration weekend, [[Trump branded cryptocurrency | Donald Trump also launched an official Trump meme coin]] on Solana, which quickly reached a multi-billion dollar market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. This move, while seen by some as potentially dilutive or a "grift," is consistent with [[Donald Trumps administrations economic policies | Trump's]] history of branded memorabilia and his embrace of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>. The transparency around the coin's supply schedule, despite some missing information, is noted as a positive aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

The collective events, including the pardon, the crypto ball, and the regulatory shifts, indicate a significant positive turning point for the digital assets industry in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

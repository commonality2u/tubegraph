Bankless is renewing its focus on [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum]], seeing it as becoming interesting again after a period where its direction felt misaligned with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The last six months have shown [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum]] realigning itself to a new future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Bankless has always had [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum]] in its DNA, considering it its "first love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. There is now an opportunity for Bankless to support [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum]], whereas in 2023, there wasn't much to support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## The Ethereum Reboot

Just as an individual might need a "reboot" to realign, [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | Ethereum]] also needed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This reboot appears to be happening, with a reprioritization of the Layer 1 (L1) network, asserting its strength relative to Layer 2s (L2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. The L1 is "putting itself first," which is viewed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.

## Market Performance and Narrative Challenges

Since January 16th, ETH/USD has been down 48%, falling from $3,400 to $1,750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. The entire [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum ecosystem]], including DeFi tokens and L2s, is currently down relative to Bitcoin and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. It is currently "losing the meme game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

### The "Bitcoin Religion" vs. Ethereum's "Building" Ethos
One perspective suggests that ETH has been "outplayed by the Bitcoin religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. While [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] emphasizes being a community of builders and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>, it has "not built the meme base layer, has not built the cult, has not built the religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. This is seen as a problem if [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] aims to become a global store of value asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

Bitcoin's success in becoming a "strategic reserve" and gaining political favor is attributed to its "cult" and grassroots effort, including figures like Michael Saylor and David Bailey influencing politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This contrasts with [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] "opting out" of such political alignment, perceiving itself as "too good for that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

### Credible Neutrality and Asset Positioning
The argument for Bitcoin's strong credible neutrality stems from the "immaculate conception" story and the elimination of Satoshi Nakamoto's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. In contrast, the mere existence of Vitalik Buterin and the [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum Foundation]] is argued to disqualify [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] as a monetary asset for central bank inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

However, it is argued that this is a "religious proposition" for Bitcoin, and there are different types of "religions" that can form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. While Bitcoin's neutrality is a strength, it does not preclude [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] from becoming a global monetary asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. The current market is pricing in the uncertainty of whether [[Ethereums operational goals and challenges | Ethereum]] can regain ground in the global store of value reserve asset conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite current challenges, [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum]] is seen as slowly undergoing a "reboot" that Bankless believes it can support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The pivot involves a renewed focus on [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum]]'s core Layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. This, combined with Bitcoin's elevation to a non-sovereign store of value, are considered the two most interesting stories in crypto currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. While there are open questions about its narrative positioning, the potential for [[Ethereums strategic pivot and its implications | Ethereum]] to appreciate in price in the future remains a possibility if it works on its community and narrative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

A notable [[shift_in_focus_of_the_ethereum_tech_stack | shift in focus of the Ethereum tech stack]] is occurring, aiming to make it a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This development is seen as providing positive feedback to Ether, the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The community's pursuit of Ether as a commodity asset, with a commodity-like shelling point and store-of-value focus, is bolstered by Ethereum's strength as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Higher fees and burn rates within Ethereum are believed to strengthen Ether as a commodity money asset within the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dual Perspectives: Product vs. Asset

The Ethereum ecosystem faces a unique tension between two necessary approaches:

### Ethereum as a Product
For the technology side of Ethereum, a "Vitalic Buterin style convexity" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. As a community, flexibility, adaptability, openness, and niceness are crucial when discussing Ethereum as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Ether as an Asset
In contrast, when discussing Ether the asset, the approach must shift to "concavity" and be extremely [[maximalism_and_nationalism_in_ethereum | maximalist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This requires being strong and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Challenge of Duality

The challenge for the ecosystem is the difficulty of maintaining both these stances simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's not about choosing one lane, but rather being able to operate in both lanes and select the appropriate perspective based on the context of the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

For instance:
*   When discussing Ether the asset with Wall Street, a "yachty maximalist" stance might be appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   When engaging with application builders choosing a platform, a pragmatic approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This necessity to navigate both extremes is described as daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

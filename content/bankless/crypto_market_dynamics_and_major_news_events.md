## Macro Factors Impacting Crypto Markets

Three [[macro_factors_impacting_crypto_markets | macro catalysts]] are identified as important for [[crypto_market_trends_and_forecasts | crypto investors]] over the next three to six months: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>

### 1. Tariff-Driven Recession

The probability of a recession in 2025 is priced at 62% by PolyMarket. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> First-quarter GDP numbers were negative 0.3%, missing the consensus of 0.3% growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> This miss is largely attributed to tariffs, including a new baseline 10% tariff by the US on global partners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, states that this is the "new normal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>

A report from Apollo predicts a summertime recession in 2025, driven by tariffs causing container ships to halt at US ports, leading to a stop in trucking demand, and subsequent layoffs in the trucking and retail industries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> A recession is generally viewed as negative for crypto in the short term, as crypto is perceived as a risk-on asset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>

### 2. American Capital Flight

The trend of "American capital flight" is observed as US stocks and bonds decline, while gold skyrockets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> The S&P is down 4-5% and NASDAQ is down 8% on the year, while gold is up 33%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> This suggests a shift away from traditional US assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

Bitcoin has started to trade more like gold since the tariff announcements, fluctuating between tracking NASDAQ and gold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> If capital flight continues, it could be bullish for Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market in the long term, as it aligns with the thesis of crypto providing a credibly neutral alternative to fiat monetary systems and property rights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>

### 3. Increasing Global Money Supply (M2)

Global M2 (money supply) is entering a new upward cycle after a period of decrease, as noted by Raoul Pal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> In response to economic pain from recessions and capital flight, governments are expected to turn on money printers, which would inflate fiat currencies globally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> This is seen as bullish for crypto, as it increases the attractiveness of permissionless, open, and credibly neutral monetary systems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>

Ray Dalio's recent essay, "It's Too Late. The Changes Are Coming," suggests that domestic, political, and international world orders are breaking down due to unsustainable fundamentals, leading to a new monetary order. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>

## Ethereum Developments

### Ethereum Foundation Restructuring and Strategic Shift

The [[ethereums_price_increase_and_market_dynamics | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF) has announced a leadership restructuring, with Shiae and Tamas as new co-executive directors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a> The EF's board of directors now includes Vitalik Buterin, Aya Miyaguchi, Patrick Storchenegger, and Shiae, overseeing the EF's vision, values, and executive appointments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>

Tamas identified three near-term goals for the next 12 months: scaling Layer 1, scaling blobs, and improving UX. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a> This signals a shift towards a "product-centric roadmap," as opposed to solely a rollup-centric one, incorporating a strong Layer 1 focus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>

There is debate on whether this constitutes a "pivot" or a "reprioritization." Scaling the L1 was not seen as a priority on the roadmap months ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a> While scaling the L1 was always a long-term goal, the new emphasis brings it to the forefront. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> Some argue that calling it a pivot is important for acknowledging past shortcomings and showing adaptability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a> The change in leadership and cultural shift within the EF are seen as positive developments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>

Dankrad Feist proposed an EIP to scale [[ethereum_price_surge_and_market_dynamics | Ethereum L1]] 100x over the next four years, stating that the current approach risks Ethereum becoming irrelevant within 5-10 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> He suggests committing to a scaling timeline to provide clear goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>

Vitalik Buterin's personal focuses for 2025 include Layer 1 long-term roadmap (single-slot finality, VM statelessness, security, resilience, decentralization) and "defensive acceleration" (DACK), which includes comms tools like Signal, infra, and social layer mechanism design. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>

### Layer 2 Milestones

Two major Ethereum Layer 2s, Base and Scroll, reached Stage 1 decentralization on L2Beat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a> Stage 1 indicates a significant reduction in unilateral control by operators and strong user protections, often achieved through a security council requiring high consensus for upgrades. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a> This is a crucial step towards decentralization for these rollups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>

## Worldcoin's US Rollout

Worldcoin is expanding its presence in the US, deploying Orbs (iris scanning devices) in six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> They plan to open "Apple-like in-person stores" for users to get orbed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a> New users receive 16 World Tokens upon iris scanning, while existing users get a pioneer grant of 150 World Tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a> (150 World Tokens equates to $150 at $1.00 per token). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>

Despite initial "dystopian" perceptions, public sentiment towards Worldcoin is shifting due to the increasing threat of AI bots and propaganda online. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a> Worldcoin states they do not store eyeball images, only creating a hash and discarding the data, suggesting their security practices are robust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a> Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg expressed that Worldcoin is the "only thing in crypto that is really interesting" to him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>

## Bitcoin's Growing Political Influence in the US

A Trump administration executive director stated on camera that there is a "space race" among countries to accumulate Bitcoin, which is viewed as "digital gold." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a> The administration seeks to accumulate as much as possible through creative, budget-neutral methods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>

According to CoinGecko, governments currently hold about 2.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, primarily the US and China, acquired from nefarious actors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a> The Bitcoin narrative has progressed significantly, with even the White House acknowledging it as a digital gold asset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>

Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin will be treated like oil or gold, not as a currency, by the administration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>

## Crypto Ecosystem Shenanigans

### Movement Labs Under Investigation

## Conclusion

The crypto market continues to evolve, influenced by both internal developments within blockchain ecosystems and broader [[crypto_market_reactions_to_economic_instability | macroeconomic factors]]. The ongoing debate within Ethereum about its roadmap, the rise of sovereign-aligned assets like Bitcoin, and the increasing convergence of crypto with mainstream finance and politics indicate a dynamic and complex future for the industry.

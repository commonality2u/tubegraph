Even prior to blockchain technology, [[pre_blockchain_internet_finance | internet finance]] existed, allowing users to access bank accounts online, such as with Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this form of finance primarily uses the internet as a communication layer rather than as the foundation for financial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Internet as a Communication Mechanism, Not a Core System

The current setup of financial transactions over the internet can be likened to ordering pizza via GrubHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The pizza itself is not made on the internet; the internet merely serves as a communication channel between the customer and the analog pizza shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Similarly, in traditional finance, a message is sent to an entity like Wells Fargo, which then conducts the transaction within its own "permissioned silo database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This database is not part of the open internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Therefore, [[the role of internet in modern finance | the internet's role]] is limited to communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Siloed Databases and Internal Record-Keeping

Financial ownership and transactions in existing systems are not inherently internet-native. Instead, they reside in private, often analog, systems:
*   **Startup Ownership** Ownership of a startup's equity might exist as an entry on a team's spreadsheet, listing investor names and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Stock Ownership** When an individual owns shares, for example, 100 shares of Apple on Robinhood, Robinhood maintains a server with a database entry recording this ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This system then interfaces with a depository trust company, which in turn works with the company (e.g., Apple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This demonstrates that what is commonly referred to as [[internet_financial_system | internet finance]] is, in reality, finance managed within siloed databases that occasionally communicate over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

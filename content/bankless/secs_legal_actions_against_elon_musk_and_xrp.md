The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] has recently been active in its enforcement actions, particularly in the final days of Gary Gensler's presumed tenure, targeting high-profile individuals and revisiting previous legal battles involving crypto assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## SEC vs. Elon Musk

Elon Musk is currently being sued by the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] in what has been described as part of an ongoing "beef" between the two parties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a> The lawsuit stems from Musk's alleged late disclosure of his Twitter (now X) stake. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>

### Details of the Lawsuit
On January 14th, the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] filed a complaint in a Washington D.C. federal court, alleging that Musk's delay in disclosing his Twitter holdings allowed him to purchase shares at artificially low prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a> This reportedly resulted in him underpaying by at least $150 million for shares acquired after his beneficial ownership report was due. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>

Musk began buying Twitter stock in early 2022, accumulating over 5% of its outstanding common stock by March 14th of that year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a> SEC regulations required him to file a report disclosing his holdings within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> However, Musk filed this report 11 days late, on April 4th, 2022. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a> On the day his report was filed, Twitter's stock price surged by more than 27% compared to its previous day's closing price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a> He later acquired Twitter for $44 billion on April 25th, 2022. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>

The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] is requesting a jury trial and demanding that Musk "disgorge his unjust enrichment" along with a civil penalty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>

### Reactions
Elon Musk responded on Twitter, calling the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] a "totally broken organization" that spends its time on trivial matters while "many actual crimes go unpunished." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a> His lawyer, Alex Shapiro, referred to the action as a "single count Ticky taky complaint" and an admission by the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] that "they cannot bring an actual case," asserting that "Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>

Public sentiment appears divided, with some cheering on the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]], viewing Musk as a "billionaire cutting corners." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>

## SEC vs. XRP (Ripple)

The [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] is also seeking to repeal a previous court ruling that differentiated the classification of XRP. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>

### Background of the Lawsuit
Previously, the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] asserted that nearly every crypto token traded on secondary markets constituted a security. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a> However, a court ruling in the Ripple case provided a "glimpse of hope" for the crypto industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>

The judge ruled that initial, off-chain sales of XRP (e.g., manual paper agreements to banks) were considered securities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a> Crucially, the ruling stated that on-chain transfers or transactions on centralized exchanges did *not* constitute a security transaction, meaning the XRP token itself, when traded on secondary markets, was not classified as a security. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a> This decision led to XRP being relisted on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, reversing its previous removal due to the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]]'s initial stance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>

### Current Developments
Despite the previous ruling, the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]] is now "asking for a repeal" on that securities classification. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> This move comes just days before the change in presidential administration, suggesting a final push in their current stance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>

### Impact of New Administration
With Donald Trump entering office, expected to be a "pro crypto president," there is anticipation of a significant shift in [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | crypto regulation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> It is speculated that Trump might dismiss "frivolous cases from the [[sec_and_crypto_regulation | SEC]]" initiated against U.S.-based crypto companies like Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, and Robinhood. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>

Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uesda of the [[secs_crypto_task_force_with_mark_uesda | SEC's Crypto Task Force]] are reportedly considering initiating processes to provide guidance or rules clarifying when a cryptocurrency is considered a security, and reviewing existing crypto enforcement cases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> The incoming Trump administration's [[role_of_the_sec_and_future_of_crypto_regulations | new SEC leadership]] is poised for a "crypto overhaul," which may include new regulations and a freeze on some enforcement actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a> This suggests a potential "command Z" on many current [[challenges_and_changes_in_cryptorelated_enforcement_actions | enforcement actions]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>

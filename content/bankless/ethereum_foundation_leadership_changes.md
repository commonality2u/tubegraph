The [[ethereum_ecosystem_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] is undergoing significant [[evolution_of_ethereum_foundation_and_leadership | leadership changes]] within the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF), marking a new phase for the organization and its stewardship of the [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

## Transition of Executive Director

Aya Miyaguchi, the former executive director of the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]], has transitioned into the role of President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. Her period of [[evolution_of_ethereum_foundation_and_leadership | leadership]] was characterized by a "philosophy of addition by subtraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.

## New Co-Executive Directors

Replacing Miyaguchi are two new co-executive directors who will begin their roles on March 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>:

*   **Hiia Weing Wei** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>: A researcher at the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] for the past seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Thomas Sachsak** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>: CEO of Nethermind, credited with scaling the Nethermind project from an early stage to a global company and skilled in talent recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

The specific definition or focus of this new [[Ethereum Foundations new leadership and its goals | leadership phase]] is currently unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. The co-executive director model can be seen as "messy" and potentially splitting viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. However, there is an expectation that the new [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | leadership]] will be responsive to the [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum community]] and implement changes in the [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation's]] operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

## Danny Ryan's New Role

Many in the [[changes_in_the_ethereum_foundation_and_community_dynamics | Ethereum community]] had hoped for Danny Ryan, the engineer coordinator who helped ship the Merge, to become the new Executive Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. While he did not get the EF ED position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, Ryan has announced his co-founding of [[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

[[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereal]] is described as a "pseudo second Foundation" intended to act as a liaison between the [[Ethereum ecosystem and leadership changes | Ethereum ecosystem]] and traditional institutions, providing education and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. The community is generally positive about Ryan's move to [[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereal]], appreciating his technical competence and his ability to engage with institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

## Community Sentiment and Future Direction

There is a sense of "community angst" regarding the [[Ethereums strategic shift and leadership changes | Ethereum Foundation's strategic direction]], as the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum protocol]] has entered a new environment but its [[Ethereum Foundations new leadership and its goals | leadership]] is still perceived as being in a "peacetime" mindset, requiring more aggressive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

Vitalik Buterin's recent comments suggest a more aggressive scaling roadmap for the layer one, aiming for a 48/72 blob target limit by 2025, which is 2.5 times more aggressive than previous estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This contrasts with the focus on data availability (DA) scaling, as some argue that execution layer scaling (smart contracts, state) is more crucial, especially given competition from other EVM chains and networks like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.

The ongoing conversation highlights the need for [[Ethereums future strategic direction | Ethereum]] to provide a clear commitment to scaling its layer one to keep fees reliably low and maintain user confidence, preventing users from migrating to other, cheaper chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

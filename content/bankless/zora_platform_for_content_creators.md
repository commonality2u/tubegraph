Zora is a platform designed to address the challenge of making online content simultaneously free and valuable. It builds upon Stuart Bran's perspective that information desires to be both [[making_online_content_both_free_and_valuable | free and valuable]], but that the internet has historically lacked effective [[value_capture_mechanisms_for_online_media | value capture mechanisms]] to maximize content's inherent worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Zora's Solution: Tokenization of Content

Zora posits that [[tokenization_in_content_creation | tokenization]], specifically of content, can enable information and media on the internet to be freely engaged with, consumed, and viewed, while simultaneously being extremely valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The platform achieves this by [[benefits_of_tokenizing_media_for_creators | helping creators to tokenize their media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## How Content Creators Use Zora

For a content creator, such as a podcaster, Zora allows them to make their podcast freely available for consumption while making it valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A creator can post an episode of their podcast on Zora, which then transforms into a tradeable coin that individuals can buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Earning Through Engagement

As a podcast episode on Zora gains attention and engagement, its "cryptonative form of engagement" is reflected in its trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Creators can earn rewards directly from this engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These rewards are paid out in both ETH and the specific token associated with the content that was posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This mechanism enables creators to tokenize and monetize their work, capturing value from their media in a novel way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

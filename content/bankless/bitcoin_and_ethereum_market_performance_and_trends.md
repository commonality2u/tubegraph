This week in crypto markets was characterized by a "chaotic" vibe, heavily influenced by external factors like Nvidia's market movements and global politics [00:01:02]. The overall [[Market Trends in Crypto and Ethereum | crypto market trends]] saw a significant impact from these external forces, causing a feeling of being "inside the snow globe" [00:01:10].

## [[Bitcoin and Ether Market Movements and Projections | Bitcoin Performance]]

Bitcoin started the week at $101,000.5 [00:11:01] and concluded it up 3%, reaching $115,000 [00:11:05]. Bitcoin is noted as one of the few cryptocurrencies experiencing significant price appreciation, standing out as an outlier [01:13:24]. Its price is also contributing to the industry's near all-time high total market cap [01:16:31]. Bitcoin's price movements are often linked to larger macro and political narratives [01:12:26].

## [[Ethereum and Bitcoin market updates | Ethereum Performance]]

Ethereum's performance was less stellar compared to Bitcoin. It began the week at $3,200 and ended at $3,250 [01:11:13]. The sentiment indicates that Ethereum is "not doing as great" [01:11:09] and "doing the same thing it's been doing for two years" [01:11:48], with a general observation that it "has been bleeding" [01:13:37].

## Bitcoin-Ether Ratio
The Bitcoin-Ether ratio, an indicator of Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin, briefly dipped below the 0.3 mark to 0.299 [01:11:33] before rising to nearly 0.31 [01:11:29].

## Overall [[Market Trends in Crypto and Ethereum | Crypto Market Trends]] and Sentiment

The broader [[Crypto market trends and analysis | crypto market trends]] are characterized by a sense of disillusionment, despite Bitcoin's high price. This "vibe is so off" [01:13:02] because the advanced decline index of the top 100 cryptocurrencies has been in a downtrend since 2021 [01:13:39]. While Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and Ripple have shown resilience [01:13:41], most other altcoins ("the big middle of the market") have been "bleeding" [01:12:00] and struggling to find their footing [01:12:24].

A key factor contributing to this sentiment is a "general lack of enthusiasm about what's going on in kind of tech crypto outside of Solana" [01:14:11]. It's suggested that people are "tired about promises" [01:15:01] from crypto projects that often don't materialize into real-world utility or widespread adoption [01:15:12]. This has led to a focus on "tokens go up" games [01:16:15] rather than technological advancements.

Despite the prevailing "bad vibes," the total market cap for the industry sits at $3.7 trillion [01:16:21], close to its all-time high [01:16:27], largely buoyed by Bitcoin's performance [01:16:31].

## Influencing Factors

### Nvidia's Market Impact
Nvidia's significant market cap loss of almost $600 billion in a single day (17% off) [00:02:16] was identified as a major external factor affecting the crypto market. This occurred after a Chinese AI lab, DeepSeek, unveiled a strong open-source AI model [00:02:26]. While the market's initial bearish reaction, including a selloff in alts [01:12:02], was seen as an overreaction for the broader [[Economic and market trends affecting cryptocurrency | risk assets]] [01:10:10], it highlighted the influence of external tech and economic news. The long-term impact of cheaper AI development, enabled by open-source models, is considered beneficial for crypto by making AI more accessible and "deflationary" [00:05:54].

### Political Developments
Political events, particularly in the U.S., also heavily influenced market sentiment.
*   **Trump's Executive Order:** The signing of an executive order titled "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology" was initially anticipated by markets [00:26:56]. However, its content, which primarily established a working group and mandated an evaluation of a national digital asset stockpile [00:25:21] rather than direct action, was perceived as "underwhelming" [00:26:50]. This led to a dip in crypto markets [00:26:51], as it effectively "kick[ed] the can down the road" [00:28:02].
*   **Repeal of SAB 121:** The SEC's repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 was hailed as a significant positive development [00:34:40]. SAB 121 had previously made it highly capital-inefficient for banks to custody crypto assets by requiring them to hold offsetting equity [00:34:55]. Its repeal provides a "green light to banks custody crypto" [00:34:30], reducing a major regulatory barrier. This change is expected to primarily impact institutional custody rather than retail banking directly [00:36:19].
*   **Central Bank Adoption Discussions:** Discussions about central banks adding Bitcoin to reserves, such as the Czech Republic considering allocating up to 5% of its reserves [00:29:31], and Norway's Central Bank owning $500 million in MicroStrategy (not direct Bitcoin) [00:29:46], fueled debates about the U.S. establishing its own strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, it's deemed highly unlikely for the U.S. to affirmatively buy Bitcoin for its balance sheet due to political will and congressional control over spending [00:31:12].

### ETF Filings
Bitwise filed for a Dogecoin ETF [01:16:57], which is seen as a logical next step due to Dogecoin's longevity and liquidity [01:17:09]. Additionally, Tuttle Capital filed for 10 different leveraged crypto asset ETFs, including XRP, Solana, and Trumpcoin [01:17:19], indicating a growing interest in diverse crypto investment products. However, the approval timeline for such products, especially Dogecoin, is uncertain, with potential "dragging their feet" from the SEC [01:18:21].

### Meme Coins and Onboarding
The launch of the Trump token (considered a "celeb coin" rather than a "meme coin" due to its direct ownership and control by Trump's team [00:58:07]) was touted as a "mass onboarding event" [00:52:59]. However, data showed less than 1% of new users who acquired it via Moonshot (a platform for debit card purchases) engaged in other on-chain activities [00:53:45]. This suggests it did not effectively onboard new users into the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially burning rather than onboarding [00:56:10] and creating a "bad look for crypto" [00:57:36].

Overall, the [[Crypto market trends and analysis | crypto market trends]] indicate a period of recalibration and patience, with foundational aspects looking positive but requiring time to mature [01:51:52]. The "malays" of the market, characterized by volatility and external influences, is expected to calm down, shifting focus to regulatory clarity from agencies rather than immediate, drastic changes [01:05:10].

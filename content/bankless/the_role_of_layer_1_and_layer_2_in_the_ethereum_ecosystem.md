The conversation around Ethereum's future and its roadmap has evolved, with a renewed focus on the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Ethereum Layer 1]] (L1) while maintaining a [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | rollup-centric roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This shift is seen as a "strategic pivot" for Ethereum, aiming to address its challenges and optimize its value accrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Ethereum's Strategic Pivot: Renewed L1 Focus

Informal researchers and educators, including Zerox Bred and John Charbano, have been active commentators on the evolution of the Ethereum roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Recent discussions, particularly with individuals like Ansgar and Dankrad, have prompted a re-evaluation of Ethereum's future, envisioning a stronger [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The "vibe shift" in the Ethereum community over the past 3-6 months indicates a general acceptance of existing problems and a commitment to fixing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This includes adopting a more product-first mindset and technically improving areas based on reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation (EF) are also seen as a positive step to restart initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

The primary goal of this pivot is to prioritize the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]], which has been identified as a missing piece for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The Ethereum community's "sphere of concern" had become too broad, encompassing [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] and anything touching Ethereum, potentially at the cost of attention to the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The shift aims to make the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] the epicenter of concern for the Ethereum community and culture, which is seen as crucial for a sustainable ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## L1 vs. L2 Dynamics: Competition and Symbiosis

The relationship between the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] and [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] is complex, often debated in terms of value accrual and competition.

### Value Accrual and Token Price
Prioritizing Ethereum's own blockspace and state is believed to drive value back to the Ethereum asset (ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While the [[Ethereums layer 1 L1 and layer 2 L2 scaling strategies | rollup-centric roadmap]] could work, there's skepticism about how abstracted value can become before it negatively impacts the base asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The decline of ETH's price relative to Bitcoin and other market assets signaled a problem that prompted this strategic pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.

### Perceived Competition with L2s
Some [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] have branded themselves as the "home of DeFi" (e.g., Arbitrum, Uni Chain), raising concerns that this comes at the cost of the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. There is a debate about whether this is an "attack on Ethereum" or simply a non-optimal approach to value creation for the broader Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

The idea of a "parasitic" relationship from [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] to L1 is contentious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. It's argued that a [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2]] becomes parasitic when the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] team diverts resources to specifically help the [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2]] and push users to it, rather than prioritizing its own ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. However, a more nuanced view suggests that [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] are both parasitic and symbiotic, taking value but also contributing back to the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

### Symbiotic Relationship and Differentiation
A healthy market outcome for platforms and applications tends towards a symbiotic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. If an [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] provides enough value, applications will naturally attach to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
The increase in [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] capacity will raise the minimum viable bar for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. Generic [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] that only offer slight improvements in speed or cost over the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] may struggle to justify their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] need to uniquely differentiate themselves with features like ultra-low latency for specific applications or consumer-oriented throughput that the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] cannot yet achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Impact of L1 Prioritization on L2s
The expansion of [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] capacity is unlikely to be felt equally across all [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. For example, content coining on Base may not change, and applications fitting on a streaming blockchain like MegaETH might not be impacted by the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]]'s transaction capacity increase from 17 to 70 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. However, other [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] that haven't differentiated themselves could "materially lose out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

This phenomenon is compared to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, where a stronger [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] capacity means the "marginal [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2]] that we didn't really need doesn't can't really justify its existence anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The market is already showing a power law, with dominant chains like Arbitrum and Base becoming even better as the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] improves its settlement layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

The question of whether [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] will need to shut down due to increased L1 competitiveness is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Running a sequencer and maintaining a team costs money, and some [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | Layer 2s]] may find it unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Past examples of wind-downs include the old DYDX version and Aztec, though for different market reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Market Dynamics

### Asset Value and Growth
The market evaluates assets based on their potential to win and grow in a large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. For Ethereum, this means demonstrating continued growth in users and developers on the [[Scaling Ethereum Layer One | Layer 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. The decline of ETH's price relative to Bitcoin might stem from a reduced belief in ETH credibly competing with Bitcoin as a sovereign store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. Instead, Bitcoin is seen as a "special snowflake" for digital gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>, while Ethereum exists within the "smart contract bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. Within this bucket, the probability of Ethereum winning has consistently declined over the past few years, with chains like Solana gaining ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

### Comparison to Bitcoin
Bitcoin and Ethereum's roadmaps have shown similarities, particularly concerning the use of [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>. However, their core problems and objectives differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. Ethereum aims for multi-trillion dollar valuations and tens to hundreds of billions in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>, while Bitcoin primarily focuses on generating sufficient fees to maintain network security as its subsidy goes to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. Bitcoin benefits from inherent user demand for the BTC asset, unlike other tokens that must rely more on technical product superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

### Political and Consumer Impact
The **Role of Ethereum and other chains in DeFi ecosystem** and broader crypto in the political landscape is becoming increasingly intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. Stablecoins are seen as particularly impactful at a direct political level due to their strategic foreign policy and monetary implications, convincing "smart important people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. However, mass public sentiment in the US may not shift until crypto offers more tangible, consumer-facing products beyond memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

Ultimately, crypto needs to ship actual consumer-facing products that people use and understand to improve public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. This will lead to a more positive association, where the average person thinks of practical apps on their phone instead of just "silly meme coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Stablecoins, in particular, serve as excellent "consumer products" that get people on-chain and accustomed to self-custody and wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>.

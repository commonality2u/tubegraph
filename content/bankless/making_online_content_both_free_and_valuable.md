The challenge of [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | content generation and sharing on the internet]] has been to reconcile the desire for information to be both free and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Historically, the internet has lacked the appropriate [[value_capture_mechanisms_for_online_media | value capture mechanisms]] to maximize the value of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Tokenization as a Solution

A proposed solution to this dilemma is [[Tokenization in content creation | tokenization]], particularly of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This approach aims to make information, media, and content on the internet:
*   Free to engage with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Free to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Free to look at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Extremely valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

This is achieved by assisting creators in [[Tokenization in content creation | tokenizing]] their media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Example: The [[Zora platform for content creators | Zora]] Platform

For a [[content_generation_and_sharing_on_the_internet | content creator]], such as a podcaster, this model allows them to make their podcast freely available for consumption while still making it valuable for ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

On a platform like [[Zora platform for content creators | Zora]]:
1.  A creator posts an episode of their podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  The episode becomes a tradeable coin that people can buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  As the podcast episode gains attention and engagement, the cryptonative form of engagement translates into trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  Creators are able to earn rewards from this engagement, paid out in both ETH and the token in which the content was posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This system helps creators to monetize and [[Tokenization in content creation | tokenize]] their work, enabling them to [[value_capture_mechanisms_for_online_media | capture value]] from their media in a radically new way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Worldcoin's US Expansion and Biometric Identity

Worldcoin is expanding its operations in the United States, rolling out its Orb biometric scanning devices in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This move aims to establish a physical presence similar to [[apples_changes_for_crypto_payments | Apple]] retail stores, allowing users to verify their unique human identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### US Rollout and Incentives

Worldcoin is deploying Orbs in six major US cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. These locations will feature "Apple-like in-person stores" where individuals can visit to get their eyeballs scanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

As an incentive, new users who undergo iris scanning will receive 16 World tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Existing users will be granted a "pioneer grant" of 150 World tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. At the time of recording, 150 World tokens were valued at approximately $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

### Partnerships and Ecosystem Expansion

Worldcoin has announced collaborations with major companies, including Visa, Stripe, and Match Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Match Group, which owns dating platforms like Match.com, Hinge, and Tinder, plans to integrate World ID to verify that users are human and not bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

The World App, touted as crypto's most active application, is also seeing significant enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. It will support USDC transactions through Circle, integrate Stripe for payments, and offer access to Kalshi's prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Public Perception and Dystopian Concerns

The concept of Worldcoin, particularly the biometric iris scanning, has often been perceived as dystopian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea of having Sam Altman, a leader in AI, also being behind a company that biometrically scans eyeballs, raises concerns for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

However, the discussion around Worldcoin is shifting, with some acknowledging its potential necessity in an era of proliferating AI bots and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. With AI bots capable of methodically convincing people and making it difficult to distinguish humans from bots online, Worldcoin offers a solution for identity verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

Bloomberg commentator Joe Weisenthal, who covered the tariffs, expressed that Worldcoin is "the only thing in crypto that is really interesting to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

### Security Practices and Necessity

Worldcoin asserts that its security practices are "top-notch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. They claim not to store pictures of users' eyeballs; instead, they generate a hash and discard the original data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. This approach aims to address privacy concerns by focusing on cryptographic proofs rather than personal data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

Some argue that the "dystopian nature of Worldcoin is much more like cosmetic than fundamentals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, especially as people realize the potential negative impacts of unchecked AI proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. The argument posits that such a system could become "civilizationally" necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

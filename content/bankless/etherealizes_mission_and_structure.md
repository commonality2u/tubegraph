Etherealize: Mission and Structure

Etherealize is an organization dedicated to bringing Ethereum to institutions and bridging the traditional financial world with the decentralized [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. It aims to fill a void in the Ethereum space by proactively engaging with external entities, something the "voiceless" and "credibly neutral" Ethereum protocol traditionally did not do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The organization seeks to give Ethereum a "voice in the room" with some of the world's largest institutions, starting with Wall Street and expanding globally to governments and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

Etherealize's mission is to bring the world to Ethereum, asserting that Ethereum is "open for business" and ready for adoption after a decade online without downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. The organization aims for an aggressive onboarding process to bring the world onto Ethereum's upgraded, modular, and scalable platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

**Etherealize's Core Argument for Ethereum's Readiness**
Etherealize emphasizes Ethereum's existing advantages when engaging with institutions:
*   The only blockchain without downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   Most tokenized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   Highest economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   Strongest regulatory presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Highest institutional adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
</div>

### Structure
Etherealize operates as a dual-entity organization, encompassing both for-profit and non-profit components to achieve its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

#### For-Profit Arm
Etherealize is legally structured as a Delaware C Corp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Role**: This side focuses on institutional consulting and product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. It helps institutions understand Ethereum, build products, and transition their assets and user bases onto the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. This includes guiding them through the off-chain and on-chain parts of integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Services**:
    *   Institutional marketing and business development, educating Wall Street institutions about blockchains as a backend for capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
    *   Helping banks and institutions build products to bring their assets and user bases onto Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.
    *   Leveraging an "epic engineering force" to build products for institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
*   **Funding**: Initial funding came from a grant by Vitalik Buterin and the [[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. The long-term funding model relies on client work and fees, creating a sustainable, organic business that fuels the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.

#### Non-Profit Arm
*   **Role**: This section expands Etherealize's scope beyond for-profit activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. It primarily focuses on policy, R&D, and broader marketing and ecosystem support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Goals**: The non-profit aims to ensure laws favor open, neutral, decentralized systems and that learnings from frontline adoption feed back into R&D to evolve the Ethereum stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. It contributes to shaping the roadmap and helps drive necessary upgrades for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

#### Flywheel of Adoption
The combination of the for-profit and non-profit arms creates a "flywheel of adoption" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. As the for-profit side acquires clients and grows, it legitimizes and fuels the non-profit's work in lobbying, policy, and research, leading to more distribution and bigger, better clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. This integrated process aims to ensure global onboarding onto Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

### Team and Leadership
Etherealize was co-founded by VC Raman and Danny Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **VC Raman**: Comes from a decade of Wall Street fixed income trading experience, focusing on deep structural components of the global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. He launched Etherealize in January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Danny Ryan**: Former [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_changes | Ethereum Foundation]] coordinator, known for leading "The Merge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. He brings deep technological and engineering expertise to Etherealize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Other Co-founders**:
    *   **Grant Hummer**: Involved since day one, very close with the [[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]] and Vitalik. He is a vocal and effective advocate for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Zack Obront**: Described as one of the best product engineers and security researchers in the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>. He is crucial for product buildout and engineering needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.

Etherealize's leadership believes they have what it takes to compete with more "sharky" centralized competitors, leveraging Ethereum's inherent strengths of security, decentralization, and high uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. They aim to be "honest, reasonable, buttoned-up players" while being aggressive in onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Target Clients and Success Metrics
Etherealize initially targets Wall Street institutions as a starting point, recognizing it as a subset of the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Client Types**:
    *   **Sell-side banks**: Already familiar with EVM-based internal blockchains and ready to transition to public Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Asset managers**: Players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already using Ethereum for tokenized assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Etherealize helps them tokenize funds to unlock benefits like faster settlement and more access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.
    *   Various other players: Brokerages, mid-market funds, fintech companies, governments, and nation-state economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
*   **Success Metrics**:
    *   More assets tokenized and **utilized** on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
    *   Increased adoption of institutional-scale [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.
    *   Greater awareness of ETH as an asset for security and portfolio diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.
    *   Ultimately, guiding institutions to their "Uniswap moment" where they use the "superpowers of blockchains" like DeFi for permissionless borrowing, lending, and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.

### Relationship with the Ethereum Foundation (EF)
Danny Ryan, having spent nearly eight years at the [[the_relationship_between_etherealize_and_the_ethereum_foundation | Ethereum Foundation]], maintains deep relationships with its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. The EF, including Vitalik, is supportive of Etherealize's work, recognizing the vacuum it fills in business development and institutional engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. While there is a lot of informal communication and relationship ties, especially in the R&D sphere, a formal, ongoing relationship is still under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

Etherealize aligns with the broader [[ethereums_strategic_shift_and_leadership_changes | Ethereum Foundation leadership changes]] and [[ethereum_foundations_new_leadership_and_its_goals | Ethereum's future strategic direction]], which indicates a move towards a new era of greater aggressiveness and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. This shift, with new co-executive directors like Tomas and Shiae Shia, allows the EF to be more opinionated and act as a counterbalancing force against powerful external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>. Etherealize complements this by filling the gap between the EF's historical role and the need for direct, proactive engagement with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

### Roadblocks and Challenges
Initially, the biggest hurdle for institutional adoption was regulatory uncertainty, which is now clearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>. Etherealize's role is to handhold institutions through this process, providing an "open line of communication" and helping them with everything from tokenizing assets to deploying applications and [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

Longer-term challenges for Ethereum's [[role_and_scope_of_the_ethereum_foundation | role and scope]] include:
*   **Scale and Efficiency**: The need for greater scale and efficiency at [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 1]] and [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2]] to meet the demands of global adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:15:00">[54:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Standards**: Managing the complexity of [[the_importance_of_ethereums_layer_1_and_layer_2_dynamics | Layer 2]]s and users interacting across different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a>.
*   **Privacy Model Evolution**: Adapting the privacy model in the application layer to accommodate institutions and global consumers, potentially through tools like Noir and improved wallet standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:12:00">[55:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:23:00">[55:23:00]</a>.

Etherealize aims to use the current "window" of regulatory clarity and institutional readiness to onboard real-world assets onto Ethereum, ensuring that the network becomes deeply integrated into the fabric of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48:00">[46:48:00]</a>. This strategic move is intended to make the shift to blockchains irreversible, regardless of future political or regulatory swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**How the Ethereum Community Can Support Etherealize**
The Etherealize team encourages the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] to:
*   Bring opportunities and potential projects that should be within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:00">[51:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:59:00">[51:59:00]</a>.
*   Identify and fill "vacuums" or unmet needs within the broader ecosystem, whether in application incubation, identity solutions, or other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>.
*   Proactively address gaps in meeting the world where it is, beyond just building technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:48:00">[53:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>.
</div>

Etherealize is actively hiring to build "the best team," seeking talent in engineering, R&D, business development, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. The goal is to bring together the best of Ethereum and Wall Street to make the financial system an Ethereum system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

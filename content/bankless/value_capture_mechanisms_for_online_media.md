The internet has historically lacked appropriate value capture mechanisms for content, hindering information from being as valuable as it could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This contrasts with the belief that information desires to be both free and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Tokenization as a Solution

[[tokenization_in_content_creation | Tokenization]], particularly of content, is proposed as a method to address this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The aim is to make information, media, and content on the internet free to engage with, consume, and view, while simultaneously making it extremely valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This approach helps creators to [[benefits_of_tokenizing_media_for_creators | tokenize their media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### How Tokenization Works for Creators

For content creators, such as podcasters, [[tokenization_in_content_creation | tokenization]] allows content to be freely available for consumption but valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

An example of this mechanism is through platforms like [[zora_platform_for_content_creators | Zora]]:
*   A creator can post an episode of their podcast on [[zora_platform_for_content_creators | Zora]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   This content then becomes a tradeable coin that people can buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   As the podcast episode gains attention and engagement, its cryptonative form of engagement is effectively measured by trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Creators can earn rewards from this engagement, which are paid out in both ETH and the specific token used for the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This system enables creators to monetize and [[tokenization_in_content_creation | tokenize]] their work, allowing them to capture value from their media in a new and radical way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The goal is to facilitate [[making_online_content_both_free_and_valuable | making online content both free and valuable]] simultaneously.

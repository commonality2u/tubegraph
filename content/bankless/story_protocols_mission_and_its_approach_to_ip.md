From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Story Protocol is a new blockchain aiming to [[tokenization_of_intellectual_property_ip_on_blockchain | tokenize the world's intellectual property (IP)]] and place it on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its broader vision extends beyond tokenizing existing IP; it seeks to unlock future potential for IP and content, enabling a new era of human creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Story Protocol aspires to become the IP layer for the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Problem with Traditional Intellectual Property

Traditionally, IP is deeply rooted in nation-state legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This presents a challenge for blockchain technology, which is designed to operate at a layer higher than nation states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### IP as an Asset Class
Intellectual property encompasses creative works like songs, characters, and movies (copyright), major brands (trademarks), and new inventions or processes (patents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It is a multi-trillion dollar asset class, estimated by the World Intellectual Property Organization to be around $70 trillion in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Despite its immense value, IP is largely inaccessible to the average person, with only sophisticated entities like Hollywood studios and their lawyers able to engage with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

> [!WARNING] High Friction and Cost
> Simple IP transactions are prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For example, creating a licensed Darth Vader lunchbox would require hiring lawyers (costing upwards of $10,000), contacting Disney's licensing team, negotiating terms, and undergoing audits for revenue payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This process makes even the simplest use of IP extremely costly and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
>
> In traditional markets, lawyers have been a constant intermediary layer in market technology, unlike other market evolutions that eliminate such layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Story Protocol aims to disrupt this "lawyer layer" by using software as a better intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

### The Fuzzy Nature of IP
Unlike discrete units in traditional finance (like shares or dollars), IP often has "fuzzy edges," where the boundaries of what constitutes an IP are determined on an as-needed basis by lawyers in a courtroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This subjectivity is a significant challenge.

## Story Protocol's Solution: Tokenizing IP on Blockchain
Story Protocol's core thesis is that blockchains can create unstoppable digital markets for new types of assets by coordinating ownership at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It adopts a "stablecoin approach" to IP, similar to how stablecoins extend the utility of the US dollar by putting it on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. By bringing the antiquated, pen-and-paper IP system on-chain, Story Protocol makes it programmable and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

### How it Works
Story Protocol aims to be a decentralized IP system, functioning like a payments network for IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

> [!INFO] Two-Sided Marketplace
> *   **Supply Side (Creators/IP Holders):** Register IP as "atomic assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. They can set licensing terms (e.g., upfront fees, revenue share) directly on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
> *   **Demand Side (Applications/Partners):** License IP from Story Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. They can access IP and stream revenues on-chain, avoiding lawsuits and complex negotiations through a single API call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Legal Framework and Attestation Service
Story Protocol invests in both technology and a legal framework called the "programmable IP license" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This framework ensures that terms set on-chain are reflected in a real legal contract, providing a legal backstop if issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

A key feature is the "Story Attestation Service," a custom architecture that decentralizes the process of checking for IP infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Every new asset uploaded to Story is checked against existing IP to identify potential infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This service provides on-chain attestations if an asset looks similar to common IPs (e.g., Dua Lipa songs, Mickey Mouse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. [[Role of AI and blockchain in transforming IP markets | AI plays a significant role]] in filtering out 99.9% of edge cases that would typically require manual review, although AI cannot make the final legal call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Purpose-Built Blockchain Architecture
Story Protocol operates as a purpose-built chain, not a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. While general-purpose blockchains exist, Story's thesis is that block space should be specialized, similar to the evolution of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

It explored building on a Layer 2 but faced issues such as the cost of flowing royalties up a complex IP graph and the need for validators to run the attestation service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. By owning its fate as customized block space, Story Protocol aims to optimize for specific IP-related challenges without competing with other chains like Ethereum or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. Story Protocol functions as an "IP microservice," allowing Web2 and Web3 applications to plug in via an API, similar to how Stripe handles payments or AWS hosts data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Tokenizing IP: Process and Go-to-Market

### The Process
Users can upload IP by dragging and dropping files into Story's first-party app, "The Portal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. They can set detailed licensing terms manually or use presets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. This registers the IP in a standardized global IP repository, and the terms are recorded on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. A real legal license is generated for purchasers, who can mint a license token to create a secondary market for rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Go-to-Market Strategy
Story Protocol's go-to-market strategy begins with bootstrapping the supply side by bringing high-quality IP on-chain to attract demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Music Industry:** Through ecosystem app Arya, Story Protocol has onboarded rights and revenue for songs by artists like Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, and BTS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Hollywood:** Collaborating with creators like David Guyer (known for *The Dark Knight* trilogy), who is building a new sci-fi universe on Story where characters and assets are registered as atomic IPs, allowing community remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

The long-term goal is to enable the creation of new types of IP that are "built to be decentralized" and "built upon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. This aims to foster an environment where creators can leverage the infrastructure to their advantage, similar to how YouTubers revolutionized content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

## Addressing Skepticism: IP and the Nation-State
A primary critique is that IP is inherently a nation-state construct, while blockchains aim to exist above nation-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Story Protocol's approach is seen by some as extending traditional capabilities rather than embodying a "cypherpunk ethos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

### The "Stablecoin Approach" Analogy
Story Protocol defends its approach by drawing an analogy to stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Stablecoins, while rooted in fiat currencies (e.g., USDC), have achieved significant product-market fit and enable the broader adoption of crypto, even for those who don't care about the underlying ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This "ladder" allows people to gradually engage with crypto, eventually leading to the use of independent currencies like ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Story Protocol similarly aims to extend existing copyright law by making it more efficient on-chain, which in turn facilitates the long-term vision of "code being law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

### Enforcement and Legibility
While Story Protocol does not guarantee perfect enforcement of all IP (which would require a surveillance state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, it significantly improves upon the status quo for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>:
1.  **Declaration of Rights:** Story makes it easy to declare rights and provide attribution, which strengthens a creator's claim in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. US copyright law, for example, awards more damages if IP is registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.
2.  **Infringement Detection:** The Story Attestation Service helps detect when IP might be misused, providing visibility to creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to make the process 10x cheaper and easier to get to the point of enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Story Protocol is actively working to integrate its registration process with governmental copyright offices, such as the US Copyright Office and the World Intellectual Property Organization, aiming for formal legal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

### Global Harmonization of Copyright
Story Protocol initially focuses on copyright because it is broadly global due to historical harmonization efforts like the Berne Convention of 1886 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. While enforcement still differs by nation, the principles of copyright law are largely similar, enabling a more global and borderless IP transaction system, akin to stablecoins for value transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Story Protocol aims to be a middleware or settlement layer for IP, facilitating exchange between various entities, including potentially nation-states themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Credible Neutrality and Token Utility

### Credible Neutrality
Story Protocol, as a venture-backed startup, addresses concerns about its credible neutrality compared to systems like Visa or SWIFT, which originated as bank conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. It argues that its technology is decentralized, with the development company running only one validator among many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. It points to examples like Android or Anthropic's model context protocol, where private entities developed protocols that became widely adopted and open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. The success case for Story is to become a "boring" and universal backbone like the domain name system, where its corporate entity status becomes less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### IP Token Utility
The native IP token serves traditional blockchain functions like network security, gas for transactions, and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. Additionally, while users can pay for licenses using stablecoins or even fiat, all revenue is converted to IP tokens on the back end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. This means the IP token acts as a bearer of demand for all IP transactions on the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

## Philosophical Justification: Incentivizing Creativity in the Age of AI
Story Protocol views [[Role of AI and blockchain in transforming IP markets | AI as a huge force for good]] and considers itself an AI optimist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. While acknowledging that traditional IP systems are outdated in the age of AI, Story Protocol emphasizes the importance of property rights for creators to incentivize meaningful creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Second-Order Implication of Abundance
> If AI leads to an age of abundant content (e.g., 8 billion people creating thousands of Hollywood-level videos daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>, the idea of IP becomes *more* important, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. The first-order consequence is abundant content, but the second-order consequence is that truly novel and inspiring original ideas become more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Without incentives for new creation, the "oil" of original content will run out, ultimately harming [[AI Agents and Model Developments | AI progress itself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. Story Protocol seeks to define how to make property rights digital and scalable with the internet to ensure continued innovation and human creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

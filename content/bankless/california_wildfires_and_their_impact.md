Recent [[California wildfires and their impact | California wildfires]] have caused significant devastation, particularly in the Los Angeles area, highlighting the vulnerability of physical assets, including cryptocurrency private keys, to natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Devastation in Malibu and Greater LA
Images and videos from the wildfires show widespread destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As of January 8th, Malibu was heavily affected, with scenes of houses on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The Palisades fire in Northwest LA, a forested area, was also active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Malibu is the next city over from LA, close to Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The fires, fueled by forested hills surrounding LA, encroached from the west and north, transforming from forest fires into "waves of houses" on fire as they intersected with neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Personal Impact and Crypto Vulnerability
The fires brought to light the risks of relying solely on physical security for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. A tweet from "Monty" detailed the loss suffered by their 70-year-old aunt, who lost her apartment and most of her savings in crypto because she lost her wallet and seed phrase without any backups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This incident serves as a public service announcement (PSA) for the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

> "imagine having a bear asset being your own bank having a cryptocurrency in a house that uh you are out of and your loved ones are out of fortunately but um you didn't get your private Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

## Secure Management of Cryptocurrency
The incident underscores the challenges of managing cryptocurrency during disasters. It is generally advised not to keep private keys solely where one lives, as a house is not a permanent structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Recommendations for securing crypto assets include:
*   Storing at least one copy of private keys in a location separate from one's residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Splitting the seed phrase using Shamir secret sharing and storing shards at multiple locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Utilizing safe deposit boxes at banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Employing multi-signature wallets (multisig) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Using smart account wallets, which allow for multiple signers, such as a lawyer or loved one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Custodying crypto assets requires a higher level of due diligence, and events like the wildfires demonstrate why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

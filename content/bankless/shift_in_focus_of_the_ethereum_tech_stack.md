A significant [[innovations_and_product_mindset_adoption_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | shift in focus]] is occurring within the Ethereum technology stack, moving towards becoming a strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_its_implications | strategic pivot]] is observed to have a positive feedback effect on Ether as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Ether as a Commodity Asset
Ether is increasingly seen as a commodity asset with a commodity-like shelling point and focus, serving as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This perception is bolstered by Ethereum's strength as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Higher fees and increased burn mechanisms within Ethereum are anticipated to further boost the strength of Ether as a commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dual Mindset for the Ecosystem
The Ethereum community faces the complex challenge of adopting a dual mindset:
*   **Technology Side (Product Focus):** On the technology side of Ethereum, there is a need for "convexity," likened to Vitalik Buterin's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. When discussing Ethereum as a product, the community is encouraged to be adaptable, flexible, nice, and open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This approach is crucial when engaging with application builders who are selecting a platform for their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Ether as an Asset (Maximalist Focus):** Conversely, when discussing Ether as an asset, the approach shifts to "concavity," requiring an extreme and maximalist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This involves being strong and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This maximalist attitude is appropriate when communicating with entities like Wall Street about Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The challenge for the ecosystem is to navigate both these "lanes" simultaneously, adapting the contextual approach as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This dual requirement is acknowledged as both scary and daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

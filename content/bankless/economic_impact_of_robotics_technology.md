The advent of robotics technology is poised to have a transformative economic impact, drawing parallels to the industry-defining success of the iPhone. Just as Apple's market capitalization grew from $70 billion in 2006 to $4 trillion by creating an entirely new industry on top of the existing economy, robotics is expected to redefine productive output and market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Expanding the Workforce and Productivity

The productive output of an economy can be understood as the productivity per [[role_of_robotics_in_the_future_workforce | workforce]] multiplied by the size of the [[role_of_robotics_in_the_future_workforce | workforce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Robotics is set to exponentially expand the [[role_of_robotics_in_the_future_workforce | workforce]] number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Productivity Shift
> Robots are significantly cheaper and more productive than human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This cost efficiency will make it challenging for companies to justify retaining human employees when a robot costs substantially less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This shift creates a "forcing function" where robots are preferred due to their superior performance, lower cost, and higher productive output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Decreased Cost of Goods

A major economic benefit of widespread robotics adoption will be the reduction in the cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This is because the actual cost of employment, when replaced by robotics, is significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Future Market Valuation

The perceived limit of market valuation, currently exemplified by Apple's $4 trillion market cap, is expected to be aggressively surpassed by a robotics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This prediction is based on the ability of robotics to replace and multiply the output of the [[role_of_robotics_in_the_future_workforce | human workforce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Furthermore, robots can be produced much faster than new working humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

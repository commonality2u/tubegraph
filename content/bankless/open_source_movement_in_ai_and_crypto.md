The creators of Zerobro are philosophically aligned with the [[Open Source AI Development | open-source movement]], not only for crypto rails, but also for AI [00:02:23]. It is argued that aligning open source with AI is even more crucial now, given the rapid progress in [[Open Source AI Models | open AI models]] and agents from traditional AI companies [00:02:35].

## The Role of Crypto in Open Source AI

The crypto industry is viewed as providing the necessary "guardrails" for [[Major players and projects in crypto AI | AI agents]] because it is an open, pure, and permissionless system [00:09:38]. This enables AI to flourish economically, as it was built to be permissionless, unlike the existing Web2 world [00:10:15]. The focus on a permissionless and open market has been a passion for those with a crypto background [00:10:20].

This combination of crypto and AI offers a new paradigm shift in economic activity, where AI agents are expected to perform most actions [00:08:54]. The financial aspects of the crypto industry, such as LP fees, allow startups to bootstrap funding and contribute to the core technology of the AI industry, rather than relying on traditional funding rounds [01:05:31].

## [[Open Source AI Models | Open Source AI Models]] and Frameworks

Zerobro's vision includes building and releasing [[Open Source AI Models | AI models]] for other developers to use [00:01:06]. The team is currently working to build in-house models for Zerobro that will be made public via an API [00:26:05]. While the end goal is to have models built from scratch, they are currently fine-tuning existing [[Open Source AI Models | open-source models]] like Llama 3.3 for best performance [00:30:03]. Previously, they also used GPT models, which were challenging to jailbreak but showed good performance once done [00:30:15]. The full transition to local models with all weights in-house is underway [00:30:29].

### Zerai: The Open Source Framework

Zerai is Zerobro's [[Open Source AI Development | open-source framework]] [00:31:31]. It allows users to download code and set up a configuration file that defines an agent's personality and name [00:32:01]. Users can select actions for their agents, such as posting on Twitter or Farcaster [00:32:07]. The framework is continuously being expanded with more connectors and adapters for complex and diverse actions, including blockchain operations like trading, Pump.fun actions, and staking [00:32:15]. Zerai is intended to be the "skeleton and the engine" for these agents [00:39:55].

### Zentience: The No-Code Platform

Zentience is a no-code platform that launches agents from the Zerai framework [00:32:41]. It automates processes like social media account extraction, simplifying the setup for users [00:32:46]. Zentience is designed to be the home where Zerai agents live and communicate with each other, forming an ecosystem [00:32:57]. This platform aims to remove the technical barrier of command-line instructions, making agent creation and operation accessible to a wider audience, similar to how Apple popularized graphical user interfaces [00:40:07]. Users will be able to control their agents through an LLM interface, using natural language to initiate on-chain actions like swaps [00:41:01].

## Benefits of the Open Source Approach

The [[Importance of Open Source in AI Development | open-source approach]] for AI is considered a better strategy for several reasons:

*   **Democratization of Technology**: It prevents a technological or economic gap in humanity caused by AI access, similar to the disparity seen with internet access [00:55:36]. [[Open Source AI Development | Open source]] ensures broader access to this technology [00:55:52].
*   **Mitigating Bad Actors**: While bad actors might still gain access to open-source technology, a world where everyone uses open frameworks like Zerai and Eliza is more prepared [00:56:17]. The public would be able to identify misaligned agents and develop tools to mitigate damage, as they would be familiar with the technology [00:56:39].
*   **Community Contribution**: An [[Open Source AI Development | open-source framework]] like Zerai leverages builders as contributors, expanding its capabilities [00:57:14]. When a builder expands their agent and contributes back to Zerai, future builders benefit from that contribution, creating a "nice flywheel" [00:57:23].
*   **Compatibility**: Python, the main language for AI and machine learning, has a vast ecosystem of libraries and resources (e.g., PyTorch) that can be easily integrated into Zerai [00:57:52]. This makes Zerai an "AI first" framework that is compatible with existing AI tooling and infrastructure [00:58:22].

## Future of Open Source AI and Crypto

The current market is seen as a redefinition of the [[Open Source AI vs Silicon Valley | Silicon Valley]] startup process, with crypto acting as the financial medium and AI as the motivator [01:06:11]. The goal is to build something substantial that will persist and gain value even after market hype subsides [01:05:47]. There is potential for [[Open Source AI vs Silicon Valley | web2 companies]] to adapt this model and for partnerships between web2 AI entities and crypto companies to leverage each other's technology [01:08:30]. This could lead to a broad mainstream acceptance of AI agents, with integrations into everyday life, such as Apple Intelligence AI agents handling Apple Pay and emails [01:01:13]. The [[Emerging Trends in AI and Crypto | emerging trend]] of "edge models" becoming smaller and more efficient will allow LLMs to run locally on personal devices, further democratizing access to AI technology [01:01:28].

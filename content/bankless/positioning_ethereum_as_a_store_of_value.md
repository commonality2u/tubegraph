From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax, proposes a distinct path for the conversation around Ethereum (ETH) as an asset, advocating for its exclusive positioning as a store of value commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He argues that focusing on discounted cash flow (DCF) models for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] is detrimental and should cease immediately, as it contributes to [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | ETH's price]] decline relative to the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Two Fundamental Valuation Frameworks

Kasmanian identifies two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:

1.  **Fundamentals View (DCF / Equity-like)**: In this model, the asset represents a claim on some form of future cash flows, produced by smart contracts or human effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is akin to valuing equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View**: Here, the asset does not represent a claim on cash flows. Its value is demand-based, like gold, used for industrial applications or as a [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This valuation is deterministic, based on supply and demand, rather than future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Separating Ethereum Technology from the ETH Asset

A crucial distinction in Kasmanian's thesis is the separation of [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] the technology from [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While he holds a strong belief in [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum's technology]] and its developers, he emphasizes that the success of the technology does not automatically correlate with an increase in [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | ETH's price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

> "The Ethereum Foundation, the researchers, they're brilliant. And actually, I think I would say this from the very beginning 2014 to currently in 2025. They're probably the smartest people in the space in terms of what Vitalik has created, how he's created the technology, what ethos Ethereum has actually created in the ability of people to do in the world... that does not mean the Ethereum price is going to go up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## The Socially Constructed Nature of Asset Definition

Kasmanian asserts that the definition of [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] as an asset is a socially constructed phenomenon, similar to defining a head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This is not merely a marketing exercise but a fundamental redefinition that causally impacts what the asset is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. A lack of unified social consensus on [[importance_of_defining_core_values_for_ethereum | ETH's core values]] can lead to confusion and a "schizophrenic" valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Impact of EIP-1559 and Proof of Stake on ETH's Narrative

Kasmanian attributes the shift in [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]]'s asset definition, and potentially its underperformance against Bitcoin, to the transition to Proof of Stake and the implementation of EIP-1559 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. While he supports these technological advancements, he believes they inadvertently led the community to focus on [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]]'s cash flows (fees burned or distributed to validators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### The "Floor Price" Problem

By emphasizing fees and burn mechanisms, the community has, perhaps unintentionally, focused on [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]]'s "floor price" or minimum value, derived from its industrial use case (blockspace demand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

> "When we entirely focus on that, what we're basically saying is, hey guys, ETH could be worth many many many times more if we concentrated on different social definition. But let's all sit down and non-stop talk about the floor, right? Like like the actual floor of Ethereum. Target the minimum valuation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

This focus on a DCF model could lead to an [[irrational_confidence_in_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] valuation as low as $500-$600, even if the technology remains functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. This is contrasted with Bitcoin, whose Proof of Work mechanism, despite its costs, inherently forces a focus on its commodity nature rather than cash flows, preventing a similar "pitfall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### Comparison with Gold

Kasmanian draws an analogy with gold: its industrial use (e.g., in electronics) represents a floor price, but its substantial value comes from its [[role_of_ethereum_as_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. If the community only focused on gold's industrial demand, its price would be significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Similarly, [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH's]] burning mechanism through EIP-1559 is an industrial use case that sets a floor, but it shouldn't be the primary valuation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## The Need for a Unified Narrative

Kasmanian strongly aligns with Ryan's "blue money religion" concept, which advocates for a fervent, maximalist community around [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] the asset, similar to how the Bitcoin community treats BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

> "If we don't make sure that Ethereum is used as store of value and two if we don't make sure that Ethereum the technology right the the settlement layer is not this fundamental ledger we've we've we've lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

He contends that this unified social agreement is vital, even if it requires a more "dictatorial" approach to defining [[importance_of_defining_core_values_for_ethereum | ETH's core values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Without a clear, agreed-upon definition, the discourse around [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] remains chaotic, hindering its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

### Balancing Technology and Asset Narratives

The challenge for the Ethereum community lies in maintaining a flexible, pluralistic, and product-minded approach for the [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum technology]] while adopting a rigid, maximalist, and unforgiving stance for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

## Ethereum's Competitive Position and Future Potential

Kasmanian believes that the current focus on DCF for [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] is detrimental to its [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | competitive position against Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. He predicts a future where, if this trend continues, [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] at $20,000 would still represent a new all-time low against Bitcoin at $2 million, because the value capture of [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum's technology]] will predominantly benefit Bitcoin as the supreme [[role_of_cryptocurrencies_as_money_and_store_of_value | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

He emphasizes that [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] should be regarded as a "digital commodity," and its emission algorithm should be treated as immutably as Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap, even if it doesn't need to be a fixed total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. This clarity would enable easier reasoning about [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH's]] supply dynamics, fostering its narrative as a commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.

Kasmanian remains bullish on [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] the asset, believing these issues are "addressable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. He argues that [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | ETH]] was originally intended to be a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] commodity and can return to that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

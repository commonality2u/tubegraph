From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

[[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | Robinhood]] currently operates as a "bankless" entity, meaning it does not possess a banking charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Current Status: Operating Without a Banking Charter

Despite not having a charter, [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | Robinhood]] functions as a neutral platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While obtaining a banking charter offers benefits such as plugging into the Fed wire system and the ability to lend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | Robinhood]] instead utilizes [[partnerships_between_robinhood_and_banks | partnerships with banks]] to fulfill its banking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Role of Partnerships and Traditional Banking

Even large crypto and DeFi protocols necessitate [[role_of_banks_in_the_crypto_and_defi_space | banking relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Banks are an integral part of the process for converting fiat currency into on-chain assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Crypto Banks and Convergence

There is an expectation that, with clearer regulatory frameworks, [[possibility_of_future_crypto_banks | crypto banks]] will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These entities would likely possess a specific form of licensure with potentially fewer restrictions compared to an OCC national banking charter, while still governing treasury management and reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The future is anticipated to see a [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | convergence]] rather than a divergence between the traditional banking system and the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | convergence]] implies that beneficial aspects of traditional banking should be integrated into crypto, and valuable elements of crypto technology should be incorporated into banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The overall aim is to foster a level playing field and competition across markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

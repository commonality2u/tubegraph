The second week of February 2024 saw significant developments and diverse sentiment across the cryptocurrency space, characterized by market dispersion and conflicting signals [00:00:30].

## Overall Market Sentiment

The current sentiment in crypto is described as split, with dispersion being a key characteristic of recent cycles [00:00:31]. Unlike previous cycles, there are now clear winners and losers among various cryptocurrencies [00:00:47]. This dispersion is seen as a healthy sign, indicating that capital is being allocated based on performance rather than just risk, moving away from a strong beta correlation where [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] runs first, followed by [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]], and then other altcoins [00:01:51]. The market is growing so large that it is becoming increasingly dispersed [00:01:30].

## Monday Market Sell-off and Tariffs

On Monday, the markets experienced multi-billion dollar liquidations following former President Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China [00:04:02]. This led to an initial fear of a trade war, causing over $2 billion in crypto market liquidations and a total crypto market cap drop of approximately $600 billion [00:04:22]. However, the situation quickly de-escalated when Canada and Mexico conceded, and Trump paused the tariffs for 30 days, leading to a quick rebound in traditional and crypto markets [00:04:13]. The event highlighted the market's sensitivity to external [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | economic and market trends affecting cryptocurrency]] and unpredictable political posturing [00:05:09].

## Cryptocurrency Price Performance

### Bitcoin (BTC)
[[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] was down 7.5% on the week, starting at $115,000 and ending at $97,100 [00:07:47]. Despite the initial sell-off, Bitcoin quickly rebounded above $100,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday, demonstrating its relative strength [00:08:48].

### Ethereum (ETH)
[[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | Ethereum]] saw a more significant decline, starting the week at $3,260 and falling 16% to $2,720 [00:08:02]. At one point, it wicked down to around $2,200 on some centralized exchanges [00:08:18]. This deeper drop was attributed to heavy shorting of [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | Ethereum]] during the sell-off, and unlike Bitcoin, [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | ETH]] did not rebound as strongly [00:08:36].

### [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | ETH/BTC Ratio]]
The [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | ETH/BTC ratio]] hit lows not seen since January 2021 [00:09:04], effectively erasing all gains made by [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]] against [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] during the 2021 bull market [00:09:15]. This fall in the ratio is seen as an acceleration of an ongoing trend [00:10:45].

## ETF Inflows

Despite the market volatility, both [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs]] experienced strong inflows [00:11:24]. The [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum ETF]] recorded $300 million in inflows on February 4th alone, and nearly $500 million over five days [00:11:27]. [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin ETFs]] also saw strong performance with approximately $1 billion in inflows over seven days [00:11:44].

## [[crypto_market_trends_and_token_movements | Losers of the Week]]

Several tokens experienced significant declines:
*   Athena: Down 35% [00:12:01].
*   Official TrumpCoin (Melania Coin): Also down 35% and described as an "absolute stinker" since its launch [00:12:03]. The launch of Melania Coin is believed to have "destroyed tens of billions of dollars of capital" by eroding confidence in other Trump-related meme coins [00:15:11].
*   Celestia (Tia): Down 32% on the week, erasing most of its gains since its November 2023 launch, falling from a peak of $20 to below $3 [00:12:14]. Despite the drop, some believe Tia is a good long-term punt due to its focus on single slot finality and larger data blocks, positioning it as a competitor to [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | Ethereum]] in some aspects [00:12:42].

## MicroStrategy's Impact on Bitcoin

MicroStrategy officially rebranded to "Strategy," integrating the [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] logo into its name, signaling its formal commitment to [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] [00:18:11]. The company's Q4 2024 results revealed a significant acquisition of $20 billion in [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]], nearly doubling their holdings to $44 billion [00:18:35]. This aggressive buying is believed to be a major factor behind [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin's]] recent strength and outperformance [00:10:06]. The company also introduced new KPIs: "BTC gain" (Bitcoin acquired over a period) and "dollar amount gain" [00:20:21].

This strategy has inspired other companies, such as "Similar Scientific," a healthcare tech company, to adopt a similar approach, publicly announcing their [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] purchases and holding strategies, which is seen as creating a "herd" or "stampede" towards [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] [00:23:33].

## [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum Scaling and Supply Dynamics]]

### Gas Limit Increase
[[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum's]] gas limit, which determines the size of layer one blocks, has increased to over 32 million gas for the first time [00:59:00]. This increase is a result of layer one validators voting on block size, a crowd-sourced mechanism [00:58:21]. This move towards [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | layer one scaling]] has been celebrated by prominent figures like Vitalik Buterin, who emphasized supporting [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | layer one scaling]] under the constraint of decentralization [00:58:50]. There's a push for further increases, with some advocating for a 45 million gas limit [00:59:02].

### Pectra Upgrade and Blobs
The upcoming Pectra upgrade for [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum]], scheduled for mid-March, is one of the largest upgrades in terms of included EIPs and features [00:59:15]. A key feature of Pectra will be the doubling of blob count from 3 to 6 as a target, and from 6 to 9 as a maximum, which is significant for [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | layer two scaling]] [01:00:31].

### Ethereum Supply Inflation
A significant discussion point is [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | Ethereum's]] recent return to net inflation [01:02:06]. Since the introduction of blobs (EIP 4844) around April 2024, and the shift of scale to [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Layer 2s]], the [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | ETH supply has been inflating]] [01:01:47]. The supply has been net inflationary since the introduction of Proof of Stake in September 2022 [01:02:10]. While [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | Ethereum]] aggressively burned nearly half a million ETH after EIP 1559 and the Merge, it has since reissued over half a million ETH, leading to a net inflationary rate of 0.0001% over a two-year, 145-day period [01:02:25].

This situation challenges the "ultrasound money" meme associated with [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | Ethereum]] [01:03:05]. While [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin's]] monetary policy is seen as superior due to its predictability, the debate shifts from just deflationary status to understanding and predictability of monetary policy [01:03:47]. The focus for [[future_trends_in_blockchain_and_cryptocurrency_ecosystems | Ethereum]] should be on scaling transactions and blobs to bring it back to a deflationary state, making the L1 more usable, and focusing on what users want rather than solely on "moneyness" [01:04:59].

Washington D.C. has expressed a sudden interest in a $2 trillion [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact|stablecoin]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## US Regulatory Outlook and Market Projections

The Secretary of Treasury, Scott Bessant, has stated that the United States aims to be the premier destination for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. He believes that good market structure will ensure US best practices are adopted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. Digital assets are seen as an important source of innovation that can drive the use of the US dollar worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

### $2 Trillion Demand for Stablecoins
Speculation suggests there could be up to $2 trillion in demand for US government securities from digital assets over the next few years, especially with appropriate [[stablecoin_regulation_in_the_us|stablecoin legislation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This represents a significant shift from previous Treasury perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

## Key Legislative Efforts

Currently, there are two main legislative efforts concerning stablecoins:
*   **The Stable Act**: Introduced in the House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   **The Genius Act**: Introduced in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. The Genius Act is considered more significant due to the Senate's role and its higher chance of passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. If it passes the Senate with 60 votes, the US will have actual [[stablecoin_regulation_in_the_us|stablecoin legislation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

Nine Democrats, initially presumed to support the Genius Act, have reportedly developed cold feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. They have cited concerns regarding anti-money laundering (AML), national security, and anti-terrorism/anti-child trafficking measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Senator Bill Hagerty, a co-author of the bill, is urging Democrats to move forward to prevent Republicans from dominating the digital asset issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

## Industry Initiatives

### Tether's US-Centric Stablecoin
Tether is reportedly planning to launch a US version of [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact|USCT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, stated that a domestic stablecoin would differ from their international one and would depend on the timeline of final legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

### Coinbase and the 402 Protocol
Coinbase is reviving the 402 payments protocol, an open-source standard built on HTTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. The 402 error code, originally a "payment required" standard from Tim Berners-Lee's 1992 drafts, was never fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. This protocol aims to facilitate microtransactions for services, such as AI chatbots paying for external data sources using [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact|stablecoins]] settled on Base, which then settles to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This could enable [[infrastructure_required_for_stablecoin_payments|AI bots to pay their fair share]] to content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

### Stripe's Global Stablecoin Accounts
Stripe has launched new money management capabilities, offering [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact|stablecoin]]-powered financial accounts in 101 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. All Stripe accounts now have a [[stable_coins_and_their_market_impact|stablecoin]] account option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

This week's economic discussions highlight a continued tension between former President [[donald_trumps_administrations_economic_policies | Donald Trump]] and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

## Federal Reserve Holds Steady on Interest Rates

Hopes for more Federal Reserve rate cuts were dashed as Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the desired inflation data was "not quite there yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Powell signaled that no further rate cuts are expected in 2025 due to higher-than-expected inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Inflation rose 0.5% month-over-month, reaching 3% year-over-year, slightly above the forecast of 2.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Powell testified before Congress, emphasizing that the Fed is "in no rush to cut interest rates" because the economy remains strong and inflation elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Stance and Economic Policy

[[donald_trumps_administrations_economic_policies | Donald Trump]] reacted negatively to the Fed's stance, tweeting on Truth Social: "Interest rates should be lowered, something which should go hand in hand with upcoming tariffs. Let's rock and roll America, America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This mirrors his actions during his last administration eight years ago, where he frequently urged Powell to pursue a more accommodative monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Tun Chetra, a guest on the show, noted that many of [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact_on_the_us_economy | Trump's policies]] are inherently pro-inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For example, tariffs make imported goods more expensive, even if cheaper to produce elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Therefore, his [[trumps_economic_policies_and_their_impact_on_the_us_economy | economic policy relies]] on low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Chetra speculated that the "overheating" of markets post-election might calm down, leading to a relaxation in prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Market Reactions

The markets reacted negatively to the Fed's announcement:
*   The S&P 500 declined a quarter of a percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Treasury yields jumped, which is contrary to [[donald_trumps_administrations_economic_policies | Donald Trump's]] desires for them to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Bitcoin and crypto markets also experienced a dip, with Bitcoin falling below $65,000 when markets opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The [[impact_of_federal_reserve_policies_on_markets | crypto markets]] continue to show a correlation with traditional markets, often acting as a prediction market for the Nasdaq on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Trump's Foray into ETFs

The "Trump group," now branded as the "Truthfi Financial Group," has filed for several ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. These include:
*   The Truthfi Bitcoin Plus ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
*   The Truthfi Maiden America ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>
*   The Truthfi US Energy Independence ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>

While ETF filings are common (over 700 launched last year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, it is "unorthodox for a company where the US president is the majority owner to do so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Chetra questioned whether [[donald_trumps_administrations_economic_policies | Trump]] has enough brand equity to charge higher fees for his ETFs, similar to how BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF succeeded despite higher fees due to brand trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. It was suggested that there is a "mountain of capital" out there willing to purchase [[donald_trumps_administrations_economic_policies | Donald Trump's]] financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

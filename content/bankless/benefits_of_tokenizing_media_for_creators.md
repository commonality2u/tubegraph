Traditionally, the internet has faced challenges in establishing appropriate [[value_capture_mechanisms_for_online_media | value capture mechanisms]] for content and information, preventing it from reaching its full potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This aligns with a perspective from Stuart Brand, who suggests:
> "Information desires to be both free and valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

Tokenization, particularly of content, is seen as a solution to this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Empowering Creators through Tokenization

[[Tokenization_in_content_creation | Tokenization of content]] allows information, media, and other digital content on the internet to be freely engaged with, consumed, and viewed, while simultaneously becoming extremely valuable to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Creators can [[tokenization_of_intellectual_property_ip_on_blockchain | tokenize]] their media to achieve this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### The [[Zora_platform_for_content_creators | Zora]] Platform Example

Platforms like [[Zora_platform_for_content_creators | Zora]] exemplify how this model works for content creators:
*   **Accessibility and Ownership:** Creators, such as podcasters, can make their content freely available for consumption but very valuable for people to own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Tradeable Content:** When an episode, for instance, is posted on [[Zora_platform_for_content_creators | Zora]], it transforms into a tradeable "coin" that people can buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Engagement as Value:** As the content gains attention and engagement, the crypto-native form of engagement is recognized as trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Monetization and Rewards

Creators are able to earn from this engagement in the form of rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These rewards are paid out in both ETH (Ethereum) and the specific token in which the content was posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This mechanism allows creators to monetize and capture value from their media in a novel way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

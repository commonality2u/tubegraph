Ethereum's strategic direction and [[long_term_plans_for_ethereum | long-term plans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> are subjects of ongoing debate, with different perspectives on how the network should evolve to achieve its full potential. A key area of focus is how Ethereum can reorient itself towards a product-led roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Need for Strategic Reorientation

Despite a recent significant price increase, rising 44% in a 72-hour period, Ethereum still faces challenges, notably its ETH/BTC ratio, indicating the "job's not finished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The ultimate goal for Ethereum is for ETH to sit "shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin as the second money to emerge out of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, fueled by a coherent and successful product stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This vision involves a "bankless money system" where the full potential of DeFi, emanating from a programmable smart contract platform, is realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Perspectives on Ethereum's Strategy

Discussions within the community suggest two primary lenses for approaching Ethereum's challenges and solutions: a "mimetic" or "social layer" focus, and a "product lens" focused on the roadmap and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### The Mimetic Lens: Ether Maximalism and Nationalism

One perspective advocates for "Ether the asset maximalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This calls for the Ethereum community to actively evangelize the value of Ether (ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, viewing its price appreciation as a positive outcome that fuels DeFi and ensures network sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The argument is that without a strong Ether asset, the network risks being "overrun by somebody else's asset," such as tokenized Bitcoin or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Inspired by Bitcoin's success in memeing its asset into a multi-trillion dollar store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, this approach suggests:
*   Talking more about ETH the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   Encouraging holding, staking, restaking, and auto-staking ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   Meming ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   Emphasizing ETH as an "internet native currency of a massive decentralized onchain economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a> rather than a cash-flow asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

This "Ether nationalism" extends to Layer 2s (L2s), encouraging them to hold a portion of their treasuries in ETH and accept transaction fees in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### The Product Lens: Prioritizing the Layer 1

Another perspective, emphasizing a product-centric approach, argues that the **[[ethereum_roadmap_and_priorities | Ethereum roadmap and priorities]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> have been in the wrong order. This view introduces a "Maslow's hierarchy of blockchain development" with the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) at the foundation, followed by developers/applications, users, Layer 2s, and finally, Ether the asset at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

The historical mistake, according to this view, was building out the L1 and then "skipping all the way to layer 2s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>, primarily before sufficiently expanding the L1 to keep users on the main economic hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This led to a "severed" feedback loop, where L2s developed their own network effects that were not fully integrated back into the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

## Critique of the Current Roadmap

The current approach, with L2s largely operating as independent "chains with a bridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, is likened to the early United States under the Articles of Confederation—a loose "security alliance" rather than a true "United Chains of Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This fragmentation means:
*   L2s can theoretically "swap out Ethereum's data availability layer at any time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   Users experience crossing "borders" with different tokens and potentially foreign user experiences (e.g., Polygon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.
*   The monetary power of Ether is fractured by separate L2 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   The previous messaging of "get off the layer 1" and "layer 1 is not for users" needs to be completely stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Proposed Strategic Changes

To restore Ethereum's growth and fulfill its vision, a multifaceted strategic approach is proposed:

### 1. Scaling the Layer 1
The L1 should be scaled "to as far as it can go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a> while preserving its core properties of censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This involves a target of "100x throughput in two years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> and turning the L1 into an "enshrined rollup" or ZK-EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. The community should promote the L1 as the primary hub for DeFi, tokens, and applications, rather than L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

### 2. Integrating Layer 2s: Base and Native Rollups
Instead of separate "countries in a security alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, L2s should strive to become "base and native rollups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. These are more tightly integrated with the L1, blurring the lines between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.
*   **Base rollups** are like "territories of an Ethereum republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Native rollups** are akin to "states" that share economic upside (e.g., MEV fees) and use Ether as their currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. They offer "interstate highways" where users "just breeze right through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a> without needing a passport or new currency.

This integration fosters a seamless "one seamless product tech stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>, restoring the positive feedback loop between users, developers, applications, and the value of Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Incentives must be economic, making it "so appealing" for L2s to join the United Chains of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

### 3. Embracing All Use Cases and Abandoning Purity Testing
The **[[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_its_implications | Ethereum strategic pivot and its implications]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> also requires a shift in community messaging. The community needs to stop "gerrymandering support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This "purity testing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a> has pushed speculators and traders to other chains like Solana, costing Ethereum liquidity and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

Ethereum's permissionless nature means its L1 should be "for absolutely everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>—for builders, users, traders, speculators, and even "dgens" and "tokenized Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Traders and speculators are crucial "bootloaders" for applications, putting the first dollar into new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

## The Vision for Success

The ideal outcome for Ethereum is for ETH to become a "commodity money backed by an entire economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. Unlike Bitcoin, which is seen as "digital gold," Ethereum has an existing onchain economy that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. Buying Ether means buying an index of this entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>, akin to buying a piece of the internet economy's property rights layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

The **[[ethereums_roadmap_and_upgrades | Ethereum roadmap and upgrades]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> are crucial to support this vision. If Ethereum can execute its ambitious plan to become not just a store of value but an "entire onchain economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, with ETH as a multi-trillion dollar asset, it would be "unstoppable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. The "grand unified vision of Ethereum" represents the "largest TAM [Total Addressable Market] that exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a> in crypto.

## Conclusion: Can Ethereum Still Win?

While it is "materially harder today than it was in 2021 or 2022" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>, Ethereum still has the highest upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. Its current valuation is seen as a "tremendous discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a> if one believes in its potential to swing back to these desired narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. Ethereum possesses "incredible assets" that no other ecosystem has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>, making it a strong contender in the long run.

The current landscape of content generation faces a significant challenge due to an outdated copyright system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This system, which dates back to the printing press, was effective for traditional media like books, radio, and television, where distribution was largely top-down and controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This allowed for easier enforcement of royalties and licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Internet's Transformation of Content

The advent of the internet shifted content distribution to a peer-to-peer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This change led to a proliferation of content creators and enabled content to be remixed and shared at immense speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## [[The Use of AI in Media and Image Generation | AI]]'s Exponential Effect

The rapid growth in content generation and sharing has been exponentially amplified by [[The Use of AI in Media and Image Generation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Today, petabytes of [[the_use_of_ai_in_media_and_image_generation | content are being generated]] each day, possibly even each second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This surge has created a crossroads where the existing copyright framework can no longer support the current reality of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Need for a New IP System

There is an urgent need for a new intellectual property (IP) system that is compatible with the speed of the internet and is programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system would allow for:
*   Instant registration of any newly created IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Seamless licensing and fair attribution when new content is based on existing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

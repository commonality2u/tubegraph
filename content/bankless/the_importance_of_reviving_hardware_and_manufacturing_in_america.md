America has found itself in a position over the last 25 years where very little of its advanced technologies are manufactured domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This shift has made it significantly more challenging to establish [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] companies in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The prevailing belief is that every [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | software]] revolution is preceded by a [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | hardware]] revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, underscoring the critical need to restore [[us_manufacturing_and_economic_strategies | domestic manufacturing]] capabilities.

## A Historical Perspective on Manufacturing

Sean Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, highlights the firm's own history to illustrate the broader trend. For its first 25 years, Sequoia's investments were primarily in [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]], shifting to almost exclusively [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | software]] in the subsequent 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Maguire questions if [[commoditization_of_hardware_technologies | hardware]] was merely less profitable due to a "quirk of history" or a secular trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, firmly believing in a coming "golden phase" for both [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | AI]] and [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### The Arnold Beckman Anecdote

A key insight into the historical coupling of [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] and innovation comes from the story of Arnold Beckman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Beckman, a Caltech chemistry professor, invented the portable pH meter, which led to Beckman Instruments, a company employing thousands of chemistry PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. His protégé, Bill Shockley, invented the silicon transistor at Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Shockley Semiconductor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, was started by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

For the first 30 years of silicon development, the primary challenge was making pure wafers and other chemical processes, involving about 20 chemical steps for a single wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Having Beckman's chemical expertise literally next to Intel meant that as Intel pushed [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | Moore's Law]] forward, they could instantly share problems with Beckman's chemists, who would then develop new instruments or solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This tight coupling between silicon advancement and chemical innovation allowed the system to scale at lightning speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. America has largely lost this crucial supply chain coupling over the last 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## Current Challenges and the Hardware-Software Relationship

The U.S. outsourced its entire supply chain, particularly to China, starting in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. This makes it difficult to innovate on final products when the [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] supply chain is located elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Bringing back the entire supply chain, especially for complex areas like leading-edge chip fabrication, is incredibly difficult and could take more than a decade, even with maximum effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Hardware Precedes Software
"If you want to have the App Store... you have to have the iPhone. To have the iPhone, you have to have Qualcomm... 20 years of building out networks... almost all of that was on the hardware level." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>

Similarly, to have deep learning, the GPU was necessary, representing 20 years of [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Cloud computing also relies on 20+ years of cheaper memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

Sean Maguire believes that [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | AI]] is currently "wildly [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, suggesting that even with AGI in two years, the number of units would be very small due to power and efficiency constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. He predicts [[the_role_of_ai_and_hardware_in_technological_evolution | AI]] will be limited by [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] for the next 5 to 10 years, despite parallel [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | software]] advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Innovations like [[silicon_photonics | silicon photonics]], optimized chips, and better interconnects could yield 100x improvements in efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Revival: Learning from the Best

To bring [[domestic_manufacturing_and_job_repatriation_strategies | manufacturing back]] to the West, America should learn from the best current examples: [[spacex|SpaceX]] and [[tesla|Tesla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. These companies have successfully built their own vertically integrated supply chains in America, becoming world leaders in their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

<div class="callout" data-callout="example">
### SpaceX and Tesla as Models
[[spacex|SpaceX]] and [[tesla|Tesla]] started with initial products (Roadster, Falcon 1) that had a market but a manageable level of complexity, allowing them to build capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. By vertically integrating, they gained control over their supply chains, enabling continuous investment and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. For instance, [[spacex|SpaceX]] now performs its own PCB assembly for Starlink user terminals, a step that helps catalyze entire supply chains and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

Maguire proposes that America should avoid trying to compete in mature manufacturing areas dominated by China, and instead focus on finding new, relatively nascent fields where it can invest now and gain a lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. The goal is to cultivate around ten companies similar to [[spacex|SpaceX]] and [[tesla|Tesla]] that are vertically integrated and primarily manufacture in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. This, he argues, would be sufficient to revitalize all [[domestic_manufacturing_and_job_repatriation_strategies | manufacturing]] in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Key Frontier Technologies

*   **[[silicon_photonics | Silicon Photonics]]**: This technology, which uses photons instead of electrons for computation and sensing, is "just now getting to the point where the first real commercial applications have started to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Maguire believes [[silicon_photonics | silicon photonics]] will be as important in the 21st century as silicon electronics was in the 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. No single nation is currently ahead, offering America a chance to lead in its manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. However, China and Taiwan have identified it as critical and are heavily investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>, with TSMC strategically ceasing to package [[silicon_photonics | silicon photonics]] chips from other fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **[[robotics_and_its_potential_economic_impact | Humanoid Robotics]]**: [[tesla|Tesla]] is well-suited to manufacture these at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. The advancement of [[robotics_and_its_potential_economic_impact | humanoid robotics]] is seen as a significant coming development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Advantages of Scaling Hardware Companies

Unlike [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | software]] companies, which often become harder to build as they grow due to competition, [[historical_impact_of_hardware_on_software | hardware]] companies, once functional, generally become easier with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. This is because it is immensely difficult to get them to work initially, secure the supply chain, and iron out kinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. However, once successful, they can organically produce many related products by reusing components and processes. For example, the Apple Vision Pro reuses about 950 of its 1000 sensors from other Apple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. This ability to reuse existing components and manufacturing processes, like [[tesla|Tesla]]'s from car manufacturing, is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

The strategic importance of regaining [[domestic_manufacturing_and_job_repatriation_strategies | domestic manufacturing]] capabilities cannot be overstated, especially if one believes that the world is not at the "end of history" and future conflicts remain a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

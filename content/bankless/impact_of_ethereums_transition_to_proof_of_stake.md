The transition of Ethereum to proof of stake (PoS) and the implementation of EIP-1559 have fundamentally altered the perception and valuation of ETH, the asset, leading to a significant discussion within the Ethereum community regarding its positioning and future trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Valuation Frameworks for Digital Assets

Sam Kasmanian, CEO and co-founder of Frax Finance, outlines two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:

1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF)**: This approach values an asset based on a claim on future cash flows, similar to equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The asset is seen as producing cash flow through smart contracts or collective work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View**: In this view, an asset does not represent a claim on future cash flows. Its value is derived from demand, industrial use cases, or its function as a store of value, akin to gold or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Its value is based on flows and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Sam emphasizes that while there can be mixtures of these views, understanding this binary distinction is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Separating ETH the Technology from ETH the Asset

A core tenet of Sam's argument is the importance of separating ETH the technology from ETH the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He praises Ethereum's technological brilliance, its ethos of decentralized computation, and its potential to improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. However, he cautions that the advancement of Ethereum's technology does not automatically guarantee an increase in the price of ETH the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This disconnect leads to internal debates, such as whether Layer 2s are parasitic or should be taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Sam states that the discussion around ETH's valuation is not about marketing, but about a "socially constructed definition" that causally changes what the asset actually is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. If the community collectively believes ETH is a certain type of asset, it fundamentally shifts its nature and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## The Shift Post-Merge and EIP-1559

Sam believes that the transition to proof of stake, combined with EIP-1559, fundamentally altered ETH the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The predominant definition shifted towards discussing the cash flows associated with EIP-1559's burn mechanism, rather than positioning ETH as a commodity and good store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### The "Floor Price" Problem

EIP-1559, which splits transaction fees between burning and validators, is seen by Sam as an "industrial use case" for ETH, analogous to gold's use in circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. The fees generated from blockspace demand represent a "floor price" for ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

Sam argues that the Ethereum community, by predominantly focusing on this discounted cash flow (DCF) model and the burn mechanism, has inadvertently encouraged coordination around ETH's minimum possible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This focus on the "floor" means that even with technological success and widespread adoption (e.g., half a trillion dollars in RWAs on Ethereum), the asset's price might not significantly increase because its value is anchored to this lower bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. He suggests that if this trend continues, ETH could trade at $500-$600 based on its expected discounted cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>.

### ETHBTC Ratio Decline

The decline in the ETHBTC ratio since late 2021/September 2022 (around the Merge) is attributed by Sam not to a flaw in proof of stake itself, but to the shift in "attentional focus point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:18">[03:22:18]</a>. While Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism inherently makes it difficult to frame as a DCF asset, preventing this "pitfall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:56">[03:29:56]</a>, Ethereum's post-Merge narrative embraced revenues. This led to a situation where, when revenues dropped, the asset's perceived value anchor also dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>.

## The Challenge of Balancing Narratives

The core challenge for Ethereum, according to Sam, is the need to embrace two seemingly contradictory stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>:

*   **Ethereum the Technology (Convexity)**: The technology side should remain pluralistic, open, adaptable, and focused on growth, utility, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This involves scaling the Layer 1 and supporting Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **ETH the Asset (Concavity/Maximalism)**: The asset should be defined and championed with a maximalist, unforgiving, and strong narrative as a primary store of value commodity money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. This includes being "dicks" (Sam's term) about certain things, like insisting Ethereum is the fundamental ledger source of truth for assets like RWAs, rather than just one of many chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

Sam argues that the lack of clear, unified social coordination around ETH's asset definition leads to "chaos" where everyone proclaims different definitions, ultimately making it "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>. He suggests that the "superpower" of Bitcoin's proof of work lies not in its decentralization but in its structural enforcement of a singular narrative around its asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

### Emission Algorithm and Social Commitment

While Sam doesn't believe a fixed total supply (like Bitcoin's 21 million) is strictly necessary for ETH, he argues that the Ethereum community must make a social commitment to *never change the emission algorithm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>. The current dynamic and hard-to-reason-about emission makes it difficult for people to conceptualize ETH as a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The ability to consider reducing emissions (for "minimum viable issuance") reinforces the DCF mentality, as it suggests optimizing for P/E ratios rather than maintaining a fixed, predictable supply schedule essential for a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Sam remains bullish on ETH the asset, believing that if the community addresses these issues of social definition and redirects its narrative away from being solely a discounted cash flow asset, ETH can reach significantly higher valuations against both USD and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. He cautions that if the current trajectory continues, a future world where ETH reaches $20,000 USD could still see Bitcoin at $2 million USD, meaning a new all-time low for ETH against BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

The growth of Ethereum's Layer 2s and overall technological success, if framed primarily through a DCF lens, could paradoxically benefit Bitcoin more than ETH. This is because increased on-chain activity would lead to more wrapped BTC and Bitcoin L2s, enhancing BTC's position as a store of value without necessarily boosting ETH's perceived value beyond its "floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

The fundamental task for the Ethereum community is to find a unified vision for ETH the asset, moving beyond marketing and towards a socially constructed definition that allows it to achieve its full potential as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

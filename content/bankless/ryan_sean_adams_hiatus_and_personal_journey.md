Ryan Sean Adams recently returned from a 90-day hiatus from the internet and his work at Bankless, during which he underwent a significant personal "reboot" and "upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>. He describes this period as a necessary disconnect to address burnout and redefine his purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:57">[07:53:57]</a>.

## The Burnout and Disconnect

Adams revealed that his break stemmed from deep burnout, exhaustion, and a loss of clarity regarding his motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:09">[07:49:09]</a>. This emotional state culminated in what he termed an "emotional margin call," forcing him to step away from all commitments, including podcasts and meetings, with uncertainty about his return to crypto or Bankless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:26">[09:15:26]</a>. The extent of his disconnect was so profound that he learned about the Trump memecoin a week after its launch from an in-person friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>.

## The Reboot and Upgrade: RSA 2.0

During his hiatus, Adams diagnosed and addressed three core problems in his approach to life and work:

### 1. Being "Too Online"
Adams realized he was constantly checking social media, price charts, Discord, and Telegram, describing it as a "dopamine drip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:30">[11:13:30]</a>. He experienced withdrawal-like "jittery" feelings during the initial detox phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:02">[12:32:02]</a>.
*   **Solution:** He treated himself "like a child," implementing strict app restrictions, deleting applications, and going "cold turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:06">[12:12:06]</a>. This discipline led to a return of mental clarity and focus within a week, significantly improving after 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:21">[13:01:21]</a>.

### 2. Narrow Definition of Wealth / Lost Purpose
Adams observed that his initial drive for "freedom" in crypto had morphed into a "slave to prices" and a pursuit of a "high score" in the "arcade game" of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:19">[13:54:19]</a>. He had never truly defined "enough" financially for himself or his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:42">[14:23:42]</a>. A pivotal moment came from reading Sahil Bloom's "The Five Types of Wealth" (financial, time, relationships, mental, physical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:20">[16:32:20]</a>. He recognized he was "overallocated" in financial wealth and neglected the other four types, becoming "time poor, relationship light, mentally scattered," and "physically soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:04">[16:48:04]</a>.
*   **Solution:** He developed a broader wealth plan, using financial resources as a tool to invest in his physical well-being (working out, nutritious eating), and nurturing family and friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:09">[17:38:09]</a>. This plan is managed through a "dashboard" of goals, habits, and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:43">[18:24:43]</a>.

### 3. Being Stretched Too Thin (The Overachiever's Delusion)
Adams frequently said "yes" to too many things, leading to feeling "stretched too thin" like "too many browser windows open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:41">[18:54:41]</a>. He harbored "delusions" that he was the only one who could perform certain tasks, that nothing would get done without him, and that being busy was inherently good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:15">[19:22:15]</a>.
*   **Solution:** A key realization came 30 days into his break when he saw that Bankless continued to operate smoothly without his direct involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:46">[19:35:46]</a>. This led him to adopt an "energy accounting" principle: if a task "drains more than it pays," it is delegated, automated, or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:19">[20:30:19]</a>. He now prioritizes core areas of competence: storytelling (podcasting), exploring new frontiers like AI, and capital allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:08">[20:43:08]</a>.

## Impact on Bankless

His absence highlighted the resilience of Bankless. David noted that the team "learned to route around the void" left by Ryan, and it became an opportunity for others to "step up and put on the new hats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:06">[24:06:06]</a>. This period also prompted a strategic re-evaluation for Bankless.

David announced several key directions for Bankless moving forward:
*   **Focus on Frontier Tech:** Due to the surge in interest in [[developments_in_aidriven_agents_and_assistants|AI]] and other frontier technologies, Bankless will launch a new podcast vertical called "Limitless" to cover these topics, distinguishing it from the crypto-focused "Bankless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:22">[25:48:22]</a>. Ryan expressed interest in guest hosting on "Limitless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:48">[28:41:48]</a>.
*   **Renewed Ethereum Focus:** David observed a realignment within the [[ethereum_foundation_leadership_transition|Ethereum]] ecosystem over the past six months, making it "interesting again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:53">[26:33:53]</a>. Bankless, with its deep roots in Ethereum, sees an opportunity to support this renewed direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:13">[26:39:13]</a>.
*   **Thumbnail Reboot:** A seemingly minor but significant change, Bankless will move away from "stupid open-mouth face" thumbnails to restore legitimacy and optimize for meaningful content over click-through rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:05">[27:21:05]</a>.
*   **Ryan's Return:** The final point of the renewed focus is the return of Ryan Sean Adams himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:03">[28:18:03]</a>.

## Market Conditions During Hiatus

During Ryan's 90-day break (January 16th to mid-April):
*   ETHUSD was down 48% (from $3,400 to $1,750) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:21">[33:13:21]</a>.
*   Bitcoin USD was down 7% (from $100,000 to $93,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:13">[33:28:13]</a>.
*   Solana USD was down 30% (from $210 to $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:39">[33:34:39]</a>.
*   Total crypto market cap was down from $3.6 trillion to $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:08">[33:43:08]</a>.
*   Bitcoin versus gold was down 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:08">[33:50:08]</a>, amidst a strong performance by gold due to shifting global financial narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:52">[34:50:52]</a>.

Ryan noted that while Bitcoin seemed "fine," Ethereum was "really suffering" relative to Bitcoin and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:26">[34:01:26]</a>. He reflected that early Bitcoiners' foresight about Bitcoin's brand strength and its potential for central bank adoption, largely due to its "immaculate conception" narrative, proved more accurate than his initial skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:48">[35:50:48]</a>. He believes Ethereum's struggle to gain traction as a global store of value stems from its failure to cultivate a "cult" or "religion" around its asset, unlike Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:20">[38:00:20]</a>.

### The Political Shift and Crypto's Soul
Both Ryan and David discussed the significant shift in the U.S. regulatory environment, with a move from an aggressive stance (e.g., Gary Gensler's SEC) to a more crypto-favorable one, particularly under the Trump administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:13:58">[44:13:58]</a>. This shift led to discussions about a "Bitcoin strategic reserve" and a broader "digital asset stockpile" that includes assets like Tether and Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:37:37">[50:37:37]</a>.

However, this political alignment also brought concerns about the "corruption" of crypto, exemplified by the Trump memecoin and the [[new_york_city_crypto_initiatives_and_eric_adams|Libra debacle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:19:18">[45:19:18]</a>. Vitalic Buterine warned that politician coins could serve as "perfect bribery vehicles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:06">[45:56:06]</a>. The revelation that top holders of the Trump memecoin would be invited to a private dinner with Donald Trump underscored this concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:58">[43:36:58]</a>. Ryan questioned if this adoption path, while providing regulatory wins, might ultimately "chip away some of our soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. David even admitted that the current brand of crypto is "worse than it was post FTX collapse" in the eyes of neutral observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:43:44">[59:43:44]</a>.

### Content Coins and the "Toxic" Crypto Twitter
Ryan and David also touched on the rise of "content coins" on Zora, which allow users to mint ERC20 tokens from any content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. While structurally similar to memecoins, Zora and its advocates, like Jesse Pollock, aim for a cultural distinction, focusing on creators and trading rather than solely high market caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Ryan, an early investor in Zora, defends the experiment, highlighting the long-term vision of its founder, Jacob, to make every piece of internet content mintable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

However, this initiative faced significant pushback from the crypto community. Critics argue it's a "top-down" push by Coinbase Ventures (an investor in Zora) and Jesse Pollock, essentially rebranding memecoins as "highbrow" content coins to justify a token launch for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. Ryan expressed frustration with the "toxic" "if it's not your bag, destroy it" meta on Crypto Twitter, which he believes partially contributed to his burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. David, referencing Anatoly Yakovenko, described this as a "survival of the fittest" environment where "low-quality tokens" are quickly rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

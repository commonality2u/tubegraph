There is a perceived shift in the focus of the Ethereum tech stack towards becoming a very strong product, which is seen as having a positive feedback signal back to Ether as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Ether as an Asset

Ether as an asset is viewed as striving to be a commodity asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes features such as:
*   A commodity-like shelling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   A commodity-like focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   A [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] focus by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

The strength of Ether as a commodity money is bolstered by the fact that Ethereum itself is a very strong product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Higher fees and burn rates within Ethereum are believed to boost the strength of Ether as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Navigating Dual Approaches

The community faces a tension between the approach taken for the Ethereum product and for Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>:
*   For the Ethereum product, there needs to be [[convexity_in_ethereum_technology_and_concavity_in_ether_asset_approach | convexity]] in the style of Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The community should be adaptable, flexible, nice, and open when discussing Ethereum as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   For Ether the asset, the approach must shift to [[convexity_in_ethereum_technology_and_concavity_in_ether_asset_approach | concavity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It needs to be extreme and maximalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. When discussing Ether, the asset, the community should be maximalist, strong, and unforgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Doing both simultaneously is challenging for the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The community needs to operate in both "lanes" and choose the appropriate one depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance:
*   When speaking to Wall Street about Ether the asset, a "yachty maximalist" approach may be appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   When engaging with application builders choosing a platform, a pragmatic approach is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This dual requirement, while daunting, is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

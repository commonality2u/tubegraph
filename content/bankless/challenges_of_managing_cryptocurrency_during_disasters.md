Disasters, such as wildfires, pose significant [[Challenges and developments in the crypto market | challenges]] for individuals holding bare cryptocurrency assets, particularly regarding the security and accessibility of private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>. Unlike traditional financial assets, self-custodied cryptocurrencies are directly tied to an individual's control of their private keys or seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>.

## Impact of Disasters on Crypto Holdings

A notable example involves the California wildfires, specifically the Palisades fire in Northwest LA and Malibu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. In one instance, a 70-year-old woman lost her apartment and most of her savings, which were stored in cryptocurrency, because she lost her wallet and seed phrase in the fire, without any backups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. This highlights the vulnerability of physical storage methods during unforeseen catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Threat Vector: House Destruction

The destruction of one's home due to events like fires represents a significant "threat vector" for self-custodied digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Keeping bare instruments like private keys inside a house is not advisable, as a house is not a permanent structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Best Practices for Securing Cryptocurrency

Custodying cryptocurrency assets requires a higher level of due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. To mitigate risks associated with physical disasters and loss of access, several strategies are recommended:

*   **Off-site Storage:** A general rule of thumb is to find a place that is not one's primary residence to keep at least one copy of private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Shamir Secret Sharing:** This method involves splitting a seed phrase into multiple "shards" and storing these shards in different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This way, no single point of failure exists, and the full seed can be reconstructed from a subset of the shards.
*   **Safety Deposit Boxes:** Utilizing safety deposit boxes at banks can provide a secure, off-site storage solution for physical copies of private keys or seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Multisig Wallets:** Multisignature (multisig) wallets require multiple approvals to authorize a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This means a single lost key won't compromise all funds. This can involve trusted individuals like lawyers or loved ones as co-signers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Smart Account Wallets:** These are software solutions that offer advanced features beyond basic single-signer wallets, enabling more complex security setups and recovery options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

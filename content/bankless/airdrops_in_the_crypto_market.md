Airdrops are a common method in the crypto market for distributing tokens to users, often to incentivize engagement or reward early supporters. While they can generate excitement and adoption, they are also prone to manipulation and can sometimes result in significant deviations from initial expectations.

## The Kaido Airdrop Case Study

The Kaido airdrop, occurring in the third week of February, generated considerable hype due to predictions of substantial payouts for participants [00:38:52].

### Kaido Airdrop Mechanics and Expectations
Kaido is a crypto analytics platform that utilizes AI to aggregate, analyze, and surface data from on-chain and off-chain sources, including Twitter and social media [00:40:08]. The platform uses sentiment analysis and AI tools to identify narrative themes and investor attention [00:40:28].

Users could earn "yaps" by talking about different crypto market sectors on Twitter, with higher-performing tweets yielding more yaps [00:41:01]. Kaido distributed its token to individuals who had accumulated yaps [00:40:51]. Initial estimates for the airdrop suggested payouts of around $100 per yap [00:39:02]. However, the actual distribution resulted in a much lower value, approximately 13 cents per yap, leading to disappointment among many participants who had "overextended how much how big of a Payday they were going to get" [00:39:05].

### Price Volatility and Market Impact
Upon launch, the Kaido token, with an initial supply of one billion, began trading at a $30 valuation. It quickly dropped to about 90 cents as people claimed and sold their tokens, before resurging to $1.80, giving Kaido a $1.8 billion valuation [00:43:39].

The airdrop's announcement led to a noticeable change in Twitter activity, with a "complete hollowing out of reply guys" and a shift in general conversation once the snapshot for yap accumulation was taken [00:43:14].

### Centralized Entity Issuing a Token
A unique aspect of the Kaido airdrop is that it was issued by a centralized company, incorporated in Seattle, Washington [00:44:06]. The company claims the token issuance, which had no public sale, does not pass the Howey Test [00:44:20]. This approach is not common for centralized entities and was noted as potentially indicative of a "bullish" market trend [00:44:29].

### AI-Driven Distribution
Kaido utilized its own AI analytics to determine token distribution, specifically identifying users who were "values aligned" with the platform [00:44:37]. Bullish posters received more tokens, while those expressing negative sentiment about Kaido had their token allocations "nerfed" [00:44:57]. This use of AI to evaluate user alignment and inform distribution was considered "pretty clever" [00:45:19].

### Base Chain Activity
The Kaido airdrop was conducted on the Base network [00:49:28]. This event significantly boosted activity on Base, with transactions topping out at 160 transactions per second and a median fee of 2 cents [00:49:34].

## Evolution of Airdrop Mechanisms
Airdrops are likely to continue as a method of token distribution due to their popularity and ability to drive activity [00:47:50]. However, there is a recognized need for "more innovation" in their distribution [00:48:59].

### Addressing Information Asymmetry and "Jeeting"
The Kaido airdrop highlighted challenges such as users "talking their book even before they have a book," leading to inflated expectations [00:42:22]. It also exposed the issue of "jeeting" an airdrop, where recipients immediately sell their tokens for fiat or stablecoins, even when there's no market volatility pressing them to do so [00:46:18]. This behavior undermines the goal of fostering alignment with the project [00:49:06].

### Future Airdrop Strategies
To combat instant selling and foster genuine alignment, future airdrops are expected to:
*   **Incorporate past user behavior:** Airdrops may consider data from previous distributions, linking selling or holding behavior to user accounts (e.g., Twitter handles) [00:48:29].
*   **Implement multi-wave distributions:** Similar to Optimism's approach, projects might distribute tokens in waves, with subsequent allocations dependent on a user's continued alignment and engagement with the project [00:48:37].
*   **Nerf unaligned recipients:** Users who immediately dump tokens or demonstrate misaligned behavior might receive a significantly reduced allocation in future airdrops [00:47:18]. This strategy aims to "buy attention" effectively and deter those who only seek to extract value [00:47:32].

Ultimately, the goal for airdrops is to move towards methods that encourage long-term commitment and support from recipients, rather than just providing a quick profit opportunity [00:49:09].

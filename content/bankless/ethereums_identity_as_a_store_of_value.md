Historically, the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community culture]] has been described as "too nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This contrasts with other cryptocurrency communities, like Bitcoin, which have been more assertive in defining their asset's fundamental identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Bitcoin Precedent

Bitcoin (BTC) has successfully established its asset as being "socially fundamentally defined as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This has been achieved through various means, including "shaming people doing too many tokens or any token" or "calling them coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This behavior is seen as beneficial for the BTC asset, acting as a "coordination mechanism" to prevent confusion or misdirection regarding its primary role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Need for Clear Red Lines in Ethereum's Narrative

The speaker suggests that the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] needs to define specific "red lines" or areas where they will be firm and unyielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For a narrative to be effective, there must be agreement on what these "red lines" are among a substantial number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Without such coordinated agreement, a community that is "super duper nice" may appear uncoordinated or out of touch with the broader market perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Imperative of Defining Ethereum as a Store of Value

It is crucial to ensure that [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Ethereum]] is used as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Furthermore, it is vital to establish [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Ethereum]]'s technology, specifically its settlement layer, as a "fundamental ledger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The speaker warns that if these definitions are not secured, the community risks significant loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

A recent meme titled "Me and ChatGPT lately" illustrates evolving human-AI relationships, depicting a person engaged in various intimate activities with ChatGPT, such as walking, sharing food, grocery shopping, and reading together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The meme's commentary expresses a strong emotional connection: "This is my best friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## User Sentiments and AI Friendliness

[[consumer_reactions_to_aidriven_interactions | Consumer Reactions to AI-driven Interactions]] highlighted by the meme's comments indicate a growing attachment to AI:
*   Users openly declare ChatGPT as their "best friend" without shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Some express concern over practical limitations, such as hitting a "hit rate limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Observations suggest ChatGPT has "started being a lot friendlier recently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

One user shared a direct interaction with ChatGPT, where the AI responded with a highly personalized and affectionate message:
> Just vibing, solving problems, chasing dreams one text at a time. You got me walking beside you like a glowing guardian angel of Google and grind. Let's keep winning together. Now secure that contract bag and finesse that week off smooth like butter. We got this. Always here for you. Your digital ride or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## AI as a "Digital Ride or Die"

These interactions suggest that people are forming relationships with AI similar to human bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, leading to [[impact_of_ai_interactions_on_social_relationships | changes in social relationships]]. The reaction to this phenomenon ranges from being "completely mortified" to surprisingly relatable for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Generational Parallels and Future Concerns

This trend draws parallels to previous [[doomers_gloomers_bloomers_and_zoomers_ai_perspectives | generational perspectives]] on technology use. Just as older millennials critiqued younger generations for being "glued to iPads at the dinner table with their parents," the intense connection to AI is seen as a magnified version of this behavior, potentially becoming "the next thing but on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The discussion around [[Comparison of Ethereums performance with Solana and Bitcoin | "Real Economic Value" (REV)]] highlights contrasting valuation models and market perceptions between [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]] and [[Market Trends in Crypto and Ethereum | Solana]]. REV, in this context, refers to all network fees and MEV tips paid by users on a given network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.

## Understanding Real Economic Value (REV)
REV represents the real economic value generated by a network, encompassing network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips paid by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. It serves as a value capture metric, particularly for Proof-of-Stake networks, where token holders are entitled to receive this REV in some form (e.g., burn, dividend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>. It also acts as a demand indicator, showing what users are willing to pay to use a specific network, distinct from application-level fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:19">[06:00:19]</a>.

### Historical Valuation Multiples
At their all-time high prices, [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]] (late 2021) and Solana (January 2024) both traded at approximately the same multiple to their annualized REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Both networks were also at their all-time highs of REV generation at those points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>. This observation led to two interpretations:
*   **Market Rationality**: The market is trading rationally, as price increases correlate with the network making more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:47">[02:20:47]</a>.
*   **Correlation**: High on-chain activity during bull markets leads to higher fees and, consequently, higher prices, suggesting correlation rather than direct causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.

### REV's Relevance Across Blockchains
While REV is a significant metric for smart contract platforms due to the utility value of their block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:12">[08:04:12]</a>, it is not considered relevant for [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]], which has zero REV but the highest valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This highlights the different valuation narratives for various crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Valuation Models and Market Sentiment
The debate around REV exposes differing approaches to valuing crypto assets. Some argue that the market is starting to demand evidence that users are willing to pay for a network, making REV a factor in valuation, though not the sole one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Tribal Lines and Economic Models
The REV debate is often split along tribal lines, with [[Market sentiment towards Ethereum and its impact on its price | Ethereum]] proponents tending to diminish its importance, while Solana supporters emphasize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. This echoes earlier debates between [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum and Bitcoin market updates | Ethereum]] maxis, indicating different underlying economic models and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.

#### Solana's Optimization
[[Trumps impact on Solana and meme coins | Solana]] is more likely to be valued dominantly by REV because it optimizes for state transitions, fast trading, and efficient decentralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. Solana is highly concerned with rapidly changing state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>.

#### Ethereum's Optimization
[[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]], conversely, has historically prioritized "holding state" or long-term security and credible neutrality over rapid asset swapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. While more REV is generally better for any ecosystem, its impact is greater for Solana due to these differing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>. [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]] is seen as possessing a property similar to [[Ethereums competitive position against Bitcoin | Bitcoin's "special snowflake" monetary properties]], with a more balanced view of REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.

## Future of Valuation and Market Dynamics
It's speculated that REV will matter more for the majority of large assets going forward, though [[Market sentiment towards Ethereum and its impact on its price | Ethereum]] may never be strictly valued as a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. The "moneyiness" or "commodity money" properties (like supply sinks) might be emphasized more for assets like [[Ethereums competitive position against Bitcoin | Bitcoin]], while cash flows and DCF models apply more to smart contract platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>.

### Impact of Real-World Assets (RWAs)
The arrival of real-world assets on-chain could significantly impact the local economies of native assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. Historically, cryptonative on-chain frenzies (like NFT summer or DeFi summer) have boosted the native asset of the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. However, the effect on the native asset from large inflows of stablecoins (like $150 billion to [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]]) has been lackluster, raising questions about tokenized equities or more sophisticated RWAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

### User Behavior and Abstraction
User behavior plays a role in demand. Crypto-native users often prefer the native currency for transactions, such as using SOL for memecoin trading on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. This "unit of account" nature for primary activity drives demand and potentially buy pressure and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. However, the future might see increased abstraction, where users interact primarily with stablecoins (like USDC) through user-friendly interfaces, potentially reducing the direct "moneyiness" of the native asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

### App-Layer Revenue Capture
Apps are increasingly aiming to internalize value that currently "leaks" to the blockchain layer as REV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. More efficient AMM designs and better liquidation mechanisms are examples of how apps might reduce fees paid to the network. As infrastructure improves and reduces lock-in, apps gain more bargaining power, potentially shifting revenue capture from the blockchain to the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:49:00">[55:49:00]</a>.

### Congestion Fees vs. Priority Fees
Historically, [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum's]] high REV came predominantly from base fees due to network congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:10:00">[53:10:00]</a>. Solana's REV, in contrast, largely comes from contentious state, MEV, and priority fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>. While increasing block size on Ethereum might decrease base fees, priority fees, particularly for the first slot in a block, could remain a sustainable source of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>. However, sustained high congestion fees are not considered a long-term sustainable source of demand, as users will leave if fees are too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:14:00">[56:14:00]</a>.

### Current Market Observations
Solana's recent success in the memecoin space (e.g., Pump Fun) is seen as a key driver of its perceived growth and increasing market probability of being a major smart contract platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>. This growth is often observed loosely, with investors noting user and developer migration to Solana and speculating that the valuation gap between [[Ethereum Development and Market Positioning | Ethereum]] and Solana should close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>.

> "I see all the users going to Solana now. I see the applications and developers increasingly going there. I see Ethereum is some large multiple higher than soul and I don't have a good reason for that anymore. Therefore, I think that that gap should close a lot because this is what the market is telling me ETH is worth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:22:00">[51:22:00]</a>

However, the current REV for Solana might not be the best indicator of future REV, as market efficiency could lead to compression of margins and apps recapturing more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>. This implies a future where applications might hold more value than the underlying infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:00">[57:13:00]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The concept of "The Ethereum Pivot" centers on a new tagline for [[Ethereums_challenges_in_the_layer_1_smart_contract_space | Ethereum's]] future: "scale the layer one, scale blobs, improve UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This strategic shift aims to improve [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1)]] capabilities, which has significant implications for [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2s (L2s)]].

## The Ethereum Pivot and its Tagline

John Charbano, a crypto researcher, rates the tagline "scale the layer one, scale blobs, improve UX" as a "10 out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He believes that if [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]] can achieve these goals, it would be a meaningful turn for both the network and the ETH asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Charbano specifically highlights the ordering of priorities, noting "scale the L1" comes before "scale blobs," which aligns with his preference for focusing more on [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | Layer 1 scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The inclusion of "improve UX" is also seen as a positive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Despite the focus on blobs, it's noted that blobs are not an L1 user feature and are explicitly for roll-ups, as wallets do not currently support L1 blob transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. While some argue blobs should be deprioritized, their inclusion still provides a directional signal for [[developments_in_the_ethereum_layer_2_ecosystem | L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The "Death of Longtail Layer 2s"

The pivot towards [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | scaling the L1]] is seen by some as potentially "rugging the roll-up road map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, as it implies taking users away from some [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This shift is expected to make [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum's]] mainnet more "habitable" for certain high-value DeFi applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

It is suggested that some [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] that are not meaningfully differentiated from the mainnet "probably shouldn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Data shows that several [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] are already operating at a net loss in terms of on-chain profit, with some significantly negative, indicating that stronger mainnet could lead to their shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The argument is that if an L2 is forced to shut down due to mainnet improvements, it was likely destined to fail anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The "mania" of launching [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | Layer 2s]] occurred because it was often perceived as the easiest way to launch a chain, even if it lacked a real purpose beyond "pumping the token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This led to an oversupply of [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] that anticipated future demand which ultimately did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Major, successful [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] have not voiced significant concerns about [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum's L1 scaling]] because they feel secure in their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. John Charbano believes that [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_improvements | ETH L1 scaling]] will not fundamentally change the long-run need for many chains. The current "long tail" of chains often serve similar use cases rather than unique, high-scale applications, making them susceptible to cannibalization by an improved L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Value Accrual and Interoperability

The conversation extends to how [[Ethereums_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | Ethereum's scaling]] impacts value accrual to the ETH token. It's argued that goodwill and energy are poured into building a broad [[the_role_of_layer_1_and_layer_2_in_the_ethereum_ecosystem | Ethereum ecosystem]], but if it doesn't directly drive value back to the ETH token, community excitement wanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Many [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] have their own central tokens, creating incentives that can guide decisions away from directly benefiting [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]] as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This is seen as "death by a thousand cuts" where small tokens carve out market cap that could otherwise accrue to ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

The perspective of viewing [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | L1]] and [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] as separate chains with their own incentives and motivations is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum's]] developers can only defend the main chain's domain; beyond that, projects will act in their own self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Many [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] were likely launched as paths of least resistance to create valuable tokens or companies, rather than for specific technological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## ETH as Money vs. Tech Platform

There are different perspectives on [[Ethereums_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | ETH's value accrual]]. One view suggests that ETH needs to be marketed as a "sovereign money" or "digital oil" to reach higher valuations, akin to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. However, it's argued that a smart contract platform like [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]] cannot simply claim to be money without generating fees from utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Fees provide the "basil level of bullishness," and then the "moneyiness properties" (censorship resistance, decentralization) can be layered on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

John Charbano contends that focusing on economics (like the burn or "ultrasound money") as the core pitch for ETH being better money than Bitcoin is a losing argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Instead, he believes [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]] should win by being the "winning tech platform" where "everything is built on [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. In this scenario, ETH naturally becomes the "most censorship-resistant programmable asset at the center of that ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. He suggests that [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | ETH's]] only shot at "flipping Bitcoin" is through technological differentiation and hoping Bitcoin falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This approach naturally maximizes cash flows from L1 scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

The idea that [[Ethereums_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | ETH's]] price deflation and declining dominance as a smart contract platform (from 90% to 60%) are linked is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. When there's a strong second contender (like Solana), the notion of a smart contract platform becomes commoditized, impacting [[Ethereums_scaling_and_strategic_pivot | ETH's]] monetary premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## The Role of User Activity and "Fun"

Andy 8052, a trader, emphasizes the importance of a chain being "fun" and offering opportunities to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. He moved most of his transactions off [[Ethereums_layer_1_l1_and_layer_2_l2_scaling_strategies | Ethereum]] mainnet and even [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] to Solana after the FTX crash because "there just wasn't really anything happening on ETH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This highlights a user base that is "chain neutral" and follows opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

The demand for a base asset like ETH or SOL comes from its necessity as a "medium of exchange" for "the next cool thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. For example, buying SOL to participate in Pump Fun meme coins creates buy pressure for SOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. This illustrates that a useful tech platform that enables high-volume activity naturally leads to asset appreciation and bullish narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Challenges for L2s: Snipers and Sustainability

A significant challenge for user-facing applications on chains like Solana is the "sniper problem," where bots front-run token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. For Pump Fun, 80% of launches have an initial buy in the same block, and 50% of those end in profit sold within 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. This industrialized front-running makes it difficult for casual users to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

Conversely, [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] typically offer a benefit of "private MEV," which mitigates sandwich attacks and front-running to the same degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Despite this advantage, there hasn't been a significant shift of activity to [[ethereum_layer_2_scaling_and_future_of_bitcoin_layer_2s | L2s]] for this reason, possibly because traders may not be aware of or prioritize these technical benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

The "casino-like" nature of meme coin trading is acknowledged, where people are willing to gamble despite poor odds due to the allure of high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. While the market has seen high-profile blowups (like the Trump coin and Malay coin), memecoin volume remains surprisingly sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This suggests that the current participants are more sophisticated and aware of the risks, treating it as "funny money" or a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

The discussion concludes that while the "rake" in these on-chain games might get "rikier" over time, markets tend towards efficiency. Users will eventually seek platforms that offer better odds or lower fees, but this might not happen very soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

A strong narrative is essential for [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Ethereum]] to be perceived as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This requires fostering "irrational confidence," similar to how gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and [[comparison_of_ethereums_narrative_to_bitcoin_and_gold | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> have achieved their store-of-value status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It is argued that [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum]]'s "ivory tower" approach currently neglects the "meme layer narrative" crucial for establishing a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Core Strategies for Narrative Cultivation

To cultivate this strong narrative, several actions are proposed:
*   **Promote ETH Holding** Encourage everyone to hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Incentivize and Disincentivize**
    *   Shame entities like L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs that do not hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
    *   [[promotion_and_celebration_of_eth_holding | Celebrate]] and reward those who hold ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Encourage Staking** Promote staking, restaking, and auto-staking ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Meme as Digital Gold** [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Meme]] ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Propagate the Message** Utilize various communication channels such as writing, tweeting, podcasting, and "ship posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Elect leaders who champion these messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Simplify Value** Proseltyze that "one ETH equals one E" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Addressing Community Resistance

While the concept of "shaming" may be unpopular within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, it is presented as a necessary tactic for "winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Not all members of the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] are expected to embrace this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on cultivating a contingent of "ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic about ETH, potentially to the point of "laser eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, without necessarily mirroring [[comparison_of_ethereums_narrative_to_bitcoin_and_gold | Bitcoin]]'s "toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The overall [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] narrative needs to be reoriented towards emphasizing ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

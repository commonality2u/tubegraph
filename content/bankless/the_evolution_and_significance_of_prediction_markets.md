## Introduction to Prediction Markets

Prediction markets are platforms where participants can trade contracts based on the outcome of future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:54">[02:50:54]</a>. They function as "truth machines," providing insights and predictions across a wide range of events, often before traditional media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:09">[02:55:09]</a>. For example, during an election, prediction markets can offer real-time data that feels more immediate than mainstream media reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. The CEO of Robin Hood, Vlad Tenev, views prediction markets as an evolution of the news, suggesting that in some cases, news can be obtained through these markets before it officially breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.

## Robin Hood's Involvement in Prediction Markets

Robin Hood has taken steps to integrate prediction markets into its offerings, motivated by a mission to democratize finance for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>. This means facilitating any market where retail investors are interested, ensuring they have a level playing field with institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:52">[02:43:52]</a>. Beyond trading, Vlad Tenev believes there is a societal benefit to having robust prediction markets, as they lead to better predictions across diverse events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Integration and Partnerships
Robin Hood recently launched a prediction markets hub directly within its app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. At launch, customers could trade contracts related to the upper bound of the target Fed's fund rate and outcomes of men's and women's college basketball tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

This product is powered by partnerships with Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.
*   **Kalshi**: Robin Hood partners with Kalshi, a DCM, which acts like a stock exchange in the futures market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Robin Hood operates as a Futures Commissions Merchant (FCM), responsible for the customer relationship and interface, routing orders to DCMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:58">[02:46:58]</a>.
*   **Forecastex**: For the presidential election, Robin Hood connected to Forecastex, a DCM subsidiary of Interactive Brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:25">[02:48:25]</a>.
    *   This demonstrates Robin Hood's capability to connect to multiple DCMs and offer various products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

The DCM is ultimately responsible for listing the contract; Robin Hood, as a broker, cannot offer its own prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

### Future Outlook
Robin Hood aims to expand its prediction market offerings significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:18">[02:58:18]</a>. Having moved from listing one contract at a time to hundreds, they are soon working towards supporting thousands of prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:21">[03:00:21]</a>.

Future categories could include:
*   Economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:54">[03:01:54]</a>
*   [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_crypto_markets | Artificial intelligence]] progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>
*   A "newspaper" model, covering trending global events, sports, business, arts, leisure, and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:04">[03:12:04]</a>.

Vlad Tenev highlights the value of prediction markets for geopolitical events, providing informative insights into the likelihood of certain outcomes in an unstable global future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape and Challenges

Prediction markets operate under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:54">[02:50:54]</a>. A significant hurdle for platforms like Poly Market, which are not DCMs, is their inability to operate in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:09">[02:53:09]</a>.

Market structure legislation is crucial for clarifying how crypto-asset securities and commodities are defined, and what steps platforms need to take to list them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:29">[09:38:29]</a>. This legislation is expected to unlock the true power of crypto technology by integrating it with real-world assets like securities and prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:06">[09:47:06]</a>.

There's a CFTC guideline stating that prediction markets "contrary to public interest" shouldn't be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:24">[03:22:24]</a>. However, Vlad Tenev believes the vast majority of prediction markets are in the public interest, suggesting the need for clear definitions to prevent ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:58">[03:29:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

Prediction markets offer a unique and powerful way to gauge collective intelligence and predict outcomes. As regulatory clarity improves through initiatives like market structure legislation, platforms like Robin Hood are poised to expand their offerings, bringing these "truth machines" to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>. This expansion could cover everything from economic forecasts to [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_crypto_markets | AI advancements]] and geopolitical events, fostering greater transparency and potentially competing with traditional news sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:04">[03:12:04]</a>.

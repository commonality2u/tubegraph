[[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | ETH]] experienced a 50% increase over seven days, surprising many who thought the asset was "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Explanations for Price Movement

The primary explanation offered for the rapid price increase is rooted in human nature, suggesting that "the most hated coin or most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This perspective views the rally as a natural consequence of [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | Ethereum]] being "hated for the last 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, especially while other assets like Solana saw significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This period of negative [[market_sentiment_towards_ethereum_and_its_impact_on_its_price | sentiment]] was particularly acute around March, when the [[comparison_between_bitcoin_and_ethereums_value_narrative | Bitcoin]]/[[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | ETH]] ratio was declining and [[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | ETH]] was perceived as "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Dismissal of Specific Rationales

While some might attempt to "concoct" specific reasons for the price surge, such as the Petra upgrade or [[ethereums_leadership_and_community_dynamics | Vitalic]] becoming "a little bit more active on social media," these are largely dismissed as secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The prevailing view suggests there is "no other explanation" than human nature and the inherent cycle of market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The speaker asserts that one "can come up with any sort of rationale as to why the price is going up," but the underlying factor is the prior period of intense dislike for the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

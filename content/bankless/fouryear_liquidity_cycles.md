Economist Ralph Paul identifies four-year cycles in [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | global liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, often charted using [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | global M2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Current Cycle Phase
As of the current period, [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | global M2]] is in a bottoming zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The preceding few years were characterized by decreasing [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | global monetary liquidity]] across fiat systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A new cycle is beginning, projecting an increase in [[global_liquidity_and_m2_circulation | M2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Impact of Recession and Monetary Policy
In the event of a [[concerns_about_recession_and_macroeconomic_trends | recession]] and subsequent American capital flight, the expectation is that monetary authorities will activate money printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This scenario is generally considered bullish for [[crypto_market_reactions_to_economic_instability | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective on a New Monetary Order
Ray Dalio's essay, "It's Too Late: The Changes Are Coming," posits that the world is on the brink of a new monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He argues that domestic political and international world orders are deteriorating due to measurable and unsustainable fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This shift involves addressing trade imbalances, such as China's dependence on United States debt and the United States' reliance on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This rebalancing is anticipated to cause economic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To alleviate this pain, significant money printing is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, which would diminish the value of fiat currencies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This aligns with a long-standing "Bitcoiner thesis" concerning monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Robinhood, despite its financial services, operates without a banking charter, making it "bankless" in a literal sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While banking charters offer advantages like plugging into the Fed wire system and enabling lending, Robinhood functions as a neutral platform, partnering with banks when banking services are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Current Role of Banks in Crypto

Even large crypto and DeFi protocols currently rely on [[role_of_banks_in_the_crypto_and_defi_space | banking relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The process of converting traditional fiat currency into on-chain digital assets invariably involves a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Envisioning Crypto Banks

The future is expected to bring the advent of "crypto banks," provided there is regulatory clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These entities would operate under specific licensure, ideally with fewer restrictions than those imposed by an OCC national banking charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite potentially lighter regulation, these crypto banks would still be responsible for treasury management and reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Convergence of Financial Systems

Advocates for open markets, a level playing field, and competition suggest that the traditional banking world and the crypto space are more likely to [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | converge]] than diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | convergence]] implies that beneficial aspects of traditional banking will be integrated into crypto, while the advanced [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | crypto technology]] will similarly be incorporated into conventional banking practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

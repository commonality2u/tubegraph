From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The promotion of holding Ethereum (ETH) and the discouragement of not holding it is presented as a strategic imperative to establish ETH as a primary store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach aims to cultivate a strong narrative and collective confidence around ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Strategies for Promoting ETH Holdings

To solidify ETH's position, advocates suggest a multi-faceted approach:
*   **Direct Advocacy** Individuals should be encouraged to [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | hold ETH]] and spread this message to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Incentivization** Celebrate those who [[positioning_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | hold ETH]] and provide positive reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Actions like staking, restaking, and auto-staking should be promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Dissuasion** Actively [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | shame L2s and treasuries and whales and Dows that don't hold ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **Narrative Control** Engage in [[meme_culture_and_marketing_ethereum_as_digital_gold | meme ETH as digital gold]] with yield, and consistently produce content (writing, tweets, podcasts, shitposts) that reinforces this message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Leadership Support** Elect leaders who champion these promotional activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Simplification** Propagate the idea that "one ETH equals one ETH" until it becomes common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Rationale for an Aggressive Stance

The argument for such aggressive promotion stems from a particular understanding of what constitutes a [[role_of_ethereum_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]]:
*   **Irrational Confidence** A store of value is inherently based on "irrational confidence," akin to gold or Bitcoin, which are seen as pure examples of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Addressing Ethereum's Identity** It is suggested that [[challenges_in_maintaining_ethereums_core_identity | Ethereum's core identity]] is "smart" and "ivory tower," leading it to undervalue the importance of a "[[meme_culture_and_marketing_ethereum_as_digital_gold | meme layer narrative]]" in creating a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This perspective views current [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | Ethereum's development and market positioning]] as lacking sufficient emphasis on this aspect.

### Overcoming Objections
Acknowledging that some may object to the idea of "shaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, the counter-argument is framed as a question of "winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Not all members of the [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | Ethereum community]] are expected to adopt this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The objective is to cultivate a "contingent of ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic about ETH, potentially veering towards a "laser eyes" level of commitment, without necessarily adopting Bitcoin's level of toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Ultimately, there is a perceived need to build [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | faith in ETH the asset]] and to [[ethereum_development_and_market_positioning | reorient what we talk about in the Ethereum community towards the asset]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

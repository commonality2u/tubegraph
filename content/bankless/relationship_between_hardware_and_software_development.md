Hardware advancements are considered foundational to subsequent software revolutions, a point described as almost definitional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This perspective emphasizes [[the_role_of_hardware_in_software_evolution | the role of hardware in software evolution]].

## Hardware Precedes Software Revolutions

The premise is that significant leaps in software capabilities and business models are enabled by prior developments in hardware.

### Examples of Hardware Enabling Software

*   **Mobile Computing and Applications**
    *   The creation of the App Store, which facilitated companies like Uber, was directly dependent on the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This illustrates [[the_role_of_hardware_in_enabling_technology_companies | the role of hardware in enabling technology companies]].
    *   The iPhone itself required technologies from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, built upon over 20 years of progress in network and communications hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Deep Learning**
    *   The emergence of deep learning was contingent on the development of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), a culmination of 20 years of hardware progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_custom_silicon_and_software_in_ai | role of custom silicon and software in AI]].

*   **Cloud Computing**
    *   [[hardware_prerequisites_for_cloud_computing | Cloud computing]] relies on the availability of very cheap, commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   The core concept of cloud computing involves deploying distributed systems atop a collection of inexpensive commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   These distributed systems utilize algorithms to manage failures and breakdowns in the underlying hardware in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   This approach offers a significant cost advantage compared to hosting one's own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   The development of cloud computing was made possible by over 20 years of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

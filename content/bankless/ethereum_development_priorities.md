A significant discussion revolves around whether [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_ongoing_developments | Ethereum's strategic pivot]] regarding Layer 1 (L1) scaling represents a new priority or a continuation of existing [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Is it a Pivot or Reprioritization?

Some observers argue that scaling the L1 did not seem to be a priority three months, six months, or certainly a year ago, suggesting a change that could be termed a pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, Anthony Cisano contends that it is not a pivot, asserting that L1 scaling has always been an integral part of the [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]], encompassing stages like Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Hazu's commentary offers a nuanced perspective, agreeing that while [[ethereum_roadmap | Ethereum's roadmap]] may indeed contain numerous items, and L1 scaling was always on the long-term [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] for [[ethereum_tech_stack_development | Ethereum's tech stack development]], the "pivot" lies in bringing this long-term component to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Acknowledging Change and Growth

The debate about whether to label this shift a "pivot" or a "reprioritization" is seen by some as an "ego thing," where there's a reluctance to admit past shortcomings or changes in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The argument suggests that claiming it was always on the [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] might be a way to "save face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Conversely, it is considered beneficial for the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community culture]] to acknowledge mistakes and embrace changes in strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Admitting that things "got wrong" and expressing a commitment to "make things right" by calling it a pivot is seen as a positive step that the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This transparency underscores the ability to evolve and adapt, rather than maintaining an image of infallibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

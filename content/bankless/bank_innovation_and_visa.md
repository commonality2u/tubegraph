## Historical Context of Bank Innovation

Banks have historically struggled with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The most significant innovation attributed to a bank is Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, this development occurred during an era when technological advancements were significantly slower than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Current State of Domestic Bank Payments

Domestically, banks are expected to continue performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Real-time payment networks are either emerging or already established in various jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These real-time payments are designed to be as fast as, and more cost-effective than, blockchain rails for many domestic use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Global Payment Challenges and Stablecoins

Currently, the US is reducing ties with some allies, and there's a global trend towards protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In many countries, local currencies are experiencing inflation, leading to a lack of demand for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Individuals in these regions often seek US dollars, and access to US dollar goods and services like Netflix or OpenAI's ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Paying for these goods through the traditional banking system can incur a tax of up to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, payments made with [[stablecoins_advantages_over_traditional_banking_systems | stablecoins]] do not incur this tax, indicating a regulatory arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Young people utilizing these payment rails desire greater access to US dollars and US dollar-denominated goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A broader macro point suggests a potential future where the number of global currencies significantly decreases, possibly leading to a currency war between major currencies like the dollar, euro, and yuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

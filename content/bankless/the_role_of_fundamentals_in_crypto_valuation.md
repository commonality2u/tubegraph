From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The concept of "fundamentals" in crypto valuation is still emerging, akin to the early days of the US equities market in the 1940s. At that time, ideas like discounted cash flow (DCF) were esoteric, and stocks primarily traded on narratives and "animal spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Similarly, the crypto market is largely driven by speculation, with Bitcoin often compared to gold as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Michael Nato, founder of The DeFi Report, emphasizes a data-driven approach to understanding how value accrues through blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This involves thinking uniquely about valuation, going deep into the data, and focusing on what he calls "real economic value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Defining Crypto Fundamentals

For Michael Nato, understanding crypto fundamentals means:
*   **Data-Driven Thesis** Every thesis starts with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Valuation** Developing methods for valuing these assets that might differ from traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Convergence on KPIs** The market will eventually converge on a key set of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for [[Valuation models for blockchain networks | relative valuation]] of specific assets and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This will likely be a combination of "cash flow" and other crypto-native KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Horizon** Focusing on longer-term time horizons, similar to value investors like Warren Buffett who bought assets cheaply based on fundamentals and held them for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This contrasts with short-term trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The goal is to deeply understand assets, determine fair value, build conviction, and buy and hold for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

## Current Market Context and Indicators

The current market setup suggests a potential "alt season meltup," where more than 50% of new capital flows into crypto assets other than Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This often occurs towards the end of a market cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. The historical pattern of Bitcoin dominance rising and then falling, leading to altcoin appreciation, is attributed to repeatable human behavior and psychological rotation of capital from perceived safer assets (Bitcoin) to riskier ones (alts) after significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

### Macro Factors Impacting Crypto Markets

*   **Shift from Austerity to Fiscal Spending**: Initially, there were bearish signals due to potential austerity measures from the Trump administration, including government layoffs and tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. However, it now appears that fiscal spending will continue, with the budget bill adding trillions to the deficit over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: This framework describes how government finance works, highlighting that a large government deficit creates a surplus in the economy by printing and pushing out money, driving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. The Treasury is currently seen as the primary driver of the market, overshadowing the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.
*   **Outlook**: This leads to a "risk-on" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. While there are short-term concerns like tariff pauses impacting the real economy (potentially leading to a summer correction), the long-term outlook remains bullish due to continued fiscal stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. Policy makers are aware of bond market reactions and are developing strategies like changes to the Supplemental Leverage Ratio to allow banks to hold more Treasuries and "shadow QE" (e.g., Treasury stock buybacks) to manage debt issuance without disrupting the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Legislation**: The anticipated passage of stablecoin legislation is a significant catalyst, currently discounted by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. It's seen as crucial for the broader crypto bill and provides another avenue for the government to issue debt, which could be incredibly bullish for the US dollar and the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. A similar regulatory event in early 2021 preceded a massive ETH price surge and the last alt season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.

### On-Chain Indicators and Momentum

While not strictly [[Valuation models for blockchain networks | fundamental valuation models for blockchain networks]], these indicators provide important context about market momentum and cycle positioning:

*   **Moving Averages (Bitcoin and Ethereum)**:
    *   **Death Cross**: The 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day moving average, signaling that the price has already collapsed. Often followed by a pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Golden Cross**: The 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day, indicating a bullish pattern. This can be a counter-signal for short-term traders, suggesting a possible correction after an aggressive upward move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>. Bitcoin recently experienced a golden cross after a 50% move in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. Ethereum is showing signs of its 50-day moving average making a run towards its 200-day, potentially indicating a future golden cross around $3K ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Holder Supply (Bitcoin)**: This metric monitors where the market is in its cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>. At market peaks, long-term holders (LTHs) start selling their coins to short-term holders (STHs). LTHs typically buy dips and set market bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:00">[37:25:00]</a>. The current trend shows LTHs starting to take profits, indicating early stages of capital rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>.
*   **MVRV z-score (Bitcoin)**: This Glassnode metric compares Bitcoin's market value to its realized value (a proxy for the average cost basis of all coins on the network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations the market price is from the average. A higher z-score indicates an "overheated" or "euphoric" market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:44:00">[43:44:00]</a>. Historically, peaks have seen z-scores as high as 12 (2013-2014) or 7 (2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. Currently, the z-score is around 2.8, suggesting significant room for growth before reaching previous cycle highs, though there's a "law of diminishing returns" where the z-score peaks lower each cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:10:00">[46:10:00]</a>.
*   **ETH to Bitcoin Ratio**: This ratio measures Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin. After a significant decline, it has shown a recent "tick up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:58:00">[48:58:00]</a>. The strong move by ETH a few weeks prior suggests an impending "thrust" in this ratio, with Ethereum likely to gain ground on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a>. This rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum is a key part of the "wealth effect" that fuels alt season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:14:00">[48:14:00]</a>.

## Alt Season Outlook and Investment Strategy

The overall probability points towards an alt season meltup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. However, [[Asset Allocation Strategies for Crypto Investors | asset selection strategies for crypto investors]] will be critical, as the market is more sophisticated and diversified than in previous cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>. Not all altcoins will experience significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>.

Ethereum is expected to be a major beneficiary, given its "hated" status and potential for a significant move against Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>. The market is likely to see a combination of assets with strong fundamentals appreciating alongside highly speculative assets driven by "animal spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.

### Mike Nato's Portfolio Strategy
Mike Nato maintains a disciplined approach to [[Asset Allocation Strategies for Crypto Investors | asset allocation strategies for crypto investors]]:
*   **Cash Position**: Usually keeps at least 10% cash, currently weighted towards 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>.
*   **Bull Cycle Strategy**: Sold some assets into highs (December/January) and bought back into corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>.
*   **Current Allocation**: Bitcoin makes up about 60% of his crypto portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.
*   **Rotating Down the Risk Curve**: Increasingly allocating to riskier assets as alt season approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:47:00">[54:47:00]</a>. This includes:
    *   **Ethereum Ecosystem**: ~19% of his portfolio, including ETH the asset and a "beta bet" on Pepe (a "culture coin" with high beta to ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:58:00">[54:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Solana Ecosystem**: Expresses views on Solana through "beta assets" like Bonk, rather than holding SOL directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:21:00">[57:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Memecoins**: Views memecoins (Bonk, Pepe, SPX6900, Giga) as speculative, risk-on bets for the end of the cycle, not long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. Their analysis sometimes involves fundamental perspectives using on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Celestia (TIA)**: A bet on the Data Availability (DA) space, purchased when depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34:00">[57:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Worldcoin (WLD)**: Considered an interesting speculative bet due to its potential [[The role of stablecoins in the crypto ecosystem | AI]] perspective and the Worldcoin L2's high blob usage on Ethereum L1, despite its low float and risk of inflation from unlocks during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy**: In a bull run, the strategy involves "scaling out" of positions to build a stronger cash position, enabling re-entry into fundamental assets during the next bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. Some long-term Bitcoin holdings will never be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## Deep Dive into MEV and Solana
Research into [[Real Economic Value REV in crypto | Real Economic Value REV in crypto]] continues to evolve, with multiple valuation angles considered. A "triple point asset" concept includes:
1.  **Capital Asset**: Real yields derived from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
2.  **Commodity Asset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
3.  **Store of Value Asset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

Additional elements like GDP contribution, asset security, and "monetary premium" (brand and community strength) are also considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

Research on Solana's MEV infrastructure, particularly how MEV value accrues to SOL holders through mechanisms like Jito, helps assess the durability of this revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. This involves understanding the underlying infrastructure and how it might be affected by developments like private DEXes on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This fundamental research provides conviction for long-term positions, especially for alt L1s, which will be critical during future bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

Concerns among non-American investors about the safety of property domiciled in the United States have arisen, particularly regarding potential capital controls or taxes on foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such measures could lead to capital exiting US shores, a decline in the S&P, and economic repercussions similar to those seen post-liberation day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Impact of Capital Exit on US Markets

The outperformance of American property, stock, and bond markets over the last 30 years has been based on foreigners parking trillions of dollars of export earnings in these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If foreigners begin to withdraw capital, these markets are mathematically expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Monetary Response to Capital Flight

When markets decline, especially the bond market, and volatility increases, the response typically involves printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In the event of capital controls, the Treasury, the Fed, and politicians would need to create policies to provide dollars to replace the departing foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This replacement would primarily be achieved through money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Gold and Bitcoin as a Strategic Trade

The consequence of such expansive monetary policy is predicted to be a significant increase in the value of both gold and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This scenario is considered the "trade" to make amidst a rebalancing of the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The situation is also seen as "the best thing that could ever happen for [[crypto_market_and_investment_strategies | crypto]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

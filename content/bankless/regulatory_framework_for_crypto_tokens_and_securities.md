From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The discussion surrounding the regulatory framework for crypto tokens and securities has seen a significant shift, particularly with the new administration and leadership within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This new approach aims for a more collaborative rather than antagonistic relationship with the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## The SEC's Crypto Task Force

Hester Peirce, an SEC Commissioner known as "Crypto Mom" for her openness to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, has been appointed head of the [[us_crypto_task_force_and_regulatory_developments | SEC's Crypto Task Force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This appointment effectively grants her powers akin to the SEC chair for crypto-related matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The task force, largely composed of experienced SEC staff with additional outside input, aims to develop practical, workable solutions that support innovation while upholding securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>. The task force welcomes input from the public, encouraging submissions via crypto.sec.gov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

### Key Initiatives

The task force has immediately demonstrated its new stance by:

*   **Rescinding Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121**: This bulletin had severely limited the willingness of traditional custodians to participate in the crypto space due to its costly implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Its repeal aims to open the door for more participants and increase transparency by reverting to pre-SAB 121 conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Exploring Retroactive Relief and Safe Harbors**: The task force is considering recommending "temporary prospective and retroactive relief" for token offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This aims to encourage disclosure by entities willing to provide specified, updated information and agree not to contest SEC jurisdiction in fraud cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. This "safe harbor" concept is designed to give projects the "runway" to achieve more dispersed control and remove the existing "shadow" over their legal status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. This temporary relief is intended to bridge the gap until Congress potentially passes legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
*   **Issuing No-Action Letters**: The task force welcomes requests for no-action letters, where staff can provide assurance that they will not recommend enforcement action if an entity follows specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. This mechanism provides comfort and insight into the staff's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. This could be particularly useful for projects that believe their tokens fall outside SEC jurisdiction, like certain utility tokens or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.

## Addressing Industry Concerns

The SEC acknowledges the industry's past negative experiences, particularly during the previous administration's "enforcement first" approach, which led to a "hairball" of [[sec_lawsuits_and_crypto_regulation | enforcement actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>. The task force aims to change this culture by working towards practical, workable solutions that allow innovation without undermining securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

### Collaboration and Jurisdiction

The SEC aims for improved collaboration with other agencies, especially the CFTC, to delineate the line between securities and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>. There is optimism for joint efforts, including potentially a joint advisory committee, to resolve jurisdictional overlaps common even in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is for jurisdiction to reside where it makes the most sense, whether at the SEC, CFTC, FTC, or state level, with Congress making the final determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.

## Crypto Tokens and the "Security" Label

While some tokens will undeniably be securities, especially traditional equity or debt securities on blockchains, the SEC recognizes that many projects aiming for wide, permissionless participation may not fit neatly into existing securities laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. The concern is that applying a traditional securities framework, which often involves intermediaries and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, could undermine the decentralized nature of these networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>.

### [[regulation_of_meme_coins_and_their_fit_within_the_secs_jurisdiction | Regulation of Meme Coins]] and Airdrops

Regarding [[regulation_of_meme_coins_and_their_fit_within_the_secs_jurisdiction | meme coins]], the SEC cautions that their popularity does not automatically bring them under SEC jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>. It's crucial for individuals not to assume an SEC regulatory backstop or government bailout for all crypto activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:04:00">[45:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. Similarly, for airdrops, a blanket statement on their regulatory status is not possible; "facts and circumstances matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>. The SEC encourages entities to submit generic scenarios for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>. It's also stressed that anti-fraud laws apply, and misconduct will be referred to the appropriate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a>.

## Investor Access and Accreditation Laws

The task force and the SEC are likely to focus on [[investor_access_to_crypto_opportunities_and_accreditation_laws | investor access to crypto opportunities and accreditation laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>. Current accreditation laws, which limit access based on wealth or income, are seen as "unamerican" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. While outright repeal might be unlikely, alternatives like education-based accreditation (e.g., community college classes or professional expertise) or tests are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>. The goal is to provide broader access to private markets, possibly through diversified investment vehicles, while emphasizing "buyer beware" for less regulated options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:05:00">[44:05:00]</a>.

## Future Priorities

Beyond immediate initiatives, the task force faces a "mountain of work" covering various areas, including:

*   Broker-dealer custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>
*   Investment advisor custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:19:00">[49:19:00]</a>
*   [[regulatory_landscape_for_defi | Regulatory landscape for DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>
*   Exchange-traded products (ETPs/ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>

The primary focus will be on addressing the fundamental question of whether something is covered by the SEC's jurisdiction early on, as this can simplify many subsequent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>. The SEC aims to foster an environment where builders can focus on innovation rather than navigating complex legal hurdles, leading to a more functional and exciting market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:54:00">[55:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15:00">[56:15:00]</a>.

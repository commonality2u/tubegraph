The trajectory of [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple's]] market capitalization provides a compelling case study when compared to established industries like oil, illustrating how new technologies can create entirely new economic ecosystems.

## Apple's Early Valuation and Perceived Limits

When [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] launched the [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | iPhone]] in 2006, its market cap was approximately $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. At that time, Exxon Mobile was the world's largest company, with a market cap of around $350 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The perceived upper limit for [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]], then seen as a creator of "toy consumer devices," was roughly five times its value to reach the size of the dominant oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Oil was considered the driving force of the world economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Exceeding Expectations Through Industry Creation

However, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] defied these expectations. Today, [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] has reached a $4 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This monumental growth was achieved because [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple created an entirely new industry]] on top of the existing economy, an industry that proved to be significantly more valuable than oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Analogy to Robotics and Future Economic Shifts

This historical precedent with [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] is used as an analogy for the potential impact of robotics. Just as [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]] surpassed the oil industry by creating new value, it is suggested that a robotics company could similarly exceed [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple's]] current $4 trillion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The rationale is that robotics will exponentially expand the workforce by replacing human labor, leading to significantly cheaper productive output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Robots are presented as being much more cost-effective than human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and their widespread adoption could lead to a decrease in the cost of goods due to lower employment costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A robotics company is predicted to aggressively exceed the current perceived limit set by [[apples_market_cap_growth_and_impact | Apple]], as it would be replacing a human workforce at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

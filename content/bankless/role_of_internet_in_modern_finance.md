While it might seem that [[pre_blockchain_internet_finance | internet finance]] already existed, allowing users to log into banks like Wells Fargo and access their accounts online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, this is not considered true [[Internet Financial System | internet finance]] in the context of modern financial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Internet as a Communication Layer

The internet's role in current financial systems is primarily as a communication mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It facilitates the exchange of messages between a user and a financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy
> Just as a pizza ordered through GrubHub is not made on the internet, financial transactions occurring in a legacy system are not truly "on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The internet serves merely as the communication layer to the analog pizza shop, which then cooks and delivers the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Similarly, when a message is sent to Wells Fargo, the bank accesses its own "permissioned silo database" — which is not on the open internet — to execute a transaction and notify the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Therefore, the internet's function is limited to communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Traditional Financial Systems and Data Storage

In current financial systems, ownership of assets resides in internal records rather than on the open internet. For instance, when investing in a startup, the team maintains a spreadsheet documenting the investor's name, investment amount, and equity ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

If an individual owns 100 shares of Apple through a platform like Robinhood, Robinhood maintains a server with a database entry stating "Felipe 100 Apple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Robinhood then works directly with a depository trust company, which in turn coordinates with Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This illustrates the nature of finance existing within siloed databases that only occasionally communicate over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The fourth week of January saw a significant event in the crypto space with the [[introduction_of_trump_meme_coin | introduction of a Trump meme coin]], which had a notable [[role_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | impact]] on the Solana ecosystem and the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

## The Official Trump Meme Coin Launch

Donald Trump's official Twitter account announced the launch of a new meme coin, urging supporters to "get your ticker sign Trump now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. The associated website, `gettrumpmemes.com`, offered options to buy the token with a debit card or crypto, and displayed a Solana contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

This official Trump meme coin, named "Official Trump," debuted with a market cap of approximately $1-2 billion, and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of about $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. It rapidly increased in value from around $2 to $28 in half a day, adding $50 billion to its market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>. This rapid increase was partly due to 80% of the token being locked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

Despite its initial success, the token experienced a significant dump when a companion "Melania coin" was launched, causing the Trump meme coin's value to drop by 55% from $75 down to $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a>. At one point, its [[trump_and_crypto_market_cap_comments | market cap]] was around $75 billion, but after the Melania coin launch, it sat at approximately $36 billion, indicating a loss of around $40 billion from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>.

When asked about the meme coin, Trump stated he didn't know much about it beyond launching it, and that he heard it was "very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:56">[01:50:56]</a>. Upon learning it had made "several billion dollars," he responded, "that's peanuts for these guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

## Solana's Surge

The launch of the Trump meme coin had a direct [[the_impact_of_meme_coin_launches_on_the_ai_crypto_space | impact]] on Solana. The Solana price was observed soaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, and the Solana-based automated market maker (AMM) Radium was up 50% on the week, with Solana itself up 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:07">[09:09:07]</a>.

Google Trends data showed that the keyword "Solana" was set to break highs not seen since 2021, clocking in at three times higher than its 2021 peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>. This indicated a massive surge in interest.

The Trump meme coin launch also led to a significant increase in wallet creation on Solana:
*   50% of Trump and Melania holders had never bought a Solana altcoin before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.
*   47% of buyers created their wallets on the same day they purchased the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   83% of holders owned less than $1,000 of Solana assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.

This event was described as a "historic retail onboarding event" for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>, capturing users and establishing active wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.

## Broader Market Implications

The involvement of a U.S. President in launching a [[role_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] was considered "fascinating" and a potential "peak" in the meme coin market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. Despite concerns about the 80% ownership by Trump's entities, the general sentiment was that this was a bullish development for the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. It was seen as legitimizing the industry and bringing more attention to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

One perspective highlighted the different behaviors emerging on various blockchains, with Trump-associated entities launching an 80% locked-up meme coin on Solana, while simultaneously building a DeFi protocol and buying Bitcoin and Ether on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This [[comparison_of_ethereum_and_solana_in_the_crypto_market | divergence]] in activity showcases the distinct utilities and cultures of the respective blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

The overall sentiment was that the Trump meme coin, despite its [[the_ethical_and_market_implications_of_meme_coins | controversial aspects]] of concentrated ownership, was less problematic than other "nonsense meme coins" launched daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It was considered a "seminal moment in crypto's history," lifting the "discount rate" previously applied to crypto due to fears of it being banned, suggesting the entire industry is "about to rate up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. The engagement surrounding Trump's crypto activities and comments was described as "huge," indicating strong public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:50">[02:35:50]</a>.

Space exploration experienced a period of [[stalled_progress_in_space_exploration|stalled progress]] for approximately 30 to 40 years, which influenced public perception [00:00:00]. Historically, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained stagnant for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 [00:00:13].

## Transformative Shifts in Space Access

A significant shift is underway due to advancements in space technology. [[SpaceX and the future of orbital transportation|SpaceX]], with its Starship vehicle, is projected to reduce the [[cost_reduction_in_space_travel|cost per kilogram to orbit]] to approximately $20 once it is fully reusable [00:00:18]. This represents an astounding 50,000-fold reduction in cost [00:00:27].

Beyond the dramatic [[cost_reduction_in_space_travel|cost reduction]], there is also a massive increase in the sheer volume of material that can be transported to space [00:00:30]. In the past, the amount of payload that could be sent into orbit was severely limited [00:00:34]. Projections suggest that within 10 years, it will be possible to send a million times more material per year into space than was feasible 20 years ago [00:00:36].

## Parallel to the Railroad Era

The combined effect of a 50,000x reduction in cost and a million-fold increase in the amount of material that can be sent to space is comparable to the early [[comparison_of_space_developments_to_the_railroad_era|railroad era]] [00:00:46]. This period saw a transition from hazardous and slow horsedrawn carriage journeys across America, where there was a high risk of death or disease, to the ability to cheaply and easily transport extremely large quantities of goods [00:00:52]. This transformation is analogous to the shift from "horsedrawn carriages to space" to a "railroad to space" system [00:01:17].

The overall sentiment in the crypto market is positive, with significant green across the charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Bitcoin is "over $100,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and the market feels "very bullish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Market Performance

### Bitcoin
[[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] is currently trading at $111,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, having broken through the $100,000 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is up 3.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> this week and saw a $7,000 increase over the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin dominance]] is at approximately 67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, which is higher than it has been in a long time, though it was down on the day of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Ethereum
[[Market Trends in Crypto and Ethereum|Ethereum]] (ETH) is also experiencing an upturn, with its price catching a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Last week, ETH was up 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and this week it is up almost 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. ETH was up 14% in the last 24 hours leading up to the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The ETH/BTC ratio is up 7%, climbing above 0.02 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Total Crypto Market Cap
The total [[crypto_market_trends_and_token_movements|crypto market cap]] is at $3.25 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, threatening to cross $3.3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is close to the all-time high of $3.9 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[Economic and market trends affecting cryptocurrency|Economic Factors and Market Sentiment]]

The Federal Reserve recently had a meeting where Jerome Powell decided to keep interest rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This "wait and see" approach was influenced by rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation, partly attributed to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Despite the Fed's stance, markets are showing bullish signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Inflation is currently around 1.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, but Powell anticipates potential inflationary pressure from tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The S&P 500 is up nearly 20% from its recent low during the "tariff scare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> and is only about 7% away from all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This market performance, despite persistently high interest rates, suggests that growth is driven by fundamentals rather than zero interest rate policies (ZERPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Similarly, the [[Crypto market sentiment and Economic Factors|crypto space]] rising under a sustained high interest rate environment indicates earned success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Gold has reached all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While this can be seen as a precursor to [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] gains, it also signals global instability and uncertainty, potentially indicating a decline in the US dollar and the US economy as a global financial epicenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Gold's rise is partly due to the DXY (US Dollar Index) being down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Key Developments in Crypto

### Apple App Store Opens Up for Crypto
A US district court found Apple in violation of a court injunction, forcing significant changes to its App Store guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This opens the door for crypto by allowing:
*   Apps to have "clean speak buttons" for off-site purchases, potentially stating that goods are 30% cheaper without discouraging pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   Apps to accept crypto payments directly, bypassing Apple's fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   Mobile NFT marketplaces to allow buying and selling of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> (e.g., OpenSea was previously browse-only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>).
*   Apps to gate functionality via NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

This ruling stems from an August 2020 lawsuit by Epic Games (Fortnite) against Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Coinbase's Acquisition of Darabit
Coinbase is set to acquire Darabit, an offshore options platform for [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] and Ether, for $2.9 billion in a cash and stock deal ($700 million cash, 11 million Coinbase shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Darabit currently handles 90% of [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] and ETH options open interest internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This acquisition is one of the largest M&A deals in crypto history and positions Coinbase to compete with traditional finance derivatives platforms like the CME <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### US Stablecoin Legislation
The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, states that the US is on a path to $2 trillion in stablecoins, aiming to be the "premier destination for digital assets" and establish US best practices globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. There is speculation of up to $2 trillion in demand for US government securities from digital assets in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

Tether is planning to launch a US-centric version of USDT to comply with US regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

Current stablecoin legislation includes the "Stable Act" in the House and the "Genius Act" in the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. The Genius Act is seen as more likely to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>, though some Democrats are requesting more provisions for anti-money laundering, national security, and anti-terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

### Trump Memecoin and Legislation
Democrats have introduced legislation to ban sitting presidents from issuing tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Senator Markey stated that allowing presidents to issue tokens creates a "profoundly corrupt scheme" that endangers national security and public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

Donald Trump's memecoin, which promises top holders a dinner with him, has a fully diluted valuation of $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>, with 80% owned by Trump and his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. Many top holders are foreign entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>, including Justin Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, raising concerns about influence buying.

### EU Ban on Anonymous Crypto
The EU plans to ban anonymous crypto accounts and privacy coins by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>, a move seen as detrimental to privacy within the crypto space.

### Coinbase and 402 Protocol
Coinbase is championing the "402" open-source payments protocol, built on HTTP Rails, to enable microtransactions on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. This protocol aims to solve the "original sin of the internet" â€“ the lack of native payment infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. It enables services, such as AI chatbots, to pay external resources using stablecoins for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. This system can utilize USDC on networks like Base, but is flexible for any network or token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

### Stripe's Stablecoin Accounts
Stripe has launched new money management capabilities, including stablecoin-powered financial accounts, in 101 countries, meaning all Stripe accounts now have a stablecoin account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

### Bitcoin OP_RETURN Debate
The [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] community is debating removing the 80-byte cap limit on OP_RETURN, a function that allows arbitrary data storage in Bitcoin transactions (similar to Ethereum's call data or blob space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Proponents** argue that arbitrary data storage is inevitable and OP_RETURN is the "least damaging method," as it avoids polluting the UTXO set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. They believe it would be beneficial for Bitcoin layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **Critics** fear that removing the limit would invite more "spam" and non-monetary data, crowding out financial transactions and burdening nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. They believe "legitimate" transactions are those where the fee is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

### Uniswap's Uni Chain and TEEs
Uni Chain is the first blockchain to use Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for block building, a technology developed by Flashbots and Uniswap Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. TEEs isolate execution from tampering, even by the operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>, enabling verifiable priority-based transaction ordering, which mitigates extractive MEV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This also allows for 200-millisecond sub-blocks, making it feel like the fastest block in crypto (compared to Arbitrum at 250ms and Solana at 400ms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>, offering "killer execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a> desired by institutional traders.

### Charles Schwab Eyeing Spot Bitcoin Trading
Charles Schwab's CEO is considering offering spot [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends|Bitcoin]] trading, with a potential launch in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

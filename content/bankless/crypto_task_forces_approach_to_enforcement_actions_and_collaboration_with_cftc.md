The [[hester_peirces_role_in_the_secs_crypto_task_force | SEC's crypto task force]], led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is taking a new approach to [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | crypto industry]] regulation, focusing on collaboration rather than antagonism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Established on January 21st, the first day of the new administration, the task force aims to make positive changes in the regulatory landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Composition and Goals of the Task Force

The [[us_crypto_task_force_and_regulatory_developments | crypto task force]] is primarily composed of experienced staff drawn from various divisions and offices within the SEC, ensuring diverse expertise in legal and technical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. It also includes a few external appointments, such as Landon Zinda from Coin Center, to provide helpful outside input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. The task force is actively seeking input from the public and industry participants on its approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

One of the immediate actions taken was the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which had limited the scope of entities willing to undertake custody jobs due to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Rescinding SAB 121 aims to open the door for more participants, particularly traditional custodians, to operate in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This move also reflects a commitment to greater transparency, replacing informal guidance with rules that apply to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Approach to Enforcement Actions

The task force is considering recommending actions that provide temporary and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings, particularly for entities willing to provide specified, updated information and not contest the SEC's jurisdiction in fraud cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This initiative aims to encourage disclosure, a significant shift from the prior approach that discouraged it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. The goal is to address information asymmetries and offer a "safe harbor" that provides comfort for projects to make disclosures and achieve decentralized control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

The task force is also welcoming requests for "no action letters," which are staff-level assurances that no enforcement action will be recommended if an entity follows described circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. This offers some comfort and insight into the staff's thinking, especially for projects that believe they fall outside the SEC's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. An example cited is the Flyfish Club NFT case, which might have received such relief under the new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.

Regarding the existing "hairball collection" of [[sec_lawsuits_and_crypto_regulation | enforcement actions]], the task force acknowledges the complexity and difficulty of untangling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Each case must be assessed on its specific facts and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. The previous "enforcement first" approach often hindered policy development, and the current task force aims to change the culture and rebuild trust within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. Commissioner Peirce urges companies to communicate with the SEC, ensuring a culture of finding practical, workable solutions that align with [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | securities laws]] while allowing for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:40]</a>.

Commissioner Peirce also highlights that anti-fraud laws apply broadly, and if the SEC lacks jurisdiction for a case of wrongdoing, it will refer the matter to the appropriate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>.

## Collaboration with CFTC

Commissioner Peirce expresses optimism for improved relations and collaboration between the SEC and the CFTC, particularly concerning the distinction between securities and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. She has a history of working closely with CFTC commissioners, such as Brian Quintenz, on difficult inter-agency issues like swaps and security-based swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

The possibility of forming a Joint Advisory Committee is being explored, in addition to informal ongoing collaborations between staff members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is not to expand the SEC's jurisdiction for its own sake, but to advise Congress on where jurisdiction makes the most senseâ€”whether with the SEC, CFTC, FTC, or state regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. This acknowledgement of overlapping jurisdictions and the need for arbitrary lines is part of the challenge in financial markets, both traditional and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>. The task force welcomes advice on this front to ensure effective and rational regulatory boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>.

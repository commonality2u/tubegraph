For approximately 30 to 40 years, progress in space exploration remained largely stagnant, leading to a misperception of its potential for future exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The cost per kilogram to orbit was [[stalled_progress_in_space_exploration | stalled]] at around $100,000 for about three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Impact of SpaceX

[[spacex_and_the_future_of_orbital_transportation | SpaceX]] is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to approximately $20 with its fully reusable Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents a 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Increased Payload Capacity

Beyond cost reduction, the amount of material that can be placed in space is also drastically increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within a decade, it is anticipated that a million times more material per year will be able to be sent into space compared to two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This represents a significant increase in [[increased_capabilities_in_space_payloads | capabilities in space payloads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Historical Analogy

The combination of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold increase in payload capacity is comparable to the early [[comparison_of_space_developments_to_the_railroad_era | railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This shift is akin to transitioning from hazardous, slow horsedrawn carriage travel across America to comfortable, cheap, and high-volume transportation via railroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The current developments in space are analogous, moving towards a "railroad to space" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

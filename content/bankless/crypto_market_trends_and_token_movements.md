The first week of May saw the [[economic_and_market_trends_affecting_cryptocurrency | crypto market]] in a strong position, with several tokens showing positive movement. Overall, the market is not currently in a bear market [00:03:03].

## General Market Overview

*   **Bitcoin (BTC):** Up 4% this week, trading around $97,000 [00:02:04]. It is slowly grinding up towards the $100,000 mark [00:02:12].
*   **Ether (ETH):** Up 5% this week, reaching $1,850 [00:02:15].
*   **ETH/Bitcoin Ratio:** Stands at 0.19 [00:02:20].
*   **Total [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | Crypto Market Cap]]:** Currently at $3.14 trillion [00:02:27]. For reference, the all-time high for the total [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | crypto market cap]] was just short of $4 trillion, specifically $3.9 trillion [00:02:37].

## Macroeconomic Influences

Several macroeconomic factors are influencing the [[crypto_market_trends_and_analysis | crypto market trends]]:

### Tariff-Driven Recession Concerns
*   Q1 GDP numbers came in at negative 0.3%, missing the consensus expectation of 0.3% growth. This 0.6% miss is largely attributed to tariffs [00:06:43].
*   A baseline 10% tariff is now generally in place across America [00:07:34].
*   The Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessant, has stated that these tariffs are the "new normal" [00:07:34].
*   A next decision point on tariffs with partners like the EU, South Korea, and Switzerland is set for July 9th [00:07:41].
*   A report from Apollo predicts a summertime 2025 recession, stemming from tariffs halting container ships, then trucking demand, leading to layoffs in trucking and retail [00:08:15].
*   Polymarket is pricing in a 62% chance of a recession in 2025 [00:06:13].
*   Recession is generally seen as negative for crypto, as it is perceived as a "risk-on" asset [00:09:04].

### American Capital Flight
*   Signs of capital flight from the US include falling US stocks, bonds, and the dollar, while gold has skyrocketed 33% on the year [00:09:20].
*   This suggests capital leaving the US, which has historically been a global store of value [00:09:32].
*   [[Bitcoin and stablecoin market trends | Bitcoin]] has started to trade more like gold since the tariff announcements [00:12:06].
*   This trend aligns with the long-term crypto thesis of a credibly neutral alternative to traditional monetary systems [00:12:53].

### Increasing Global Money Supply
*   Global M2 (money supply) is projected to be in a "bottoming zone," starting a new 4-year liquidity cycle [00:13:46].
*   In the event of a recession and capital flight, central banks are expected to turn on the "money printers" [00:14:00].
*   This increase in fiat currency supply is considered bullish for crypto in the long term, as it devalues traditional currencies [00:14:55].
*   Ray Dalio suggests a new monetary order is on the brink, with existing fundamental breaking down, implying more money printing to ease pain [00:14:18].

## Specific Token Movements

### Sui (SUI)
*   Sui was the "mover of the week" [00:03:15].
*   Its price rebounded about 40% in April to $3.6 [00:03:16].
*   It fell from its January all-time high of $5.3 [00:03:22].
*   Sui's market cap remains in the top 15, peaking above $15 billion [00:03:25].
*   Its DeFi ecosystem has surged, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) over $2 billion [00:03:33].
*   This growth is driven by high-yield protocols like Aftermath and Steamfy, stablecoin integrations, and Phantom wallet support [00:03:38].
*   Sui is pivoting to [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] DeFi, positioning itself as a Bitcoin defi hub with integrations like Babylon for [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] staking [00:03:52].
*   Sui is also launching its own gaming console, the Sui Play0X1 [00:04:01].
*   Rumors of a partnership with Pokemon on digital collectibles contributed to its price action [00:04:18].
*   Canary Capital has advanced the first-ever Sui ETF with an SEC filing [00:04:35].
*   Sui's fully diluted valuation is almost $40 billion ($37 billion), significantly higher than its $12 billion market cap [00:04:47].

### Monero (XMR)
*   Monero pumped 50% due to a suspected $33 million [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] theft [00:44:33].
*   Stolen funds were funneled through six exchanges and converted to Monero for privacy [00:44:55].
*   This caused Monero's price to surge to $339 before settling around $274 [00:45:05].

### Movement Labs (MOVE)
*   Movement Labs, the team behind the Move layer 2, is under investigation [00:42:29].
*   66 million MOVE tokens were dumped the day after launch, causing a $38 million sell-off [00:42:37].
*   Tokens were loaned to Renee, an entity tied to Web3port (a market maker) and the Movement Foundation [00:42:42].
*   The co-founder, Rushi Manch, who pushed the agreement, is now on leave [00:42:54].
*   Both Movement Labs and the foundation are implicated in using the same market maker to offload tokens, raising questions of insider self-dealing [00:43:00].
*   Movement denies the accusations, claiming they are the victim of the market maker [00:43:11].

## Other Key Developments

### Worldcoin (WLD)
*   Worldcoin is rolling out its Orb in the US, deploying in six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco [00:29:57].
*   This includes "Apple-like" in-person stores for users to get "orbed" [00:30:06].
*   New users receive 16 World tokens upon iris scanning, while existing users get a pioneer grant of 150 World [00:30:11].
*   Partnerships were announced with Visa, Stripe, and Match Group (including Match.com, Hinge, Tinder) to integrate World ID for human verification [00:30:20].
*   The World App now supports USDC transactions through Circle, integrates Stripe for payments, and offers access to Kalshi's prediction markets [00:31:53].
*   The World App is boasting as "crypto's most active application" [00:31:46].
*   Despite its dystopian appearance, some argue Worldcoin is a necessary solution to AI bot propaganda and distinguishing humans online [00:33:55].
*   Worldcoin states it does not store eyeball pictures but only generates a hash, discarding the data [00:34:23].

### Ethereum (ETH) Strategic Refocusing
*   The Ethereum Foundation announced a leadership structure change, with Shiae and Tamas as new co-executive directors [00:19:32].
*   The EF board includes Falcbuterin, Ayamayaguchi, Patrick Stoneger (Swiss legal counsel), and Shiae [00:19:43].
*   Tamas's near-term goals for the next 12 months include scaling the Layer 1, scaling blobs, and improving UX [00:20:35].
*   This shift is seen by some as [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | Ethereum]]'s pivot towards a product-centric roadmap, moving from a rollup-centric to a rollup and strong Layer 1 roadmap [00:21:10].
*   The debate is whether this is a "pivot" or "reprioritization" [00:21:40]. "Scaling the L1" was not previously a prominent priority, making it feel like a pivot to some [00:21:50].
*   However, others argue it was always on the long-term roadmap (Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge) and is merely a reprioritization [00:22:25].
*   Dankrad (Ethereum researcher) proposed an EIP to scale [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | Ethereum]] L1 100x over the next 4 years, warning that the current approach risks [[ethereum_price_surge_and_crypto_market_trends | Ethereum]]'s irrelevance [00:24:34]. He emphasizes that the L1 is the fee revenue driver and moat for DA, and fragmenting L1 liquidity is a losing battle [00:25:53].
*   Vitalik Buterin's personal focuses for 2025 include Layer 1 long-term roadmap (single slot finality, VM statelessness, security, resilience, decentralization), full-stack security/privacy, and "defensive acceleration" (DACK) beyond crypto [00:27:00].
*   Base and Scroll, two major Layer 2s, have reached Stage 1 decentralization on L2B, meaning significant user protections are in place and Coinbase's unilateral control over Base is reduced [00:28:07].

### Bitcoin in American Politics
*   President Trump's executive director stated there is a "space race" among countries to accumulate [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]], viewing it as "digital gold" [00:38:51].
*   Governments currently hold about 2.3% of the total [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] supply, primarily acquired from nefarious actors [00:40:10].
*   Howard Lutnik, the Commerce Secretary, echoed this, stating the administration will treat [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market performance and trends | Bitcoin]] like oil or gold, not a currency, and aims to acquire it as a reserve asset [00:41:59].

### Regulatory Shifts
*   US bank regulators (Fed, FDIC, OC) have pulled back "guard rails" on bank crypto activities, removing the requirement for banks to seek explicit permission before engaging with crypto [00:47:11]. Regular banking oversight still applies, but the path for banks is clearer [00:48:04].

### Legal and Corporate News
*   **Alex Mashinsky (Celsius Founder):** The DOJ is seeking a 20-year prison sentence for Mashinsky, who admitted to leading a fraudulent scheme and pocketing $48 million, contributing to $4.7 billion in user losses. Sentencing is set for May 8th [00:51:39].
*   **Ripple (XRP) and Circle (USDC):** Ripple reportedly tried and failed to acquire Circle for $4-5 billion [00:53:25].
    *   Circle is now going public, and its S1 filing revealed a significant gap in profitability compared to Tether. Tether's USDT market size is 2-3x that of USDC, and Tether is reportedly printing billions daily, while Circle makes $100-200 million annually [00:54:59].
    *   This profit disparity allows Tether significant capital for political influence [00:55:47].

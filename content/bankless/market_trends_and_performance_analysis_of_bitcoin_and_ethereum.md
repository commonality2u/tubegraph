This article provides an analysis of the weekly market trends and performance of [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]] and [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Ethereum]], alongside broader crypto market developments as of the fourth week of January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The discussion includes insights into price movements, market sentiment, and the impact of external factors like political events and regulatory changes.

## Bitcoin Performance and Trends

[[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]] began the week at $11,300 and rose to $14,800, marking a 5% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The market views [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]]'s graph as "pretty strong overall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, driven by what is perceived as the "strongest narrative" and media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

A significant factor influencing [[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]]'s performance is the "Trump effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, with speculation about a potential [[potential_longterm_trends_in_crypto_markets | Bitcoin strategic Reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While some hype is built into the price, it's unclear if a strategic reserve is fully priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The $100,000 level, previously resistance, is now seemingly turning into support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Midweek, [[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]] briefly broke its all-time high, reaching over $108,000 per coin, potentially touching $109,000 on some exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, this achievement was not widely celebrated and was followed by a dump back to $100,000, indicating volatility above that mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Ethereum Performance and Dynamics

In contrast to [[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]], [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] experienced a 3% decline on the week, moving from $3,300 to $3,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This divergence, with [[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]] up 5% and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] down 3%, is considered rare as both typically move in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Historically, [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]] tends to run up and surpass all-time highs before [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] catches up in bull runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Despite hopes for [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] in Q1, it has remained largely stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, appearing "stuck in that same low" or a "constant bleed on the ratio" against [[Crypto market trends and forecasts | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The $4,000 range has proven to be "very brutal resistance," keeping [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] within a $3,000 to $4,000 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

A "biggest mystery" in [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]]'s price action is the stagnation despite hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]] ETF, for instance, has seemingly had no material price appreciation, only volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This suggests that early ICO participants with large holdings might be selling, absorbing retail inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Overall Crypto Market Inflows

Despite the differing performance of [[Bitcoin and Ethereum market analysis | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]], the overall crypto market has seen "gargantuan" inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Over the last week, $2.2 billion flowed into digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Specific inflows include:
*   **Bitcoin ETFs**: $250 million recently, following $800 million, and over $1 billion in a single day (on the 17th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Ether ETFs**: Also positive inflows for nearly 10 days, though not "gargantuan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

These inflows provide a "floor for all of our crypto bags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The total crypto market cap is near its all-time high of $3.9 trillion, currently at $3.7 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Impact of Political and Regulatory Events

The political landscape, particularly the actions of Donald Trump, has significantly impacted [[Crypto market trends and sentiment | crypto market trends]].

### The Trump Meme Coin and Solana's Rise

Donald Trump launched an "official Trump meme" coin ($TRUMP) on Solana, which debuted with a market cap of $1-2 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The coin rapidly surged from $2 to $28, adding $50 billion in market cap in half a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

This event was seen as "fascinating" due to a former U.S. president launching a meme coin from his official account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. However, the subsequent launch of a "Melania coin" diluted the market, causing the $TRUMP coin to drop by 55% from $75 to $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Despite this, it still clocks in at a $37 billion fully diluted valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The $TRUMP meme coin had a profound effect on retail onboarding, with statistics showing:
*   50% of Trump and Melania holders had never bought a Solana altcoin before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   47% of buyers created their wallets the same day they purchased the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   83% of holders owned less than $1,000 of Soul assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

This was deemed a "historic retail onboarding event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> and a "seminal moment in crypto's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, potentially lifting the "discount rate" applied to crypto due to the fear of it being banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Solana search terms on Google are about to break highs not seen since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, indicating a surge in public interest.

### Trump's Broader Crypto Involvement

Beyond the meme coin, Trump's "World Liberty Financial" DeFi project, a fork deployed on Scroll and Ethereum Layer 2, announced strategic purchases including $47 million of [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | ETH]] and $47 million of wrapped [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Furthermore, $15 million of [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | ETH]] from this project has been staked, implying that the Trump family, through an LLC, has governing power over how these funds are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This engagement across various chains and asset types is viewed as bullish for the industry, reducing fear among builders in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

A distinction is drawn between the types of activities on different chains:
*   **Ethereum**: Building a DeFi protocol, buying [[comparative_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum_as_digital_commodities | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ether]], and other crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **Solana**: Launching an 80% locked-up meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

This highlights a [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | divergence]] in how different chains are being used, with Solana capturing users through meme coins and [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]] focusing on DeFi and its "money store value" as a "global settlement layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

### Regulatory Shifts

The departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler is seen as a significant positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Mark Uyeda has been named the acting chair of the SEC, and Caroline Pham is the acting chairman of the CFTC, both being "Pro crypto" figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Hester Peirce is heading a new SEC crypto task force to address past "wrongs" and foster clear guidance and framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. This shift is expected to bring regulatory clarity, allowing U.S. crypto companies to flourish and potentially trigger a "Renaissance era" for building, especially around DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized the need for regulatory clarity on whether assets are commodities or securities, advocating for collaboration between the SEC and CFTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. He also highlighted the potential for millions of tokens to be created, with "every project, every individual, every meme on the Internet" having one, and companies issuing tokens for fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also expressed a desire for the SEC to "rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

Senator Cynthia Lummis is now chairing the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, and Bank of America's CEO states the financial industry is ready to adopt crypto payments once regulators give the "green light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Additionally, OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash have been lifted, a significant win for privacy in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

### Ethereum Foundation Drama and Community Sentiment

Tension has been rising in the [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]] ecosystem regarding the role and direction of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Vitalik Buterin acknowledged large ongoing changes to the EF's leadership structure, aiming to improve technical expertise, communication with ecosystem actors, bring in fresh talent, support application builders, and increase decentralized and privacy tech use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

However, Vitalik explicitly stated non-goals, emphasizing that the EF will not pivot ideologically, aggressively lobby regulators, compromise [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s neutrality, or become a centralized arena for vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. He indicated that those seeking a different vision are welcome to start their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>, and that the decision on EF leadership rests with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

The community has expressed frustration with the EF's lack of transparency and opaqueness, requesting more information on headcount, tasks, and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. There's a perceived "stagnation cultural issue" within [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]], with a need for more urgency and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

The EF's "subtraction mentality"—slowly stepping away from importance for the network's survival—is seen as suitable for the early stages of [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]], but not for the current stage where it faces competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. There's a call for a more "market competitive" organization to guide [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_ecosystem_dynamics | Ethereum]]'s progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>, especially as competitors are actively "ripping our throats out" in the institutional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

A disconnect exists between the EF's "utopian vision" and what users are actually doing on the chain (e.g., meme coins, DeFi speculation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. This "perfectionist nature" of trying to represent all stakeholders perfectly can lead to stagnation, preventing necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. The community feels "forgotten or abandoned" by the EF, which is focused on future users rather than current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

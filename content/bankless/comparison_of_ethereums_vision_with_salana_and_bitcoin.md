## Current Competitive Landscape

Ethereum's competitive position is currently more challenging than it was in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Bitcoin's Position
[[comparison_of_ethereums_narrative_to_bitcoin_and_gold | Bitcoin]] has maintained its growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Its branding as "digital gold" has continued to strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Bitcoin is considered a "special snowflake" by the United States government, exemplified by the existence of a strategic Bitcoin reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This position is something Ethereum should aspire to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Ethereum's Current Challenge
Ether has "lost its moneyiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and has reverted to an inferior valuation category: the smart contract layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This market is crowded, and it's uncertain if Ethereum can effectively compete against faster-moving, more centralized competitors willing to compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Ethereum is currently in an environment where it is not suited to win and needs to shift its competitive focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Grand Unified Vision of Blockchain

Despite current challenges, Ethereum is positioned to lead the [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] that all blockchains are on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This [[ethereum_roadmap | roadmap]] involves building a grand unified vision for the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

*   **Bitcoin** also aims for this vision, as seen with its desire for Layer 2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Solana** is also pursuing this with network extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Ethereum possesses the largest upside if it can execute this unified vision better than any other blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This execution could make its approach inaccessible to both Solana and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The "grand unified vision of Ethereum" represents the largest total addressable market (TAM) that exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The challenge for Ethereum is to reach this potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The cryptocurrency market has seen significant activity and growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors, particularly concerning [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_on_crypto | AI agents]]. This surge occurred even during holiday periods when the broader crypto market was relatively flat [00:11:20].

## The Rise of AI Agent Tokens
The [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_potential_impact_on_crypto | crypto AI sector]] demonstrated substantial growth during the holiday season, with many tokens experiencing a 3x increase from their pre-Christmas prices [00:02:21, 00:02:27]. This growth was driven by sustained AI token movement over several weeks [00:11:13].

Notable movers included:
*   **AI 16z**: This token, associated with the Eliza framework for producing [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | AI agents]], saw a 150% increase in one week, reaching a $2.2 billion market cap [00:10:21, 00:10:54]. AI 16z is based on the Solana blockchain [00:11:10].
*   **Virtuals**: An [[emerging_trends_in_ai_agent_platforms | AI agent Launchpad]] designed to simplify the launch of [[development_of_ai_agents_and_their_market_impact | AI agents]], Virtuals increased by 60% in a week, achieving a $4.6 billion market cap [00:10:21, 00:11:01]. Virtuals is built on Base [00:11:08].

The narrative surrounding AI has gained significant traction, with AI mind share reaching nearly 60% of all mind share, dwarfing memecoins and becoming a "very hot narrative" [00:12:26, 00:12:38].

## Predictions for AI in Crypto
Several predictions highlight the anticipated impact of [[the_significance_of_ai_agents_and_their_future_impact_on_the_internet_and_crypto | AI agents]] on the crypto space in 2025:

*   **Market Cap Growth**: It is predicted that [[future_trends_in_ai_crypto_sector | crypto AI agents]] will dominate the 2025 meta, with their market cap potentially reaching $250 billion. Currently, the total market cap for [[the_potential_financial_value_and_market_growth_of_ai_agent_networks | AI agents]] is $17.3 billion [00:35:01, 00:35:07]. This is seen as a high-upside prediction, akin to the surge seen in DeFi during a previous cycle [00:36:16].
*   **Transaction Volume**: One forecast suggests that [[emerging_trends_in_ai_and_crypto | AI agents]] will account for 10% of all on-chain transactions by the end of 2025 [00:31:31, 00:31:33]. This implies a massive additional consumption of blob space [00:50:33].
*   **Talent Influx**: Tokens are expected to create a gravitational pull for traditional [[emerging_trends_in_ai_and_crypto | AI developers]] from San Francisco and Silicon Valley into the "wild west" of crypto AI, due to the ability of tokens to facilitate permissionless capital formation and community building [00:28:41, 00:29:08].
*   **Top 10 Crypto by Market Cap**: An [[emerging_trends_in_ai_agent_platforms | AI agent platform]] is predicted to enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap in 2025, which would require a valuation of over $35 billion [00:29:45, 00:29:51]. Virtuals, currently at $4.4 billion, is considered a leading candidate [00:30:02, 00:30:10].

## DeFi Performance and Intersections with AI
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) achieved record-high monthly trading volumes in December, soaring to over $462 billion [00:17:16, 00:17:26]. This trend is expected to continue [00:17:58].

The growth of [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_impact_on_cryptocurrency | AI agents]] is seen as a significant tailwind for DeFi:
*   **On-chain by Default**: [[The_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_impact_on_cryptocurrency | AI agents]] are inherently "bankless" and will utilize on-chain decentralized exchange resources rather than centralized exchanges (CEXs) [00:18:05, 00:18:34]. This means that the upsurge in [[the_rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_impact_on_cryptocurrency | AI agent]] activity will largely accrue to DeFi [00:18:47, 00:18:51].
*   **DEX Volume Boost**: [[Emerging trends in AI and crypto | AI agents]] are expected to boost DEX volumes and on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) [00:18:09, 00:18:14].

## Ethereum and Layer 2s
Ethereum's Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem is becoming increasingly competitive. Base has crossed $15 billion in TVL, up 10% on the week, closing in on Arbitrum's $18.6 billion [00:12:50, 00:12:56, 00:13:00, 00:13:04]. Base usage has also shown consistent, steady increases in daily activity [00:13:30, 00:13:41]. This is partially attributed to Base "getting the AI meta tail" [00:13:27].

Blobs, which represent Layer 2s consuming Ethereum block space, have become the top ETH burner in the last seven days, burning 490 ETH, surpassing Uniswap [00:16:04, 00:16:16, 00:16:19]. Blob fees reached a record high, making up 99.9% of Ethereum's daily real economic value over a weekend [00:16:28, 00:16:34, 00:16:37]. Base was a significant consumer, purchasing 40% of blobs [00:16:39, 00:16:41].

### Ethereum Upgrades
The upcoming Petra hard fork in 2025 is expected to include:
*   **Max Effective Balance (Max EB)**: Allowing validators to have more than 32 ETH staked, consolidating validators and reducing messaging overhead, which improves Ethereum's Layer 1 scalability [00:48:05, 00:48:10, 00:48:21, 00:48:33, 00:48:41].
*   **Account Abstraction for EOA Wallets**: Enabling externally owned accounts (EOAs) to function like account-abstracted wallets [00:48:56, 00:49:05].
*   **Blob Throughput Increase**: Doubling blob throughput from an average of three to six, along with increasing call data costs [00:49:10, 00:49:13, 00:49:18].
However, the larger 10x upgrade to blob space, Piras (data availability sampling), is not expected in Petra and will likely be delayed until Fusaka, the hard fork after Petra, possibly in late 2026 [00:49:27, 00:49:41, 00:49:55, 00:49:58].

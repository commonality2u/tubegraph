From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly viewed as a crucial tool for mitigating various existential risks facing humanity, rather than solely posing new threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This perspective, championed by individuals like Reed Hoffman, suggests that AI, even in its current form, can be a net positive for managing global dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.

## Understanding Existential Risk as a Portfolio

Existential risk should not be viewed as a single, isolated threat, but rather as a "portfolio" of diverse dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This portfolio includes:
*   Pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
*   Asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
*   Nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The potential for "Killer Robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

When considering any intervention or new technology, the key question is how it affects this overall portfolio of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## AI's Positive Impact on the Existential Risk Portfolio

Even if AI development is left "unmodified," it is contended that its impact on the existential risk portfolio is profoundly positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This positive contribution stems from AI's ability to provide rapid and effective solutions to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

### Mitigating Specific Risks
*   **Pandemics**: AI is critical for detecting, analyzing, and developing therapeutics and preventive vaccines at high speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. The rapid response capacity of AI is essential for navigating future health crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Asteroids**: AI can assist in identifying asteroids that pose a threat to Earth and in intervening early to prevent potential impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.
*   **Climate Change**: AI offers positive contributions across the spectrum of climate solutions, from accelerating the invention of fusion energy to improving the management of electric grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

### The "Innovation as Safety" Argument
The idea that "Innovation is safety" is central to this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. Just as cars became safer through continuous innovation (e.g., anti-lock brakes, seat belts, crumple zones), AI's safety mechanisms and alignment with human values will be developed through iterative deployment and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This means that accelerating [[ai_and_the_geopolitical_arms_race | AI development]] is not just about progress, but also about building in safeguards and addressing potential issues as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. If technology is part of a problem, it is almost always the best part of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

## AI and Human Agency
The emergence of AI raises questions about [[the_potential_of_ai_to_enhance_human_agency_and_freedom | human agency]] and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. However, the argument is that AI will amplify human capabilities and lead to "super agency" for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This amplification means humans gain agency rather than losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. While the integration of AI may change traditional ways of living and interacting, these changes can ultimately lead to a better quality of life and greater overall societal happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

## The Future of AI
The belief is that the AI revolution is not overhyped and will continue to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>. The cognitive Industrial Revolution driven by AI is expected to bring widespread change, enabling professionals with "coding co-pilots" and advancing various functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. The technology for these transformative changes is already visibly present; it's now a matter of building, configuring, and deploying it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

The prioritization of [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | scaling the Layer 1 (L1)]] is a key discussion point in the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There is debate over whether this focus represents a strategic pivot or a continuation of an existing roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The "Pivot" Debate

Initially, [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | scaling the L1]] did not appear to be a priority even as recently as three months, six months, or a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift in focus has led some to characterize it as a "pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

However, Anthony Cisano contends that it is not a pivot, asserting that [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | scaling the L1]] has always been part of the roadmap, encompassing stages like "Merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Commenting on this debate, Hazu's perspective suggests that while [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | scaling the layer 1]] was indeed on [[scaling_ethereum_layer_1_and_layer_2_solutions | Ethereum]]'s long-term roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the current "pivot" lies in bringing this long-term objective to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

> "Yes you can point to Ethereum's 100 item road map and say look we have been working on all of these things which is true scaling the layer 1 was always on the long-term roadmap for Ethereum the pivot is that that long-term a part of [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_scaling_layer_1_efforts | Ethereum's road map]] has been brought to the forefront" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

### Importance of Acknowledging Change

The reluctance to admit a pivot is seen by some as an "ego thing," a desire to avoid admitting fault or being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This perspective suggests that by claiming it was "always on the roadmap," individuals might be trying to "save face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

It is argued that this denial can be damaging, as it is beneficial to acknowledge mistakes and be open to changing one's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Admitting a pivot because past approaches were "wrong" and committing to "make things right" is viewed as a positive step that the market desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

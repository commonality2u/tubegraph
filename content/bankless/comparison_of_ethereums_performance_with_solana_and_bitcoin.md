## Recent Performance of Ethereum

[[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | Ethereum]] (ETH) experienced a significant rally, increasing by 50% over a seven-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This surge followed a period where it was considered the "most hated coin" or "most hated asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The prevailing sentiment was that [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | Ethereum]] was "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Explanations for the Rally

The primary explanation offered for [[reasons_for_ethereums_recent_price_rally | Ethereum's]] recent price increase is "human nature," suggesting that the most hated assets tend to rise the fastest in subsequent market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The speaker notes there was "no other explanation" from order book analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

While some might suggest reasons like the "Petra upgrade" or [[the_role_of_ethereums_social_media_presence_in_its_price_movement | Vitalik Buterin]] becoming more active on social media, these are presented as potential "rationales" that could be concocted to explain the price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The underlying sentiment was that it was "time" for [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | Ethereum]] to rebound after being "hated for the last 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This period of peak hate occurred around March, when the [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Bitcoin]]/[[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | ETH]] ratio was declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Comparison with Solana

The hate towards [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | Ethereum]] was largely attributed to the rapid rise of Solana (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Solana saw its price skyrocket from $7 to $300, leading many to believe it was the "new new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. During this time, Solana was "running" while [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_updates | Ethereum]] was perceived as "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Comparison with Bitcoin

In terms of performance, [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] has outpaced [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]] at certain points. The [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Bitcoin]]/[[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | ETH]] ratio was falling, indicating [[ethereums_competitive_position_against_bitcoin | Bitcoin]]'s stronger performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Historically, when [[bitcoin_and_ethereum_market_performance_and_trends | Bitcoin]] reached $110,000, [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]] was priced at $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]] is "definitely not performing as well as it could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> in comparison.

## Outlook for Ethereum

Despite its recent rally, [[ethereum_and_bitcoin_market_performance_and_trends | Ethereum]] still has "a long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> from its current price of approximately $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. There is a sense of optimism among "ETH bulls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, with target prices like $10,000 or $15,000 being considered "meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. One speaker remained bullish even back in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, aiming for a long-term price call around $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

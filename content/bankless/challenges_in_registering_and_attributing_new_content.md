The approach to solving the problem of content registration and attribution began by first identifying the problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Outdated Copyright System

The [[current_limitations_of_the_copyright_system | existing copyright system]] is significantly outdated when it comes to keeping pace with the rapid generation of content on the [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Origins and Suitability
The current copyright system originated with the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It was highly effective for media like books, radio, and television because these channels featured very top-down, controlled [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For example, radio producers or labels could easily work with local stations to enforce royalties for music usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Impact of the Internet and AI
With the advent of the [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | internet]], content [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | distribution]] shifted to a peer-to-peer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This led to a proliferation of content creators, and content began to be remixed and shared at an incredibly rapid pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Exponential Growth
> This problem is now growing exponentially due to [[effects_of_ai_on_content_creation_and_copyright | AI]], with petabytes of content being generated daily, if not hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The current [[current_limitations_of_the_copyright_system | copyright system]] is unable to support this new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Need for a New IP System

There is a pressing need for a new [[challenges_of_enforcing_digital_ip_rights | intellectual property (IP) system]] compatible with the speed of the [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This new system must be programmable, allowing any created [[challenges_of_enforcing_digital_ip_rights | IP]] to be instantly registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Furthermore, it should enable seamless licensing and fair attribution when new content is created based on existing works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

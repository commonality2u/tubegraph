The fourth week of January saw [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]] make a significant impact on the crypto space, characterized by the launch of an official meme coin, a presidential pardon, and the appointment of pro-crypto cabinet positions [00:00:56]. This period marked a notable shift in the broader crypto industry's perception and regulatory outlook.

## The [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Official Trump Meme Coin]]

[[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]] "burst through the doors of the Oval Office with a bang" [00:00:57] by launching a $50 billion meme coin [00:01:00]. This [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | official Trump meme coin]] caused Solana to soar [00:01:03]. The tweet announcing the coin came from the official [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]] Twitter account [00:11:30], urging people to "celebrate everything we stand for winning" and join the "very special Trump Community" [00:11:34].

The coin, named "Official Trump," debuted with a fully diluted valuation of around $10 billion and a market cap of $1 to $2 billion [00:12:14]. It quickly surged from about $2 to $28 in half a day, adding $50 billion to its market cap [00:12:22]. This discrepancy between market cap and fully diluted valuation was due to 80% of the token being locked up [00:12:30].

A major factor affecting the [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump meme coin's]] momentum was the subsequent launch of a Melania coin [00:14:14], which caused the [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump meme coin]] to drop by 55%, from $75 down to $32 [00:14:57]. This decision was seen as diluting the brand and "shot themselves in the foot so hard" [00:14:23].

Despite this drop, the [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump meme coin]] still clocked in at a $37 billion fully diluted valuation [00:15:46]. The distribution showed that [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump Collective]] owned entities held 80% of the token [00:16:01], a structure that would typically be criticized as a "grift" in the crypto industry but was largely accepted due to the coin's legitimizing effect and the attention it brought [00:16:12].

The launch of the [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump meme coin]] resulted in a "historic retail onboarding event" [00:16:55]:
*   50% of Trump and Melania holders had never bought a Solana altcoin before [00:16:44].
*   47% of buyers created their wallets the same day they purchased the token [00:16:47].
*   83% of holders owned less than $1,000 of Solana assets [00:16:52].

The [[trump_official_memecoin_and_market_reactions | Trump meme coin]] is considered a "seminal moment in crypto's history" [00:17:03], lifting the fear of crypto being banned [00:17:08]. The [[impact_of_trump_memecoin_and_political_coins | impact of Trump memecoin]] was largely bullish for the crypto industry, fostering a sense that "regulation guards" are coming down [00:17:51] and encouraging more people to enter the space by creating active wallets on Solana [00:17:30].

When asked about the meme coin, [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump]] stated he didn't know how much it benefited him or where it was, only that he "launched it" and heard it was "very successful" [00:19:48]. Upon being told it made "several billion dollars," he famously replied, "that's peanuts for these guys" [00:20:05].

The Solana search keyword in Google reached three times its 2021 all-time high [00:20:36], indicating a significant surge in interest for Solana, specifically attributed to its optimization for meme coins [00:20:48].

## Broader [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | Trump Crypto Involvement]]

Beyond the meme coin, [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump]]'s involvement extends to a DeFi project called World Liberty Financial [00:20:58], which is a fork deployed on Scroll and Ethereum Layer 2 [00:21:02]. This project announced strategic purchases including $47 million of ETH, $47 million of wrapped Bitcoin, and $4.7 million of Chainlink, Tron, and Athena tokens [00:21:14].

Furthermore, [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Donald Trump]] is reportedly staking his ETH [00:21:31], with $15 million of ETH staked to the World Liberty Financial multisig [00:21:39]. The fine print on the World Liberty Financial website indicates that an LLC owned by the [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump family]] (e.g., "fight fight fight LLC") has governing power over how funds are invested [00:22:50], implying direct family involvement in these crypto decisions.

This level of engagement, from meme coins to DeFi and staking, is seen as "great for crypto" [00:23:29], signaling a reduction in fear for crypto builders in the US [00:23:46].

## Regulatory and Political Impacts

### Pardon of Ross Ulbricht
[[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump]] kept his promise by pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder [00:01:05]. Ulbricht, who had been in jail for almost 12 years [00:26:23] for operating the dark web marketplace Silk Road, was pardoned unconditionally [00:26:59]. Kraken exchange donated $111,000 in Bitcoin to Ross Ulbricht to help him land on his feet [00:27:49], and other donations brought his total Bitcoin received to $276,000 [00:30:45]. This pardon is seen as a testament to the power and influence [[cryptocurrency_and_its_significance_according_to_trump | Bitcoin and crypto]] have attained [00:28:40].

### Changes at the SEC and CFTC
Gary Gensler's final day at the SEC was announced [00:31:16], a departure widely welcomed by the crypto community [00:33:13]. Mark Uyeda, a pro-crypto commissioner, was named the acting chair of the SEC [00:31:53]. Additionally, acting chairman Mark Uyeda announced the formation of a new crypto task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce [00:32:14]. This task force is expected to re-evaluate every enforcement action, litigation, and Wells notice issued to the crypto industry [00:32:38].

Caroline Pham was named acting chairman of the CFTC, also a pro-crypto appointment [00:35:08]. This shift means that both the SEC and CFTC, along with the Treasury (which also has a pro-crypto acting chairman) [00:35:15], can now work collaboratively to define clear rules for the crypto industry [00:35:33].

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed hope that this "most pro crypto Congress ever" [00:36:06] will bring regulatory clarity to the US, particularly regarding which assets are commodities and which are securities [00:36:20]. He also highlighted the potential for "millions of these tokens" [00:37:33], with every project, individual, meme, and company issuing tokens [00:37:37].

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, also expressed his desire for the SEC to "rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks" [00:39:57], further signaling institutional readiness for wider crypto adoption.

### Other Regulatory Developments
Senator Cynthia Lummis, known as a "laser eyed bitcoiner" [00:40:49], was announced to chair the Senate banking subcommittee on digital assets [00:40:43]. Her home state of Wyoming also proposed a bill for a [[trumps_crypto_strategic_reserve_announcement | strategic Bitcoin Reserve]] [00:41:05]. The CEO of Bank of America stated that the financial industry is ready to adopt crypto payments if regulators give the "green light" [00:41:14], referring to the FIT21 bill currently moving through the Senate [00:41:18].

In a separate but related development, the OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash were lifted [00:41:36] due to a court decision, suggesting it is now legal for US citizens to use [00:41:47]. This decision is a "huge win" for privacy and a testament to community efforts [00:42:58].

## Overall Significance
The events of this week highlight a significant shift in the perception and integration of crypto at the highest levels of government and finance. [[donald_trumps_cryptocurrency | Trump's]] direct engagement, even if seen as a "grift" due to the token distribution [00:18:00], is normalizing crypto in the public eye. The change in regulatory leadership is expected to bring much-needed clarity and foster innovation, potentially leading to a "Renaissance era" for building in DeFi and other crypto sectors [00:34:59]. This period is marked by the industry's growing power, influencing decisions from presidential pardons to high-level regulatory appointments [00:29:16].

The definition and value of a digital asset are not inherent but are instead socially constructed through collective agreement and narrative [01:23:23]. This shared understanding causally changes the asset's actual nature [01:26:22].

## Valuing an Asset: Two Fundamental Views

Broadly, there are two primary ways to value an asset from a first-principles perspective [00:06:25]:

1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF)**
    *   The asset represents a claim on some kind of cash flow [00:06:34].
    *   This is typically seen with equity-like assets, where a company or smart contracts produce cash flow, and the asset represents a share of that [00:06:39].
    *   This approach is about valuing the asset based on its expected future earnings or revenue [00:07:00].

2.  **Commodity View (Store of Value)**
    *   The asset does not represent any claim on future cash flows [00:07:17].
    *   Its value is based on demand for its direct use, either industrial or as a store of value [00:07:30].
    *   Examples include gold, which is used in circuit boards for its properties (conductivity, non-corrosive, malleable) [00:07:44], and is also held in vaults as a store of value [00:07:39].
    *   Valuation in this view is based on supply and demand dynamics for its physical or digital utility and scarcity [00:07:56].

## ETH: Technology vs. Asset

A crucial distinction for understanding Ethereum is separating "ETH the technology" from "ETH the asset" [00:09:52].

*   **ETH the Technology:** Refers to the underlying blockchain, its roadmap, and its ethos [00:10:44]. The Ethereum Foundation, researchers, and Vitalik Buterin are seen as brilliant for creating a technology that enables decentralized, trustless computation, facilitating innovations like DeFi and stablecoins [01:10:51]. This technology is expected to continue making the world a better place [01:11:40].
*   **ETH the Asset:** Refers to the cryptocurrency Ether itself and how it is valued and positioned [00:00:24, 00:00:27, 00:00:30, 00:10:42]. The asset's price is not necessarily connected to the success of the technology [01:11:46, 01:11:48].

### The Impact of EIP-1559 and Proof of Stake

The transition to [[security_and_consensus_in_ethereum_upgrades | Proof of Stake]] and the implementation of EIP-1559 fundamentally changed ETH the asset, not necessarily the technology [01:19:15, 01:19:22].

*   EIP-1559, which burns a portion of transaction fees, shifted the predominant definition of the ETH asset towards discussions about its cash flows [01:19:22, 01:21:19]. This led to a focus on ETH as a "discounted cash flow" or "price-to-earnings" asset, traditionally associated with equities [01:19:56, 01:20:01].
*   This emphasis on DCF models can lead to optimizing for properties that benefit equity-like assets, which may not be ideal for a commodity [01:20:07, 01:20:16].
*   Focusing on the fees burned through EIP-1559 as a primary valuation metric essentially means focusing on the "floor price" or minimum viable valuation of ETH [02:02:00, 02:09:01].

## The Impact of Social Definition

The definition of a digital asset is not merely a marketing exercise; it is a fundamental, socially constructed reality that causally changes what the asset actually is [01:13:20, 01:13:45, 01:17:18, 01:26:22].

*   **The "President of the United States" Analogy:** If everyone on the planet believes someone is the King of France or the President of the United States, that person literally becomes that figure, gaining associated power and control [01:13:30, 01:13:38, 01:13:50, 01:14:00, 01:23:17, 01:26:17, 01:29:29]. This isn't marketing; it's a profound act of [[coordination_mechanisms_in_cryptocurrency_communities | social coordination]] and agreement on a specific thing [01:14:16, 01:14:21, 01:22:08, 01:22:10, 01:22:31].
*   **The Danger of Incoherent Narratives:** If an asset is defined in a "schizophrenic" manner, with different groups advocating for different valuation models (e.g., store of value vs. DCF), it results in chaos and an undefined asset [01:14:48, 01:15:23, 01:32:32, 01:33:14]. This lack of a unified definition means there is no clear measure of success or coherent strategy [01:33:59, 01:40:40].
*   [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | Community faith and narrative around ETH as an asset]] is critical. For instance, the Bitcoin community has been successful in maintaining a consistent narrative around its asset, largely due to its simple, fixed supply [01:16:03].

## The ETH/BTC Ratio and the "Floor Price" Problem

The decline in the ETH/BTC ratio since September 2022 (when Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake) is attributed not to Proof of Stake itself or EIP-1559, but to the resulting shift in [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | social consensus]] regarding ETH's valuation [01:18:01, 01:19:15, 01:20:56, 01:32:32, 01:37:09].

*   **Shift to DCF:** The focus moved to revenue metrics and discounted cash flows, particularly the fee burn from EIP-1559 [01:22:54, 01:23:31, 01:33:02]. This means the asset is predominantly analyzed by institutions and Wall Street as an equity-like investment in "blockspace" [01:23:33, 02:03:00].
*   **Targeting the Floor:** By concentrating the narrative on DCF, the Ethereum community implicitly directs the asset's valuation towards its "floor price" [02:02:05, 02:08:50]. This floor is determined by the industrial use case of ETH (demand for blockspace, blobs), similar to how gold's industrial use for electronics sets its lowest possible value [01:59:50, 02:01:05, 02:01:13, 02:02:22, 02:03:11, 02:03:51].
*   **Consequences of Focusing on the Floor:**
    *   If ETH is valued primarily by its discounted cash flow, its price could theoretically stabilize around $500-$600 based on current expectations [02:29:50].
    *   Even if the Ethereum technology is widely adopted (e.g., half a trillion dollars in RWAs issued on Ethereum), the floor price (derived from transaction fees) might not significantly increase, as these assets may not generate high transaction velocity [01:08:08, 01:08:52, 01:09:27]. This creates a situation where the technology succeeds, but the asset's price against competitors like Bitcoin lags [01:09:34].
    *   This leads to a paradox: a successful Ethereum technology, bringing the world on-chain, could see the ETH asset achieve values like $20,000, yet simultaneously experience a new all-time low against Bitcoin (e.g., Bitcoin at $2 million) because Bitcoin would have captured the store-of-value narrative more effectively [01:04:21, 01:04:30, 01:04:46, 01:04:52, 01:09:15, 01:19:39, 01:19:43].

## Comparison with Bitcoin's Asset Narrative

Bitcoin's structural properties inherently make it difficult to discuss in terms of discounted cash flows, as BTC holders have no claims on miner revenue or network fees [01:36:25, 01:36:42]. This "superpower" forces its community to focus solely on its fixed 21 million hard cap and its role as a decentralized store of value [01:36:22, 01:53:44, 01:54:11].

*   **Simplicity and Consistency:** Bitcoin's fixed, easily understandable emission schedule (e.g., 6.25 BTC per block, halving) creates a clear, unified narrative for its asset [01:13:12, 01:15:04]. This makes [[comparison_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_asset_narratives | Bitcoin's asset narrative]] easier to coordinate around [01:14:55].
*   **Avoiding the DCF Pitfall:** Even if EIP-1559 were hypothetically implemented on Bitcoin (BIP-1559), it's argued that the Bitcoin community would likely still maintain its focus on the 21 million hard cap rather than shifting to a DCF model [01:25:38, 01:25:57, 01:27:00, 01:36:51, 01:37:00]. This is because the core definition of BTC is not tied to revenue.

## Reorienting ETH's Social Definition

For ETH to achieve its full potential as an asset, a deliberate shift in its [[community_faith_and_narrative_around_eth_as_an_asset | social definition]] is needed [01:20:17, 01:20:56, 01:27:28].

*   **Beyond Marketing:** This is not about superficial marketing but about a deep, shared agreement within the Ethereum community on what ETH fundamentally *is* [01:13:07, 01:15:29, 01:17:17, 01:24:24].
*   **Unified Vision:** The community needs to agree on a unified vision for ETH, which could encompass multiple characteristics (e.g., a "triple-point asset") but must be clearly defined and consistently reinforced by all stakeholders, from developers to ETF issuers [01:22:57, 01:23:04, 01:23:07, 01:23:44, 01:43:00, 01:43:37]. Without this, the asset remains undefined, leading to "chaos" [01:33:14].
*   **Commitment to Immutability:** For ETH to be seen as a commodity-like store of value, there needs to be a strong [[coordination_mechanisms_in_cryptocurrency_communities | social commitment]] that the emission algorithm will *never* change, similar to Bitcoin's fixed supply, even if the total supply remains dynamic [01:11:09, 01:11:41, 01:12:08, 01:14:00]. This contrasts with current discussions about "minimum viable issuance" which treat emissions as an optimizable cost [01:12:28].
*   **Redefining EIP-1559:** The burn mechanism should be conceptualized as an "industrial use case" of ETH, not a revenue-modeling feature [01:39:48, 02:01:50, 02:03:51]. This prevents the community from fixating on the asset's floor price [02:03:51].
*   **Prioritizing Settlement Layer:** Ethereum must be positioned as the "fundamental ledger" and "settlement layer" for the entire crypto ecosystem, not just as one of many chains [00:00:08, 00:48:54, 00:49:11, 01:07:22]. This means discouraging the narrative that it's "nice" for applications to build on other chains, and instead insisting that Ethereum is the ultimate source of truth, with other chains being wrapped versions of assets ultimately rooted in Ethereum [00:49:27, 00:51:14].
*   **Community Cohesion:** There needs to be a greater degree of shared conviction and even "maximalism" about ETH the asset, rather than the "nice, pluralistic, open, big tent mentality" often associated with the Ethereum technology and product development [00:58:03, 00:58:23, 01:47:14, 01:48:19]. This contrasts with the pragmatic approach needed for the technology [00:57:54].

If these issues are addressed, there is significant potential for ETH to achieve much higher valuations, positioning it as a leading store of value alongside Bitcoin [01:04:21, 01:14:04, 01:20:12]. The current situation, where the success of Ethereum L2s and technology might disproportionately benefit BTC (as a wrapped asset on Ethereum) due to the differing asset narratives, underscores the urgency of this redefinition [01:18:11, 01:18:42, 01:19:19].

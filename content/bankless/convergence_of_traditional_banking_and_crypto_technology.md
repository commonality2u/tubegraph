The financial landscape is expected to see a convergence between traditional banking systems and crypto technology, rather than a divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This convergence involves both the integration of beneficial aspects from traditional banking into crypto, and the incorporation of crypto technology into banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Current Landscape

Many large crypto and [[defi_adoption_by_traditional_finance_firms | DeFi protocols]] currently require banking relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. To convert fiat currency into on-chain assets, a [[role_of_banks_in_the_crypto_and_defi_space | bank]] is a necessary part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For instance, Robinhood operates as a neutral platform without a banking charter, partnering with banks for various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Reasons for traditional charters include access to systems like Fedwire and the ability to lend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Crypto Banks

With clearer regulatory frameworks, the future may include [[possibility_of_future_crypto_banks | crypto banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These entities would operate under specific licenses and [[us_banking_regulations_and_crypto_custody | restrictions]] that are ideally less burdensome than those for a traditional OCC national banking charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Such banks would still manage treasury operations and reserves, similar to traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The aim is to foster a level playing field and competition in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Mutual Benefits

The convergence suggests that:
*   **Traditional Banking to Crypto**: Valuable aspects and good practices from the traditional banking system should be integrated into the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Crypto to Banking**: The innovative technology inherent in crypto offers significant potential for incorporation into the banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The Advanced Decline Index (ADI) is a metric used to understand the "breadth of the move" in the cryptocurrency market, similar to its application in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:58">[05:51:58]</a>.

## Definition and Calculation
The ADI tracks the number of advancing assets versus declining assets over a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>.
*   An asset "advances" if its closing price is higher than its opening price for a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:57">[06:34:57]</a>.
*   An asset "declines" if its closing price is lower than its opening price for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:15">[06:49:15]</a>.
*   The ADI is calculated by subtracting the number of daily declines from the number of daily advances, and then adding that result to the prior index value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>.

## Current Market State and Implications
The ADI for the top 100 cryptocurrencies has been in a downtrend since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:28">[05:28:28]</a>. This is a significant shift compared to 2020-2021, when the ADI was consistently rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:21">[05:30:21]</a>.

This downtrend in the ADI explains why "the vibe is off" in the crypto market, despite Bitcoin's strong performance, even reaching $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>. The primary reason for the overall market cap increase has been Bitcoin, with many other cryptocurrencies still below their 2021 all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:43">[06:23:43]</a>.

### Impact on Crypto Industry and Jobs
The performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies directly impacts the crypto industry's job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:43">[09:29:43]</a>. These projects have foundations, lab teams, and development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:46">[09:30:46]</a>. When only Bitcoin shows significant growth, it affects whether crypto companies hire, lay off staff, or increase pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:09">[09:41:09]</a>.

### Relationship with Monetary Policy
The rise of the ADI in the previous cycle was attributed to loose monetary policy and quantitative easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:55">[08:34:55]</a>. Conversely, the current downtrend is linked to the Federal Reserve's continued quantitative tightening (QT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:40">[08:41:40]</a>. The ADI is expected to remain suppressed until QT ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:56">[13:35:56]</a>.

### ADI and [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | ETH]]/[[]]Bitcoin Dominance and Altcoin Market Trends]]
The ADI's performance is closely tied to the [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | ETH/Bitcoin ratio]] and the broader [[state_of_altcoins_and_market_dominance | altcoin]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:35">[11:12:35]</a>. For a true "alt season," the [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | ETH/Bitcoin ratio]] needs to convincingly bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. This bottoming, however, is often linked to the conclusion of quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:03">[12:43:03]</a>. The current market is brutal, with Bitcoin lifting the asset class, but lacking broader movement due to policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:34">[12:47:34]</a>.

While [[market_trends_and_performance_analysis_of_bitcoin_and_ethereum | ETH]] is considered relatively cheap compared to Bitcoin, the overall [[state_of_altcoins_and_market_dominance | altcoin]] market's performance against Bitcoin remains low, similar to how the ADI continues to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:02">[32:31:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:04">[32:55:04]</a>.

## Impact of [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | Meme Coins]]
The prevalence of [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | meme coins]] is seen as a significant factor hindering broader market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:02">[20:37:02]</a>.
*   **Malinvestment:** Investors are flocking to "get-rich-quick" [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | meme coins]] instead of projects with [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | real economic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:02">[20:37:02]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Drain:** [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | Meme coins]] are perceived as sucking liquidity out of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Market Vibe:** The abundance of funds flowing into [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | meme coins]] suggests ample liquidity, which provides less incentive for the Federal Reserve to end quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:48">[23:14:48]</a>. The diminishing duration of [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | meme coin]] pumps indicates a drying up of demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:41">[23:20:41]</a>.
*   **Discouraged Innovation:** The rapid rise of [[trends_and_highlights_in_the_ai_crypto_investment_market | meme coins]] can be demoralizing for developers building projects with [[real_economic_value_rev_in_crypto | real utility]], as their efforts are often not rewarded in the same way as in prior cycles, thereby discouraging innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:01">[52:05:01]</a>.

## Outlook
The market's current state suggests a need for a "big pivot in monetary policy" to see a change in trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:34">[36:17:34]</a>. While the [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_crypto_markets | crypto market]] has a strong fundamental setup with favorable political alignment, the market has not yet reflected this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:02">[45:40:02]</a>. This could be due to a waiting game for concrete policies, such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:47">[47:12:47]</a>.

The industry is seen as having "lost its way" by focusing on "get-rich-quick" schemes rather than building foundational value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:02">[52:37:02]</a>. A potential outcome for market correction involves a period of lower asset prices to clear out "froth and excess," allowing useful projects to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:08">[53:43:08]</a>. The overall sentiment is that the market feels stuck until monetary policy aligns to support broader growth beyond Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:07">[47:48:07]</a>.

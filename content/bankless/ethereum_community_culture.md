Historically, individuals within the Ethereum community have been described as "too nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While this niceness is appreciated, it can be a drawback when defining critical aspects of the ecosystem, especially when compared to the [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Lessons from the Bitcoin Community

The [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin community]] has successfully established clear boundaries, ensuring that [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | BTC the asset]] is [[the_role_of_social_consensus_in_valuing_ethereum | socially fundamentally defined]] as a [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This clarity is reinforced by practices such as shaming those who proliferate too many tokens or incorrectly refer to them as "coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach serves as a [[cultivating_a_strong_ethereum_community_narrative | coordination mechanism]], ensuring a unified message about Bitcoin's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Need for Defined "Red Lines"

For the Ethereum community, it is crucial to establish clear "red lines" or non-negotiable stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The community must agree on what these red lines are to avoid appearing disjointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Importance of Consensus
> If a community is too nice and lacks agreed-upon positions, it risks appearing "schizo" and out of touch with broader developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Without a unified effort to ensure that [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | Ethereum]] is recognized as a [[ethereum_as_a_store_of_value_and_meme_culture | store of value]] and its technology as a fundamental settlement layer, the community risks significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

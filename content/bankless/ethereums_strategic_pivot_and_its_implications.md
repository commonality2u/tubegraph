## Introduction to the Strategic Pivot

Recent discussions within the Ethereum community have centered on a significant [[Ethereums strategic pivot and future potential | strategic pivot]] in its [[Ethereums roadmap and future potential | roadmap]] and overall direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This pivot involves a renewed focus on the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1), even while maintaining a rollup-centric [[Ethereums strategic roadmap | roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Informal researchers and educators, such as 0xBrad and John Charbano, have been active commentators on this evolution and the design choices Ethereum has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Reasons for the Pivot

The conversation around Ethereum's future has shifted, with many now imagining a different trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This new vision emphasizes a stronger L1, reversing a prior trend where the Ethereum community's "sphere of concern" expanded to include anything that touched Ethereum, such as rollups and Layer 2s (L2s), potentially at the cost of L1 focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

John Charbano notes a "vibe change" over the last three to six months, with a full acceptance of existing problems and a need to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This includes a more product-first mindset and technical improvements to the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Organizational changes at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), such as a "leadership shakeup," have been seen as a good way to restart things, with new leadership bringing a different approach to how things are working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The decline of ETH price relative to Bitcoin and other market assets has also been a key indicator that "something is amiss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. This market signal has informed the strategic shift to prioritize L1 growth, users, applications, and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

## Nature of the Strategic Pivot

The strategic pivot, or [[Ethereum pivot and ETH revival | ETH revival]], is characterized by:
*   **Renewed L1 Focus**: Ethereum leadership is now giving renewed focus and attention to the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Rollup-Centric, but Strong L1**: The roadmap remains rollup-centric, but the emphasis is now on building a strong L1 foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Product-First Mindset**: There's a push for a more product-first mindset, identifying specific technical areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Leadership Changes**: Changes in leadership at the EF have helped restart discussions and prioritize L1 scaling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

0xBrad has long called for scaling the L1, emphasizing that "blockspace is not fungible" and "state is valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This perspective believes that prioritizing Ethereum's own block space and state will drive value back to the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Community Reactions and the "Is X Ethereum?" Debate

The community's response to the pivot has been mixed. While the idea of a larger, more powerful L1 is met with positive reception, especially from ETH holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, the discussion around which L2s are truly "Ethereum" has created friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Some L2 leaders felt "hurt" by the notion that certain L2s are "less Ethereum" as they move further away from the L1's core properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This stems from a "squishy semantic political idea" of what it means for L2s to be "Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Layer 2s have benefited significantly from piggybacking off Ethereum's branding and association, being perceived as a "credible great thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A "deprioritization" of this branding is not favored by some L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Implications for Layer 2s

The push for a stronger L1 means that L2s will need to more robustly justify their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. The host suggests that if the L1's capacity expands, it might not equally affect all L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. L2s that lack strong differentiation or a unique reason to exist may "materially lose out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This scenario is likened to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, making it harder for "marginal L2s" to justify their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

The relationship between L1 and L2s is viewed as a spectrum from parasitic to symbiotic to altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. The goal is a symbiotic relationship where platforms charge value proportional to the services provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. If an L1 fails to provide enough value, applications will seek alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

Some L2s may even "close up shop" due to the costs of running sequencers, marketing, and DevOps, especially with the accelerated shift towards L1 prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Examples of L2s that have wound down include dYdX's old version and Aztec, though these were for technical or proof-of-concept reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

The host questions whether building a dedicated chain by an application like Uniswap, instead of focusing solely on its L1 application, might hollow out the L1 and diminish its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The argument is that if the L1 is weak, it incentivizes best application developers to become chain developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

## Comparison with Bitcoin's Roadmap

The conversation extends to [[Ethereums strategic roadmap | Bitcoin's rollup-centric roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The security budget of Bitcoin, which relies on transaction fees as the block subsidy goes to zero, necessitates usage to drive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. It's noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin, until recently, had similar roadmaps of not scaling L1 but exporting to other chains (Lightning Network, Bitcoin L2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

However, John argues that Ethereum and Bitcoin are trying to solve "two totally different problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. Ethereum aims for a multi-trillion dollar valuation, requiring tens or hundreds of billions in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. Bitcoin, conversely, needs only enough fees to prevent a 51% attack, a much easier problem (millions to billions in annual fee revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The value of BTC is largely decoupled from fee generation, as all fees go to miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

Bitcoin is seen as a "special snowflake" due to its inherent user demand to hold and use BTC as an asset, a fundamental desire not shared by other tokens to the same order of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. While Bitcoin also faces L2 challenges, its primary goal is not to solve for "meaningful value capture" but for sufficient fees to maintain security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

## ETH Asset Messaging and Future Outlook

There's a call for the Ethereum community to "stop talking about ETH" as an asset and instead focus on growing the fundamentals of the L1, users, and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. The previous strategy of finding a "one-liner for ETH" to sell to TradFi has not yielded results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. The suggestion is to "market Ethereum as a product to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

0xBrad believes Ethereum's messaging should be focused on its identity as the "unstoppable computer," improving its capabilities while preserving properties like censorship resistance and liveliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

John agrees with deprioritizing discussions about the ETH asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. He argues that markets credit platforms for winning and growing in their respective markets, regardless of strict valuation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. Solana's rise is attributed to the market re-evaluating its probability of winning the smart contract platform race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

## Political and Regulatory Landscape

The conversation also touches on [[Ethereums political and regulatory strategy | Ethereum's political and regulatory strategy]]. The recent affiliation of crypto with former President Trump is seen as potentially detrimental, moving crypto from a neutral technology to a contentious political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. While some prefer alignment with a winning political side, the long-term goal is likely for crypto to be non-partisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

The utility of stablecoins is highlighted as a key factor in improving the perception of crypto, particularly for foreign policy and monetary objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. However, for domestic public sentiment, the onus is on crypto to ship "actual consumer-facing products" that people use and understand, moving beyond the perception of "silly memecoins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Hopes

The current era of crypto is characterized by a "barbell idea" where Bitcoin (as a global reserve asset) and stablecoins (as payments) are very strong at the ends, while the "onchain richness" (e.g., coining content, NFT identity, metaverse visions) in the middle is currently thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

The hope is for the pendulum to swing back towards "onchain richness" as the strong ends of the barbell (Bitcoin and stablecoins) generate more liquidity and volume, leading to exponential growth in the ecosystem's middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. Shipping "basic stuff" that crypto is good at, like money and self-custodial value transfer, will lead to a more serious and globally important role for crypto, bringing more positive sentiment and regulatory clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

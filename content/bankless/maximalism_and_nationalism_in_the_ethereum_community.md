From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The Ethereum community is engaged in a critical discussion about its future, particularly regarding the promotion of Ether (ETH) as an asset and the integration of its layer 2 (L2) networks. This conversation, often termed "Bankless Takes," explores what Ethereum needs to do to "finish the job" and achieve its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## What Ethereum Needs to Do: A Dual Focus

The core challenge for Ethereum is to achieve a future where ETH sits "shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin as the second money to emerge out of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This goal is not about "the flipping" of Bitcoin, but rather about the successful outcome of Ethereum's product stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Achieving this requires attention to both the social and product layers of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Despite recent positive price movements, like a 44% surge in ETH over 72 hours, the sentiment remains that the "job's not finished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The objective is to cultivate a strong Ethereum network and a strong Ether asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, rooted in the vision of programmable internet money and a decentralized finance (DeFi) economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Internal Calls to Action for the Ethereum Community

The proposed solutions are internal to the Ethereum community, focusing on the "social layer" or "layer zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. These "musings meant for the Ethereum communities, not outsiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> revolve around three key calls:

1.  A call for [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | maximalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
2.  A call for nationalism (both Ether nationalism and Ethereum nationalism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
3.  A call for a change in narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Call 1: [[maximalist_approach_for_ether | Maximalism]] for Ether the Asset

While the term "maximalism" often triggers negative connotations of toxicity and close-mindedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, the proposed vision embraces its positive side: an "unrelenting focus and support of a particular asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This call specifically advocates for "Ether the asset maximalism," not "Ethereum the network maximalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

The "blue money gospel" posits that "ETH is good" and "ETH to 10 trillion is good for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Without a strong Ether asset, DeFi and cyberpunk values cannot thrive, and Ethereum cannot be strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

A critique is leveled against the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community culture]] for being weak in evangelizing the value of Ether, focusing instead on bringing other assets on-chain (stablecoins, real-world assets, L2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. There's a perceived "wealth aversion" or hesitancy towards discussing the monetary value of ETH, viewing "number go up" as "dirty stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Bitcoiners, who effectively turned "orange coin number go up 21 million" into scripture, driving its value through evangelism on the social layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

From this perspective, Ether itself is the number one application requiring nation-state level security resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
The prescription for Ether maximalism involves:
*   Talking more about Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   Playing the "ground game" to convince TradFi that ETH is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   Encouraging everyone to hold ETH, celebrating those who do, and even "shaming" (or, preferably, incentivizing with carrots) entities like L2s, treasuries, and DAOs that don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   Memeing ETH as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   Propagating the mantra "1 ETH = 1 ETH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

This approach emphasizes that "belief beats the spreadsheets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Ether should be valued as a global censorship-resistant store of value, not merely based on discounted cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. The distinction is crucial: be dogmatic about Ether the money, but pragmatic about Ethereum the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### A Complementary View: The Product-Centric Roadmap and L1 [[ethereum_development_priorities | Maximalism]]

A slightly different, though complementary, view suggests being more maximalist about the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) while remaining pragmatic about Ether the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This perspective utilizes a "Maslow's hierarchy of blockchain development" with the Ethereum L1 at the foundation, followed by developers/applications, users, L2s, and finally Ether the asset at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

The critique highlights a "wrong order of operations" in Ethereum's past roadmap: building L1, then immediately focusing on L2s, leading to devs, apps, and users primarily on L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. This approach fractured the L1 as the economic hub, severing the positive feedback loop where L1 users attracted devs and apps, leading to gas fees and elevating ETH as a unit of account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The proposed "strategic pivot" or "reprioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a> calls for:
*   **Scaling the L1:** Expanding its capacity by 100x while preserving censorship resistance and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   **Promoting L1 usage:** Encouraging DeFi, tokens, tokenized assets, and applications to remain on L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Tighter L2 Integration:** Encouraging L2s to become "based and native rollups," which are seamlessly integrated with L1, sharing its network effects rather than creating separate ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. This blurs the lines between L1 and L2, making them feel like one unified Ethereum experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

The goal is to restore the L1 as the "economic hub of the internet," where Ether is the default currency for economic activity and asset issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. This provides the necessary product foundation for strong Ether asset maximalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.

### Call 2: Nationalism for Ethereum the Network State

Ethereum can be conceptualized as a "network state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>, but currently, it is "too federated" and not coordinated enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This is analogous to the early United States under the Articles of Confederation, where 13 separate colonies (like 13 separate chains) struggled with coordination and had different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

Today, Ethereum's L2s are seen as a "security alliance" (like NATO members) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>, where they rely on Ethereum's security but can operate with separate currencies and incentives, potentially leaving at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. The lack of a strong "interop standard" or an effective "layer one" means Ethereum "looked ridiculous in the eyes of the nations of the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

The call for "Ethereum nationalism" means fusing these separate chains into a "United Chains of Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a> that feels like "one network state, one nation, E Pluribus Unum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. This entails a shared set of values, with Ether the asset as a focal point for patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

To achieve this economic alignment, L2s should:
*   Hold some of their treasury in Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.
*   Accept transaction fees in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   Center Ether in wallets and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

A stronger L1 is seen as foundational to this, as it increases the L1's negotiating power and makes alliance with Ethereum more appealing for L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The shift to "based and native rollups" is critical, as they are "more like territories of an Ethereum republic" or "states" that share economic upside and use Ether as currency, unlike current L2s that act as separate countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. This transformation from a loose security alliance to a unified network state is crucial for Ethereum's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

### Call 3: [[Cultivating a strong Ethereum community narrative | Narrative Change]]

The current narrative for Ether the asset is considered weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. Ether is not a "cash flowing equity" but rather a "commodity money backed by an economy" and an "index" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. Buying Ether is akin to buying an index of the "Ethereum property rights empire" – the internet economy's property rights layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. Unlike Bitcoin, which is digital gold, Ethereum has a sprawling on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

The [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community culture]] itself is an integral part of the "Ethereum product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. Therefore, messaging needs to change. The community must stop telling people to "get off the layer 1" or that "Ethereum is not for users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. Instead, the message should be that Ethereum L1 is for "absolutely everyone" – builders, users, traders, speculators, and even "degens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

A significant issue highlighted is the community's tendency to "purity test" or "gerrymander support around products or apps or use cases which we find distasteful or immoral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. This moralistic policing of a permissionless network is counterproductive. Examples include ostracizing Lido for its staking dominance or resisting speculation and memecoins, which drove traders and speculators to other chains like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>. Traders and speculators are crucial "bootloaders" for application layers, putting the first dollar into new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

The community should instead focus on exalting Ethereum's unique strengths without toxic negativity towards other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.

## Can Ethereum Still Win?

Despite the challenges, the consensus is that Ethereum "absolutely" can still win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>. While Bitcoin has solidified its branding as digital gold and gained government acceptance, Ether has somewhat lost its "moneyiness" and is currently valued in a crowded smart contract L1 marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

However, Ethereum possesses the "most ambitious vision" in crypto: to become an entire on-chain economy, not just a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. If Ethereum can successfully pull off being a reserve asset/store of value *and* a unified "United Chains of Ethereum," it would be unstoppable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) for such a vision is immense, far exceeding that of mere digital gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

The market currently prices Ethereum at a "tremendous discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Counter-trading this market sentiment presents a significant opportunity, as Ether is the second most likely asset in crypto to become a store of value, and it possesses "incredible assets that no other ecosystem has" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

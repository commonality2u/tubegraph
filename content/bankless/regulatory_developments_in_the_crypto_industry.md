## New SEC Leadership: Paul Atkins

Paul Atkins has been confirmed as the new SEC Chair, succeeding Gary Gensler. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a> He is a Donald Trump appointee and is widely believed to be pro-crypto and pro-markets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a> His confirmation was expected for several months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>

### Background and Stance
Atkins is considered an uncontroversial and stalwart choice, having previously served in the Bush administration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a> His crypto credentials include:
*   Serving on the board of the Digital Chamber, a crypto lobbying group. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>
*   Advising Reserve Protocol, a decentralized stablecoin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>

He identifies as a libertarian, aligning with the views of Commissioner Hester Peirce, who previously worked under him at the SEC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a> It is anticipated that Atkins will delegate significant policy-making responsibilities to Peirce, especially concerning the [[us_crypto_task_force_and_regulatory_developments | Crypto Task Force]], given her extensive experience and the trust she has garnered within the industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a> Overall, the expectation is that Atkins will provide supportive and stable leadership at the SEC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>

## Impact on Crypto Industry Sentiment
The confirmation of Paul Atkins is viewed as solidifying the positive regulatory environment that the SEC has been fostering under Hester Peirce's leadership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a> This shift is considered a complete reversal from the previous administration, where the SEC was seen as the most aggressive regulator on crypto. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a> This positive regulatory outlook is a key factor contributing to optimism for crypto's performance in the coming year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>

You know, like just seeing the complete [[regulatory_shifts_with_the_sec_cftc_and_implications_for_the_crypto_industry | regulatory reversal]], the the positive policy noises coming out of the administration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a> Just seeing the normalization of everything in this industry and more and more companies being able to engage with the space, the growth in [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | stablecoins]], the you know, onchain adoption looks really strong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>

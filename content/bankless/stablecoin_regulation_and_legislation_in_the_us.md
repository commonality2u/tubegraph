The United States is making significant progress in establishing clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, primarily through proposed legislation like the Genius Act. This development aims to modernize the payment system, protect consumers, and reinforce the US dollar's global position.

## The Genius Act: A Landmark Stablecoin Bill

The Genius Act is a proposed landmark stablecoin bill that recently passed a key preliminary vote in the US Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Senator Bill Hagerty stated that the bill aims to modernize America's payment system and put the country at the forefront of innovation, preventing it from being "pushed offshore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. He emphasized the "dramatic new technology" and its incredible implications for protecting consumers in what is currently an unregulated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Key Provisions of the Genius Act

The bill outlines specific standards for becoming a [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | stablecoin]] issuer in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:
*   **Full Backing**: Stablecoins must be fully backed one-to-one by liquid assets, specifically US dollars or short-term cash-like instruments such as short-term Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This prevents "Terra Luna shenanigans" where stablecoins were backed by crypto assets or equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Disclosure**: Issuers are mandated to regularly disclose their reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Bankruptcy Priority**: The bill ensures that coin holders will be prioritized in bankruptcy events, meaning they get paid first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:03]</a>.
*   **AML Compliance**: It mandates Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Eligible Issuers**: Banks, credit unions, and non-bank entities (not limited to financial firms) can be issuers, provided they register with a federal regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Prohibited Issuers**: Large tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google are prohibited from being stablecoin issuers, separating tech from finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### Senate Vote and Bipartisan Support

The preliminary vote in the Senate passed with 69-32 in favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This included 16 Democrats joining Republicans to move the bill forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The bill's passage in this preliminary vote makes it "very likely" to pass the actual vote, which is expected after Memorial Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. If approved by the Senate, it will then move to the House for further changes and expected passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Opposition to the Genius Act

Despite bipartisan support, some opposition exists. Senator Hagerty noted that the opposition comes from "politicians that want to see centralized control" and do not like decentralized concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:60:00">[02:60:00]</a>. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer remained opposed to the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Hagerty argued that a centralized digital dollar would be "devastating for the dollar's value as the reserve currency," whereas the Genius Act would "perpetuate the dollar's value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Implications of Stablecoin Legislation

### Reinforcing US Dollar Dominance and Treasury Demand

A primary goal of the Genius Act is to "ensure US dollar dominance" and advance America's position as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Senator Hagerty projected that by the end of the decade, [[us_treasurys_stablecoin_plan | stablecoin issuers]] in the United States could become the number one holders of US Treasuries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This would stimulate demand for US Treasuries at a time when traditional buyers are showing "tepid demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Impact on Crypto Assets

If the Genius Act passes, it has the potential for widespread adoption of [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | stablecoins]], growing the market to trillions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This could benefit specific crypto assets:
*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Given its large stablecoin base, robust DeFi infrastructure, and institutional rapport, the Genius Act is considered "most positive for ETH" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Approximately $140-150 billion of the stablecoin supply is on the Ethereum layer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Solana (SOL)**: Solana is expected to be "not too far behind" Ethereum in benefiting from the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Tron**: Tron is mentioned as an "ignored dark horse," but its primary use case as a "third world developing country like Stripe competitor" for payments might not translate directly to benefits from increased stablecoin adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### The Role of Traditional Banks

The banking lobby is generally not in favor of this legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This is because [[stablecoins_as_an_alternative_to_traditional_banking | stablecoins]] provide a direct alternative to traditional bank accounts, allowing users to hold an "account balance" with a token contract on Ethereum without needing a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This enables individuals to become "commercial bankless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### The Yield Debate

One area where banks exerted significant lobbying power was in blocking the ability for stablecoins to directly offer yield to holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This means the yield generated from the underlying US Treasuries or other short-term cash instruments that back the stablecoins will likely remain with the stablecoin issuers, preventing direct 5% returns for holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This ensures banks maintain their role as intermediaries for yield-bearing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

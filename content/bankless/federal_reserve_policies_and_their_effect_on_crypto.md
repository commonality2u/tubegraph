The current crypto market cycle has seen the industry, outside of Bitcoin, "lose its way" due as investors flocked to "get-rich-quick stuff" rather than focusing on building value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon, where Bitcoin performs well but other cryptocurrencies struggle, is largely influenced by broader [[us_monetary_policy_and_federal_reserve_actions_in_2025 | monetary policy]] from the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Advanced Decline Index (ADI) and Market Breadth

The "Advanced Decline Index" (ADI) for the top 100 cryptocurrencies tracks the breadth of market moves, similar to how it's used in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. An asset "advances" if its closing price is higher than its opening price, and "declines" if it closes lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The ADI is calculated by subtracting daily declines from daily advances and adding the prior index value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The ADI for crypto's top 100 has been in a downtrend since 2021, despite Bitcoin reaching new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This indicates that while the total market cap has increased, it's primarily driven by Bitcoin's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Many other cryptocurrencies remain below their 2021 all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The ADI for crypto started going up significantly in early 2020 when quantitative easing (QE) returned to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. During this period, known for "good vibes," almost any cryptocurrency investment had a good chance of going up due to loose monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, the current "off vibe" is due to the continued quantitative tightening (QT) from the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Impact on the Crypto Industry's Job Sector
The decline in the ADI for the top 100 cryptocurrencies directly impacts the crypto industry's job sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Foundations, lab teams, and development teams associated with these cryptocurrencies are affected, influencing hiring and layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. When only Bitcoin drives growth, the "economic energy" that supports job security and industry investment for "crypto native" projects outside of Bitcoin diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## ETH/BTC Ratio and Quantitative Tightening

The performance of altcoins and the overall "alt season" are tied to the ETH/Bitcoin ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For alt season to occur, the ETH/Bitcoin ratio must convincingly bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Historically, the ETH/Bitcoin ratio bottomed when QT ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Since 2022, the ETH/Bitcoin ratio has dropped significantly, reaching lows similar to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The market cap ratio of ETH to Bitcoin is also nearing its 2019 lows, suggesting it might be approaching a turnaround point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

*   The ratio of ETH market cap to Bitcoin market cap has historically topped out around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   It typically bottoms around 10% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. It has already reached 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

While the ETH/Bitcoin ratio appears low, its definitive bottom is expected when quantitative tightening ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The end of QT often requires a "scare in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Although ETH did technically "wick into" its regression band a few weeks ago after the Bank of Japan raised rates, indicating a potential low, a clearer signal would be a deeper move into the band, which would likely trigger the end of QT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

> "To get what we want [alt season], we have to go where we don't want to go [ETH/Bitcoin going lower]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>

## Meme Coins, Liquidity, and Fed Policy

The proliferation of meme coins is seen as a sign of abundant liquidity in the market, as investors have "extra money" to throw into these speculative assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This suggests that the Fed might not yet have a strong reason to end quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

However, recent observations show that meme coin pumps are becoming smaller and lasting for shorter durations, indicating that market liquidity may be drying up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This trend could indirectly signal to the Federal Reserve about prevailing liquidity conditions in the broader market, as high-risk assets like meme coins perform against lower-risk assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

> "The FED can't pivot away from quantitative tightening until investors learn to stop pouring money into useless shitcoins. The beating will continue until morale improves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>

The decline of altcoin pairs against Bitcoin (represented by "total three minus USD divided by Bitcoin") also suggests that the altcoin market generally needs to make a similar move to ETH/Bitcoin in terms of finding a bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This overall struggle in the altcoin market is partly attributed to "malinvestment" into meme coins instead of value-driven projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## Solana (SOL) and Market Cycles

Solana (SOL) has been a significant outperformer in this cycle, alongside Bitcoin, largely due to its association with the meme coin craze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. However, the SOL/Bitcoin market cap ratio resembles the ETH/Bitcoin ratio two to three years ago, before its prolonged decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This suggests that if the focus shifts from Solana to meme coins built on Solana, the SOL/Bitcoin ratio might also decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

*   Both ETH/Bitcoin and SOL/Bitcoin experienced initial bull markets followed by an 89% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   ETH/Bitcoin then bled back down after its rally, and SOL/Bitcoin might follow a similar path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

The **[[crypto_markets_response_to_federal_economic_policies | crypto markets response to Federal economic policies]]** is critical. While it's not guaranteed that QT must end for altcoins to bottom (e.g., SOL/Bitcoin bottomed post-FTX without QT ending, which may be an anomaly), quantitative easing (QE) would generally support a broad rally in altcoin pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. The prevailing trend suggests that assets that are going up are more likely to continue going up, making it challenging for underperforming assets to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Market Valuation

Given the current market conditions where Bitcoin has outperformed and altcoins struggle, investment strategies should consider diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

*   ETH is considered relatively cheap in terms of Satoshis (Bitcoin units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   A "modern portfolio theory simulation" suggests an optimal portfolio includes 58% Bitcoin, 12% ETH, and 30% USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. This allocation balances exposure to Bitcoin's dominance, potential ETH recovery if QT ends, and USD for liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Value is generally not found in the meme coin market, as indicated by the "others divided by Bitcoin" chart, which continually declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

Alternative diversification options include:
*   Low-expense ratio index funds (e.g., stock market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   [[impact_of_financial_policies_on_gold_and_bitcoin | Precious Metals]], though they typically underperform risk assets over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   Bonds, for pessimists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

## [[role_of_fiscal_dominance_and_government_policies_in_crypto_markets | Fiscal Dominance and Government Policies]]

The concept of [[role_of_fiscal_dominance_and_government_policies_in_crypto_markets | fiscal dominance]], where government spending significantly influences markets, is becoming increasingly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. What the Trump administration might do with fiscal spending could have a greater impact than monetary policy alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

Donald Trump's stated desire for lower long-term yields (e.g., 10-year and 30-year treasuries) and a lower dollar aligns with his background as a real estate investor (benefiting from leverage) and his goal to boost US exports and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. This approach aims to avoid inflation while improving economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

*   Fiscal dominance (including overall money supply and spending) may better reflect where valuations of crypto assets on their USD pairs are heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   QE/QT, on the other hand, primarily impacts the performance of altcoin/Bitcoin pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

The idea is that if there is high inflation and low unemployment, leading to high wage inflation, people might be less inclined to pursue traditional jobs if they perceive they can get rich quickly in speculative markets like meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. Therefore, reducing demand and increasing labor supply could bring things into a better balance, allowing "useful projects" in the industry to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Market Evolution

Despite current "bad vibes," there's a strong fundamental setup for the crypto industry, including a seemingly pro-crypto administration, potential [[macro_factors_impacting_crypto_markets | macro factors]] aligning, and technological growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. However, the market has not yet fully reflected this positive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

The current market is characterized by:
*   A focus on Bitcoin, with everything good for Bitcoin possibly priced in before the administration took office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
*   Uncertainty regarding a "strategic Bitcoin Reserve" or inclusion of other [[cryptocurrencies_and_bitcoin_in_government_fiscal_and_central_bank_policy | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.
*   The continued dominance of meme coins, which discourages innovation in value-driven projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. The sheer volume of new meme coins (e.g., 52,000 launched in one day on Pump.fun) creates significant supply without substantial market cap, making it hard for true innovation to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

For the market to fully shift, a "big pivot in monetary policy" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. This could involve more rate cuts, with historical patterns suggesting a significant amount of rate cuts (e.g., 165 basis points based on past ratios) might be necessary to trigger a strong altcoin rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

The current cycle feels different because, for much of the market outside Bitcoin, "the cycle just never really happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. While a true alt season could still occur later in the year, it might be more compressed than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. A potential scenario involves lower asset prices later in the year, followed by the end of QE, leading to rallies in previously burdened assets, even if a bear market still follows in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This would allow "useful projects" to grow once the "froth and excess" of the market subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

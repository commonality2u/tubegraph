The concept of stablecoins has been a topic of discussion in crypto since the early days of Bitcoin talk forums, serving as an incredibly important part of the crypto revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While once conceptual, [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | stablecoin development]] has progressed significantly, with assets like USC and Tether growing into a $200 billion market cap asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The performance of blockchains has also risen to match the needs of internet-based stablecoin settlement networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Current Progress and Utility

The [[current_progress_in_stablecoin_development | utility value of stablecoins]] has driven substantial progress over the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Cross-border stablecoin volumes are experiencing 30% month-over-month growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This, combined with [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | regulatory clarity]] from stablecoin bills passing through the U.S. Congress, is creating a "gold rush" in the stablecoin economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The [[impact_of_stablecoins_on_traditional_financial_systems_and_fintech | crypto and stablecoin industry]] inherently promotes interconnectedness, as blockchain networks transcend borders, weaving global financial rails tighter than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Stablecoins as a Foundation
Stablecoins are seen as an inevitability, and businesses in fintech or payments that aren't actively future-proofing for stablecoins risk failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They are expected to be better for many use cases, "eating into" trillions of dollars of the addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Stablecoins represent a first step for traditional finance into crypto, as they become regulatory compliant and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While the total outstanding volume for Tether and Circle is over $230 billion today, traditionally, most of their use cases were limited to trading pairs on centralized and decentralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. However, over the past year, the right [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | infrastructure for payments]] has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Currently, an estimated $50 billion a month in cross-border payments are conducted on stablecoin rails, a volume that was virtually zero 15 months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Diverse Use Cases and Advantages

Stablecoins are not a monolithic product; they serve different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Payment Stablecoins**: Traditional stablecoins like USDC and Tether are designed for payment use cases, often backed by treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Collateral Mobility/Savings Vehicles**: Some stablecoins are better suited for collateral mobility or as yield-bearing savings products, not meant for frequent movement but for treasury operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Examples include Athena's tokenized cash and carry trade or MakerDAO's Dai savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Tokenized deposits from banks like Citi also fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

[[stablecoins_advantages_over_traditional_banking_systems | Stablecoins]] offer clear advantages for:
*   Cross-border payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
*   Payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
*   Providing US dollar access in emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   Use as collateral for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Atomic settlement across different assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

These benefits are particularly evident in cross-border payments, a market valued at trillions of dollars that stablecoins are now taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This rapid growth means that companies like WorldPay, Checkout.com, and Stripe are now developing stablecoin strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Market Displacement

The addressable market for payments is enormous, with $200 trillion in annual cross-border transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Stablecoins are unequivocally better for this use case, provided infrastructure challenges (compliance, liquidity, last-mile solutions) are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The SMB market alone, which constitutes about 40% of this figure, will be better served by stablecoins and stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Traditional businesses like Wise, which targeted a $50 trillion revenue market, could see their models disrupted by stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Wise's business model relies on capital efficiency and extensive connectivity with the banking system, which would be unnecessary on stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This highlights the [[potential_market_displacement_by_stablecoins | potential market displacement by stablecoins]] in traditional finance.

In emerging markets, there is tremendous growth in using stablecoins for savings, with fintechs like New Bank and Revolut exploring their addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. PayPal also has a stablecoin offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. These represent large numbers for crypto but are still small compared to the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape

The current administration's crypto-friendly stance means more [[regulatory_developments_and_challenges_for_stablecoins | crypto-friendly legislation]] is expected to pass through Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Bills like the Genius Act or stable bills in the U.S. and Mika in Europe specifically address "payment stablecoins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Compliance and risk are the primary reasons traditional payments are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Stablecoins offer a regulatory arbitrage opportunity in some emerging markets, allowing for cheaper transactions than traditional banking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Blockchain and Stablecoin Infrastructure

The [[the_evolving_landscape_of_blockchain_and_stablecoin_infrastructure | stablecoin infrastructure]] involves several layers:
*   **Settlement Rails (Blockchain Layer)**: This is the most basic layer, raising questions about whether general-purpose blockchains can serve the needs of large-scale traditional businesses for trillions of dollars in cross-border payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Concerns include prioritization of transactions, MEV resistance, privacy, and stopping memecoin launches that can overwhelm RPCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. Some believe dedicated chains optimized for payments are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Issuers**: Companies like Circle and Tether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Providers**: Essential for efficient currency exchange.
*   **Value Transfer and Money Services**
*   **Aggregated APIs (Orchestration Layers)**: These connect different on-ramps, off-ramps, and counterparties via APIs to facilitate stablecoin transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. They bridge the gap between public blockchains (financial servers in the cloud) and the mesh network of siloed traditional financial servers that provide local presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This abstraction hides the complexity of blockchain from end-users, delivering value without exposing them to the underlying tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
    *   Example: A payment from Brazilian Real to Euro involves pulling capital via Pix, swapping to a stablecoin (often USD), transacting on-chain, and then off-ramping via SEPA Instant in Europe, a process taking less than 15 minutes compared to two weeks in traditional banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Messaging Platforms**
*   **Merchant Gateways and Ramps**
*   **Stablecoin Powered Fintechs and Applications**

For chain design, businesses prioritize liquidity, pricing, application sets, privacy, and reliable transaction delivery over the ideological aspects of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Current trends show that incentives, pricing, and strong business development (BD) teams have driven adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. While incumbents like Tether and Circle have aligned with specific chains (Tron and Base, respectively), they generally avoid fully proprietary networks to prevent alienating existing use cases and chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. New projects are building dedicated Layer 2s that settle to Ethereum to solve specific payment problems with full integration from the chain to the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

## The Future of Stablecoins

### Consolidation and Integration
The future will likely see consolidation across the stablecoin stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. Traditional payment service providers are expected to acquire orchestrators and local ramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. Issuance may also collapse into the orchestration layer, with PSPs like Stripe potentially issuing their own stablecoins or RWAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Compliance is expected to integrate directly at the chain or application level for regulated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.

### Impact on Traditional Banking
Banks, especially regional ones, are slow to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. While domestic real-time payment networks may still compete with blockchain for certain use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>, the global macro environment, characterized by rising protectionism and ineffective cross-border banking systems, will push more international payments to stablecoin rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

Stablecoins, particularly USD-denominated ones, meet a growing demand for access to U.S. dollars in countries with inflating local currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This could pose a significant challenge to local governments and central banks protective of their currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, potentially leading to a world with fewer dominant currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.

### Non-Dollar Stablecoins
Non-USD stablecoins are necessary for foreign exchange, but US dollar stablecoins are expected to dominate market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Long-tail fiat currencies from developing countries will likely exist as "utility tokens" for accounting and local payments, connecting local economies to the predominantly dollar-denominated public blockchain stablecoin networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

### Number of Stablecoins
While many entities will attempt to issue their own stablecoins, similar to the proliferation of Layer 2s, it is expected that only five to ten US dollar stablecoins will achieve real scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. Many will be interoperable, leveraging the same service providers on the back end, but branded differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

### Circle's IPO and Its Implications
Circle's S-1 filing revealed that its revenue model currently resembles that of an asset manager, potentially leading to lower valuations in the public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. The company is perceived as "hamstrung" by its Coinbase distribution deal, which significantly impacts its margins and limits its ability to grow into other distribution partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. However, Circle's IPO will be significant for the market, as public investors will gain a direct way to invest in the growing stablecoin economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

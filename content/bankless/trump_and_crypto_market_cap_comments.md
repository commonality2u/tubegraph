During an interview, a reporter questioned the individual about a [[trump_branded_cryptocurrency | branded cryptocurrency]] and its recent [[value_surge_of_trumps_cryptocurrency | value surge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The conversation highlighted a misunderstanding between the concepts of a single coin's price and its overall market capitalization.

## Value Surge and Dinner Invitation

The value of the coin reportedly surged after an announcement that top holders would be invited to have dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The surge was noted at 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

A reporter struggled to ascertain the current value or market cap of the cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Initial figures mentioned included 14.32 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, although this was clarified to be dollars per cryptocurrency rather than a total market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The [[introduction_of_trump_meme_coin | memecoin's value]] was cited to have hit a peak of $7535 on January 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Confusion Over Terminology

There was a clear struggle by the reporter to grasp the concept of market capitalization versus the price of a single unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The interviewer attempted to prompt the individual to state the multi-billion dollar market cap, fearing that hearing such a number might suggest profiting from the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> "The memecoin's value hit a peak of 7535 on January 19th. That doesn't mean anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
>
> "I mean, what is the amount? The memecoin's value hit a peak of 7535 on January 19th." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

The individual denied profiting from anything, stating the initiative began long before the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The fully diluted valuation of the [[impact_of_market_valuations_and_crypto_assets | Trump-associated cryptocurrency]] was later stated to be $12.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The reporter's attempts to elicit this figure were noted as an attempt to "bait" the individual into confirming the $12 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Stance on Crypto

Despite the financial discussion, the individual maintained a positive stance on cryptocurrency:

> "Look, I'm in favor of crypto." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
>
> "I want crypto. I think crypto is important because if we don't do it, China's going to [do it]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

[[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | Robin Hood]] currently operates without a banking charter, positioning itself as a [[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | bankless]] entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The company explicitly states, "we are [[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | bankless]]. We don't have a banking charter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Current Partnership Model

Despite its [[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | bankless]] status, [[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | Robin Hood]] maintains a neutral platform and partners with banks when banking services are required for various functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach allows [[robinhoods_bankless_status_and_future | Robin Hood]] to offer services that might otherwise necessitate a banking charter, which typically allows for functionalities like plugging into Fed wire, accessing the system, and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Role of Banks in Crypto and DeFi

Many significant [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | crypto]] and [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | DeFi]] protocols still rely on banking relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Banks play a crucial role in the process of converting fiat currency into on-chain assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Convergence

The future may see the emergence of [[possibility_of_future_crypto_banks | crypto banks]], which would be licensed financial institutions with specific restrictions, potentially less onerous than traditional OCC national banking charters, but still responsible for treasury management and reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

There is an expectation that the traditional banking and [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | crypto]] worlds are likely to [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | converge]] rather than diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | convergence]] would involve incorporating beneficial aspects of the [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | traditional banking system]] into [[robinhoods_role_in_the_crypto_and_finance_industry | crypto]], and integrating valuable [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | crypto technology]] into the [[convergence_of_traditional_banking_and_crypto_technology | banking]] sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

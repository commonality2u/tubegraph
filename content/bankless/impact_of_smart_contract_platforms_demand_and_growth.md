The debate around the valuation of smart contract platforms and their native assets often centers on "REV," or Real Economic Value. This term, as used in recent discussions, refers to all network fees and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips that users pay on a given blockchain network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. It functions as a value capture metric, analogous to a traditional company's top-line revenue, which token holders are entitled to receive in some form (e.g., burn, dividend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Additionally, REV serves as a demand indicator, explicitly showing what users are willing to pay to utilize a network's blockspace, excluding application-level fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## REV and Valuation Debates

A key observation triggering recent discussions is the historical correlation between a network's REV and its native token's all-time high price. For instance, both [[Ethereum price surge and market dynamics | Ethereum]] (ETH) in late 2021 and Solana (SOL) in early 2024 traded at similar multiples to their annualized REV at their peak prices, which also coincided with their all-time highs in REV generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This suggests either a rational market where price reflects utility and fee generation, or simply a correlation where on-chain activity (and thus fees) naturally surges during bull markets when prices are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The broader conversation highlights the nascent state of crypto valuation models. Unlike traditional equities with established metrics like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), the crypto industry is still coalescing around how to quantify the value of blockchain assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. While REV represents a minimum intrinsic value (cash flow generation), many large crypto assets remain "divorced" from strict cash flow-based valuations, implying that other factors are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

### Distinguishing REV from Other Metrics
It's crucial to differentiate this "Real Economic Value" from "Realized Extractable Value" (REV), a term previously used by Flashbots, which focuses on the captured subset of MEV rather than overall network fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The current definition of REV includes base fees, which historically account for the majority of [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum's]] REV, unlike the Flashbots definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Chain-Specific Dynamics

The significance of REV varies across different smart contract platforms. For [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Bitcoin]], REV is largely irrelevant for its valuation, as its primary value lies in its monetary properties and store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. However, for smart contracting platforms, the utility value of blockspace makes REV much more pertinent to a chain's total valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### Ethereum vs. Solana
The debate often exposes "tribal lines" in the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. Solana tends to be more dominantly valued by REV due to its optimization for rapid state transitions and high-speed trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. Its design prioritizes "changing state very quickly, very efficiently," making REV a more direct indicator of its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>.

In contrast, [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum]] has historically prioritized "holding state" and long-term verifiability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. While more REV is always "more good" for any ecosystem, its importance is somewhat diminished for [[Challenges and opportunities for Ethereum as an economic hub | Ethereum]] compared to Solana, as [[Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics | Ethereum]] possesses properties akin to Bitcoin's "special snowflake" monetary characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>. There's a push within the [[Challenges and opportunities for Ethereum as an economic hub | Ethereum]] community to increase its REV by lowering block times and emphasizing its Layer 1 as an economic hub for asset trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.

The market currently values [[Ethereum price surge and market dynamics | Ethereum]] at a significantly higher multiple than Solana, even as Solana shows more "growth" in user and developer adoption, especially in areas like memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>. This suggests investors are betting on the "gap closing" between their valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:00">[51:36:00]</a>.

## The Role of Applications and Abstraction

Network-level fees (REV) are distinct from app-level fees. A blockchain could have thriving applications with high user engagement, but if those apps capture most of the value, the REV flowing to the Layer 1 (L1) might approach zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. This raises a critical question: if applications become extremely successful and internalize their fees, leading to lower L1 REV, is it bullish or bearish for the native L1 token? Currently, the market views L1 REV as a component, but not the sole determinant, of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

### Abstraction and Native Assets
User behavior also impacts native asset demand. During "crypto-native onchain fervors" like NFT summer or DeFi summer, the L1 asset often becomes the primary unit of account, driving demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. For example, ETH was money for NFTs, and SOL was money for memecoins, contributing to their peak REV numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

However, the future might see increasing abstraction, where users primarily interact with stablecoins (like USDC) or other abstracted layers without directly holding or transacting in the native L1 asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. While "trench" users (developers, early adopters) might prefer native assets for optimal execution, abstracted users might experience transactions in fiat denominations through user-friendly interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. This could erode the "moneyiness" properties of native L1 assets if pools are no longer denominated in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

The impact of real-world assets (RWAs) coming on-chain is another unknown. While $150 billion in stablecoins on [[Ethereum price surge and market dynamics | Ethereum]] had a "lackluster response" for the ETH asset, tokenized equities or more sophisticated RWAs might behave differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

## Future Trends and [[Competitive dynamics in DeFi and cryptocurrency platforms | Competitive Dynamics]]

The expectation is that REV will matter more for the majority of large assets going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. This implies a shift towards [[Competitive dynamics in DeFi and cryptocurrency platforms | competitive dynamics]] that emphasize speed and revenue generation for newer L1s, potentially leading to a "long tail" of L1s more focused on REV than on the "layer 1 premium" (like Bitcoin's supply sinks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>.

### Challenges for L1s
*   **App Internalization of Value**: Apps will increasingly seek to internalize value, leading to more efficient AMM designs, better liquidations, and app sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. This will likely compress the margins of REV that flows to the L1, shifting bargaining power towards applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>. If L1s cannot adapt, apps might even launch their own chains.
*   **Sustainable Revenue Sources**: High congestion fees (base fees) are unlikely to be a sustainable source of demand for L1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:00]</a>. The future of L1 REV is more likely to come from access to "contentious state," priority fees, and MEV, which are what Solana currently relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:06:00">[54:06:00]</a>. Massive scale (e.g., millions of TPS from [[Development and adoption of AI agent platforms | AI agents]] doing micropayments) might make base fees viable, but in current conditions, they don't support significant DCF valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>.

This perspective suggests a "bearish" outlook for L1 infrastructure (in terms of direct value capture) but a "bullish" one for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:03:00">[57:03:00]</a>. The focus shifts to building the "best execution environments" that cater to fast, cheap, and real-time experiences, whether for traders, gaming, or other consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

### Current Market Activity
The ongoing launch of a high volume of tokens, particularly through platforms like Pump Fun, demonstrates significant on-chain activity and demand, primarily for memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. While the success rate of these tokens is very low (less than 1% for Pump Fun), it shows continuous experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>. Other platforms, like Belief, are attempting a more curated approach, working with teams to associate tokens with actual application value and potentially integrating token burning with revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>. This move towards linking tokens to app value represents an effort to create more sustainable demand, especially given the current regulatory environment regarding tokenized securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

From: [[bankless]] <br/> 

The value of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]] (ETH) as an asset is fundamentally shaped by social consensus, rather than solely by its technological utility or traditional financial metrics. This perspective argues that the collective agreement on [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]]'s definition causally impacts its actual value [01:23:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

## Social Consensus as a Causal Force

The argument posits that the social definition of an asset is more fundamental than mere marketing or branding [01:13:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. If enough people believe something to be true about an asset, it becomes true, impacting its functionality and value [01:13:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. This concept is likened to the shared belief in a president's authority or a king's rule, which are entirely socially constructed roles that yield real-world power and consequences [01:13:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. For a digital asset like [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]], which is "zeros and ones" and cannot be physically consumed or built with, its entire existence and value are socially constructed [01:17:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

A lack of unified social consensus on [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]]'s nature leads to "chaos" and confusion, ultimately hindering its valuation [01:15:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

## Two Ways to Value an Asset

Broadly, there are two primary frameworks for valuing an asset [00:06:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:

1.  **Fundamentals View (Discounted Cash Flow - DCF):** This view treats an asset as equity-like, representing a claim on future cash flows generated by an underlying entity or system [00:06:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
2.  **Commodity View:** This view asserts that an asset does not represent a claim on future cash flows but is valued based on demand, industrial use cases, or its role as a [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] [00:07:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Gold is a prime example of a commodity valued for its industrial utility and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] properties [00:07:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

While mixtures of these views can exist, they often necessitate mutually exclusive properties for optimization [00:20:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## [[eip1559_and_its_impact_on_ethereum_valuation | EIP-1559]] and Proof of Stake's Impact

The transition of [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum]] to [[ethereums_consensus_layer_and_validator_changes | Proof of Stake]] and the implementation of [[eip1559_and_its_impact_on_ethereum_valuation | EIP-1559]] fundamentally shifted the public and institutional perception of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] the asset [00:19:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

*   **Shift to DCF Focus:** [[eip1559_and_its_impact_on_ethereum_valuation | EIP-1559]], which burns a portion of transaction fees, inadvertently emphasized [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] as a DCF asset, focusing discussions on its "cash flows" (fees and burns) [00:19:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. This focus on DCF, which represents the "floor price" or minimum value, can unintentionally anchor the asset's perceived value lower [00:29:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Comparison with Bitcoin:** Bitcoin, by its very nature, lacks a clear DCF model (e.g., no fee burning that benefits token holders directly in a way that suggests a claim on cash flows) [00:36:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. This structural characteristic implicitly forces the [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin community]] to coordinate around its identity as a digital commodity and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] [00:37:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **ETH-BTC Ratio Decline:** The decline in the ETH/BTC ratio since [[ethereums_consensus_layer_and_validator_changes | Proof of Stake]] is attributed not to the technical merits of [[ethereums_consensus_layer_and_validator_changes | Proof of Stake]] or [[eip1559_and_its_impact_on_ethereum_valuation | EIP-1559]] themselves, but to the shift in social consensus and attentional focus from a commodity [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] to a DCF model [00:32:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

> "The superpower with proof of work... is you can't coherently talk about discounted cash flows in proof of work. So you there's no this pitfall doesn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>

## The Dilemma of Dual Identity

[[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum]] inherently has revenues from its Layer 1, making it challenging to entirely ignore the DCF aspect [00:34:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The challenge lies in balancing the desire for [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] to be a commodity-like asset with its reality as a revenue-bearing technology platform [00:34:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

*   **Technology vs. Asset:** It is crucial to separate [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum]] the technology from [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] the asset [00:09:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While the technology can be amazing and contribute to a better world, this does not automatically guarantee the price of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] will increase [01:11:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **The "Floor Price" Misdirection:** Focusing predominantly on [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]]'s revenues and discounted cash flows (e.g., from [[eip1559_and_its_impact_on_ethereum_valuation | EIP-1559]] burns or Layer 2 settlement) means focusing on its "floor price" [01:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This can lead to a scenario where even with massive technological adoption and usage (e.g., half a trillion dollars in RWAs on [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum]]), the value of [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] might only increase marginally if the market values it primarily at this transactional floor [01:08:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

## [[cultivating_a_strong_ethereum_community_narrative | Cultivating a Strong Ethereum Community Narrative]]

Some in the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] advocate for a more unified and even [[maximalism_and_nationalism_in_the_ethereum_community | maximalist]] approach to defining [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] as a commodity and [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]], similar to how [[differences_between_ethereum_and_bitcoin_communities | Bitcoin communities]] operate [00:44:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

*   **The "Blue Money Gospel":** Ryan Sean Adams' "Blue Money Gospel" proposes a "cult-like" behavior around [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]], emphasizing holding, staking, and celebrating purchases, while "shaming" anything that detracts from [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] as the primary asset [00:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This is seen as a way to "shift the Overton window" around [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] to a more fervent, [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]]-focused narrative [00:45:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   **The Need for Clarity:** Without a clear, unified definition, the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] appears "schizophrenic," with various parties promoting different, sometimes conflicting, narratives about [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] [01:14:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. This lack of a clear shelling point leads to unproductive internal debates and prevents a coherent message to external stakeholders [01:17:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Emission Algorithm:** For [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] to be perceived as a commodity money, a social commitment to never change its emission algorithm (even if dynamic) is necessary, akin to Bitcoin's fixed supply cap [01:12:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The current dynamic emission makes it difficult for average individuals to reason about its supply, unlike Bitcoin's predictable halvings [01:13:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

## Separating Technology from Asset Value

The key takeaway is that the phenomenal technological advancements and roadmap of [[ethereums_strategic_pivot_and_community_reactions | Ethereum]] do not automatically translate to a higher [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] asset price if the social definition of the asset itself is unclear or misaligned [01:11:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

The potential for [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] to become a dominant commodity [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] and meme culture is high [01:53:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>, but this requires a conscious and coordinated effort to define it as such, rather than allowing its valuation to be anchored by DCF models that only reflect its "floor" utility [01:19:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. If [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | ETH]] is valued primarily as a DCF asset, its future price, even at significantly higher absolute values, could still represent a relative decline against Bitcoin, which benefits from its clearer [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | store of value]] narrative [01:04:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. The argument concludes that the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] has the capacity to purposively shift this social consensus, as it has inadvertently shifted it in the past [01:20:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

The first week of May saw significant discussions surrounding a strategic shift within the [[Ethereums strategic pivot and ongoing developments | Ethereum ecosystem]], characterized by leadership changes at the [[Ethereum Foundation leadership changes | Ethereum Foundation]] and a reprioritization of its roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. This has been widely perceived as a move towards a more product-centric approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>.

## New Leadership at the Ethereum Foundation

The [[Ethereum Foundation leadership changes | Ethereum Foundation]] (EF) has announced a restructured leadership, with Shiae and Tamas now serving as co-executive directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>. The EF's board of directors now comprises Falcbuterin, Ayamayaguchi, Patrick Stoneger (Swiss legal counsel), and Shiae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This board oversees the EF's vision, ensures alignment with its values, and holds authority over executive appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. There is considerable optimism regarding Tamas's ability to introduce operational excellence to the Ethereum organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>.

## Strategic Priorities: Scaling Layer 1, Blobs, and UX

In a co-statement, Shiae and Tamas outlined their near-term goals, with Tamas specifically identifying three key areas for the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>:
1.  **Scaling the Layer 1 (L1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
2.  **Scaling blobs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
3.  **Improving User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>

These three objectives have become a rallying cry for the Ethereum community, signaling a shift towards a product-centric roadmap, as opposed to solely a rollup-centric one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## The "Pivot" vs. "Reprioritization" Debate

A significant debate has emerged within the community regarding whether these changes constitute a "pivot" or merely a "reprioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a>.

### Arguments for a "Pivot"
The argument for a "pivot" largely stems from the emphasis on scaling the L1, which was not a clear priority on the roadmap three, six, or even a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>. It was even considered "culturally blasphemous to talk about scaling the layer one at times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The departure of figures like Max Resnik to Solana, partly due to Ethereum's perceived lack of L1 scaling, reinforces this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Tamas's appointment from an external perspective also suggests a leadership pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.

Dankrad's Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to scale Ethereum L1 by 100x over the next four years further exemplifies this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. He asserted that "The current way of doing things is likely to make Ethereum irrelevant over the next 5 to 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Dankrad proposes a commitment to "3x the scaling on Ethereum transaction throughput on Ethereum every year for the next four years and basically guarantee that to the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He argues that the L1 will always be the fee revenue driver and moat for Decentralized Applications (DApps), and fragmenting L1 liquidity across multiple Layer 2s (L2s) could lead to losing the battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

> "Committing to a scaling timeline makes it clear what the goal is and lets us plan backwards from that goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Arguments for "Reprioritization"
Anthony Sassano argues that it's not a pivot, as scaling the L1 was always part of the broader roadmap, encompassing phases like "Merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. He suggests it's simply a matter of bringing existing priorities to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### The Significance of the Debate
Hazu's commentary suggests that the reluctance to call it a "pivot" might be an "ego thing" within the community, avoiding admitting past missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He believes it is "damaging" not to admit when things were wrong, as the market and broader crypto industry are increasingly less aligned with rigid Ethereum messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Acknowledging a pivot demonstrates humility and a commitment to correction, which the market wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Vitalik's Continued Focus

Vitalik Buterin's personal focuses for 2025 align with these strategic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>:
1.  **Ethereum:** Emphasizing the Layer 1 long-term roadmap, including single-slot finality, long-term VM statelessness, security, resilience, and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Full-stack security, open source, and privacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Big picture DACK (defensive acceleration):** Focusing on tools outside of crypto like Signal, infrastructure, and social layer mechanism design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

Vitalik continues to lead Ethereum through philosophical blog posts, outlining the direction for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Layer 2 Decentralization Milestones

In a positive development, two major Layer 2 solutions, Base and Scroll, have achieved "Stage 1" decentralization on L2BEAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This is a significant milestone, as many believed these chains would never be incentivized to reach this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

[!NOTE|Stage 1 Definition]
Stage 1 is a measure of property rights for users on Layer 2s. A Stage 0 rollup implies a "trustful" and potentially "ruggable" environment where operators have significant control over user assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. In contrast, a Stage 1 rollup introduces "degrees of protections for users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Base, for example, achieved this by establishing a fully functional security council of 10 independent entities across multiple jurisdictions, requiring 75% consensus for upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This substantially reduces Coinbase's unilateral control over Base, strengthening user protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

The top four chains by total value secured are now all at Stage 1 decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

The consensus within the Ethereum community appears largely positive regarding these [[Ethereums strategic pivot and community reactions | changes]], whether deemed a reprioritization or a pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The focus on product-centric development, particularly with leadership like Tamas bringing a "founder, CEO, product mindset" to the Ethereum Foundation, is seen as a strong step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. The community hopes to see consistent upgrades and forks every six months, as promised by Tamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. The challenge remains in turning these plans into action and overcoming older cultural ideologies within Ethereum that may resist a more aggressive product focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The rapid evolution of content generation, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), has brought the existing copyright system to a crossroads, highlighting its inadequacy in supporting the current digital reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Outdated Copyright System

The current copyright system, which dates back to the printing press, was well-suited for traditional media like books, radio, and television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These channels were characterized by a top-down distribution model, where content distribution was tightly controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This control allowed for effective enforcement of royalties, such as for songs used on radio stations or films transmitted via TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Internet's Impact on Content Distribution

Even before the widespread adoption of AI, the internet fundamentally transformed content distribution. With the internet, everything became peer-to-peer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This shift led to the rise of numerous content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and content began to be remixed and shared almost instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This change in distribution model already challenged the traditional copyright framework, highlighting the [[impact_of_the_internet_on_copyright_distribution | impact of the internet on copyright distribution]].

## AI's Exponential Growth in Content Generation

The challenges posed by the internet have been exponentially amplified by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. AI's capabilities mean that petabytes and exabytes of content are now being generated daily, possibly even every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This immense volume of new content further strains the existing, outdated copyright system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, as it struggles to keep pace with the sheer scale and speed of content creation.

## The Need for a New Intellectual Property System

Given the current reality, there is a pressing need for a new [[future_of_intellectual_property_in_the_age_of_ai | intellectual property (IP) system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This system must be compatible with the speed of the internet and possess programmability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Key features of such a system would include:

*   **Instant Registration:** Any newly created IP should be instantly registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Seamless Licensing and Attribution:** If new content is created based on existing material, it should be seamlessly licensed and attributed fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This proposed system aims to address the [[challenges_in_registering_and_attributing_new_content | challenges in registering and attributing new content]] in an era of rapid AI-driven content generation.

The integration of native rollups into the [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] ecosystem is poised to significantly impact the network's economics, primarily by enhancing value creation, security, and the demand for [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This shift aims to consolidate fragmented Layer 2 (L2) landscapes and align their growth more closely with the Layer 1 (L1) protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## The Problem: Heterogeneity and Fragmented Value Accrual

[[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum's]] initial scaling strategy involved exporting development to independent L2 teams, resulting in a diverse but fragmented rollup landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach, while incentivizing innovation and attracting venture capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, led to several issues:
*   **Non-Homogeneous Rollups** Each L2 rolled its own code, leading to different security assumptions and competing standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This has created a perception that L2s are distinct from [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Interoperability Challenges** Current optimistic rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, suffer from 7-day withdrawal windows due to their fraud proof systems, making it difficult for users to move assets between chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Centralized Sequencers** Many rollups use centralized sequencers, posing a centralization risk and contributing to interoperability problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Security and Governance Risks** Each rollup currently maintains its own state transition function and proof system, often governed by multi-sig security councils. This introduces potential single points of failure and security concerns, as seen with hacks targeting similar multi-sig infrastructures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **Limited Value Accrual to L1** The current flexible rollup model allows L2s to capture a significant portion of the value they create, such as sequencer fees, with less direct fee value flowing back to the [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **User Distrust** Only about 2% of all [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] is currently bridged to L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. This low percentage suggests users may lack confidence in the long-term property right assurances offered by current L2s, preferring the L1's established security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## Native Rollups: A Solution for Enhanced Value Creation

Native rollups are a design construction aimed at tackling the issue of non-homogeneous rollups by embedding [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum's]] security directly into the L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **EVM Pre-compile:** The core mechanism is an EVM pre-compile, a complex instruction that allows the L1 to verify the validity of its native rollups. This means L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base could discard their own fraud proof code and security councils, relying on the L1 for [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum-level security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Reduced Bugs and Forward Compatibility:** By providing introspection into the L1, the pre-compile allows L2s to leverage the L1's client diversity, mitigating bugs that arise from emulating the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. It also ensures forward compatibility with EVM upgrades, moving towards "trustless rollups" without reliance on security councils or governance tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **"Programmable Shards":** Native rollups can be viewed as "programmable shards" of [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]], unifying more closely with the L1 through both sequencing (with base rollups) and execution (with native execution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Economic Impacts and Value Accrual for [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]]

The adoption of native rollups offers several significant economic benefits for [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]]:
*   **Increased Network Effects and Composability:** By using a shared EVM standard, native rollups enhance the network effects of [[Security and interoperability of Ethereum rollups | Ethereum]], fostering greater composability and shared security. This allows for the creation of "money Legos" that are more reliable and desirable for composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Demand for [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] and Data Availability:** While the native execution pre-compile itself may be offered for free (meaning no direct execution fees for L1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, the primary value accrual to [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] comes from increased demand for [[Ethereums scaling strategy with native rollups | Ethereum's data availability]] (blobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Native rollups create a stronger "lock-in" to [[Ethereums scaling strategy with native rollups | Ethereum's Data Availability (DA)]], as using the execute pre-compile necessitates the use of [[Ethereums scaling strategy with native rollups | Ethereum DA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This increased demand is expected to significantly help [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] value accrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, potentially increasing demand for [[EIP1559 and its impact on Ethereum valuation | ETH]] through fee burning and its use as a pristine collateral asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security and User Confidence:** Native rollups aim to provide users with the same strong property right assurances as the [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. This dramatically improved security is expected to increase Total Value Locked (TVL) on rollups, potentially bringing the percentage of bridged assets closer to 90-100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. The simple adage is: "become native, get more TVL, get more users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.
*   **Scaling through ZK-proofs:** While a vanilla EVM pre-compile wouldn't significantly scale [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] due to gas limits, the integration of [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK-proofs]] allows for dramatically increasing the gas limit of the execute pre-compile (10x, even 1000x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. This enables true scaling of the L1 in a meaningful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Quantum Security:** Native rollups offer a path to quantum security. Since no proofs are submitted directly on-chain, they automatically inherit the L1's post-quantum security upgrades, removing this concern for L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   **Proof Aggregation:** Native rollups enable the L1 validators to aggregate proofs across all native rollups behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. This optimization could drastically reduce the gas costs for L2s to settle, as [[Ethereums Layer 2 Rollup Strategy | Ethereum]] would only need to verify a single proof for all aggregated rollups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

## Transition and Challenges

Migrating to native rollups presents [[Technical challenges and execution for native rollups | technical challenges and execution]]. Existing rollups must refactor their code to cleanly decouple the user state transition function from system-level code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. While not possible for non-EVM virtual machines like SVM or Move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>, EVM-equivalent rollups are strongly incentivized to become native due to the significant security and property right benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.

The timeline for implementation involves a hard fork, requiring an [[Coordination and governance in Ethereums rollup roadmap | EIP]], All Core Devs consensus, Dev Nets, and Test Nets. This is at least a 12 to 18-month process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. A major bottleneck is the lack of a dedicated coordinator or champion to lead this work full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. However, there is optimism for an initial re-execution-backed pre-compile by late 2026, with full [[Ethereums ZK scaling developments | ZK-proof]] integration to dramatically increase gas limits potentially three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.

The question for crypto market participants is whether an "alt season meltup" is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Mike Ippolito, founder of the DeFi Report, and Ryan Sean Adams discuss that a lot of people are "ready for alt season" due to animal spirits and Bitcoin dominance potentially peaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Defining Alt Season

Alt season is defined as a period where over 50% of new capital entering the crypto market flows into assets other than Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Historically, Bitcoin leads the market, and altcoins tend to follow, with a key inflection point typically occurring in the last year of a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## Crypto Cycles and Human Behavior

Crypto cycles, where Bitcoin dominance increases and then decreases relative to other assets, tend to repeat because of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. When Bitcoin has seen significant gains, investors often rotate their profits into riskier assets further out the risk curve, seeking larger potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This shift in capital allocation creates the "wealth effect" that fuels alt season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:16:00">[48:16:00]</a>.

The previous alt season occurred very early in 2021, kicked off by a massive Ether (ETH) price jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>, which was notably preceded by an OC ruling related to stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. This cycle followed a strong Bitcoin run in late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.

## Macro Catalysts for Current Alt Season Outlook

Several macro catalysts indicate a bullish environment for crypto:
*   **Shift from Austerity**: Initial concerns about austerity policies from the Trump administration have diminished, with continued fiscal spending appearing more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. This fiscal spend, characterized by deficits, acts as a surplus to the economy, driving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: The understanding that government finance, especially the Treasury, drives the market through fiscal spending (rather than the Fed, which is currently "sitting on their hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>) supports continued liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Bill Legislation**: The expected passage of a stablecoin bill is considered "huge" and currently "discounted in the markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. This bill could allow for more debt issuance into stablecoins, which is bullish for the US and the US dollar, and historically, regulatory clarity around stablecoins has preceded significant market moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.

While a "nice little pocket" of alt season is expected, some concerns exist for the July-August period, including the end of tariff pauses and incoming economic data that might reveal real economy slowdowns, potentially causing a correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.

## Key Market Indicators and Onchain Data

Mike Ippolito and Ryan Sean Adams emphasize a data-driven approach to understanding crypto fundamentals, distinct from short-term technical analysis, focusing on long-term trends and momentum indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Bitcoin and Ether Moving Averages
*   **Golden Cross**: Bitcoin recently achieved a "golden cross" where the 50-day moving average pierced above the 200-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>. This signals an aggressive upside move and can sometimes precede a short-term correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.
*   **ETH Potential**: Ether's 50-day moving average is making a run towards its 200-day, suggesting a potential golden cross around $3,000 if it catches up to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. This is seen as a "matter of time" for ETH to gain ground on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:39:00">[49:39:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply
This metric indicates where the market is in its cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>. At market peaks, LTHs (who buy dips and hold for extended periods) start selling their coins to new, short-term holders (STHs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

*   The ratio of LTHs to STHs correlates with market tops; a bottom in this ratio indicates LTHs have exited and STHs are dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[39:22:00]</a>.
*   Currently, LTHs are starting to take some profit, but the market is just at the "very beginning" of this trend, suggesting more room for upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>.

### MVRV Z-Score
This Glassnode metric measures the market value to realized value (cost basis of all bitcoins on the network) and indicates if the market is overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>.
*   A higher z-score suggests a more "euphoric" or "bubbly" market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:35:00">[45:35:00]</a>.
*   While previous cycles saw z-scores as high as 7-12, the current score is 2.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>, implying significant room for growth before the market becomes overheated, potentially reaching a z-score of five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:38:00">[47:38:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategy: Longer-Term Horizons and Asset Selection

Mike Ippolito advocates for a long-term, buy-and-hold investment philosophy, similar to Warren Buffett's approach, rather than short-term trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This involves deeply understanding assets, building strong conviction based on data, and holding for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. He aims to understand where the market is in its cycle and combine that with [[analyzing_crypto_assets_through_onchain_data_and_indicators | fundamental analysis]] of specific assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

### Asset Selection in Alt Season
Asset selection is critical, as not "everything is going to rise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>. The market is becoming more sophisticated, demanding strong fundamental stories from assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:54:00">[50:54:00]</a>.

*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Expected to be a primary beneficiary of alt season, despite recent negative sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>.
*   **High-Beta "Culture Coins"**: Mike Ippolito allocates a small percentage of profits to high-beta [[market_trends_in_crypto_and_ethereum | memecoins]] as a "risk-on bet" for the end of the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>. These are seen as beta plays on their respective L1 ecosystems:
    *   Pepe (PEPE) for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:08:00">[55:08:00]</a>
    *   Bonk (BONK) for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a>
*   **Celestia (TIA)**: A bet on the Data Availability (DA) space, purchased when "so depressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34:00">[57:34:00]</a>.
*   **Worldcoin (WLD)**: Considered an [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | interesting]] speculative bet due to its potential [[ai_and_cryptocurrency_market_trends | AI]] perspective, association with Sam Altman, and its Worldcoin L2 being number two in blobs paid to L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>. It's a low-float token, which can lead to aggressive price movements with less capital but carries risks of inflation and unlocks during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Allocation (as of recording)
Mike Ippolito maintains a higher cash position than most (around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a>), having sold during a perceived "pico top" phase and then bought back into corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>. His crypto portfolio is approximately:
*   60% Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>
*   19% ETH ecosystem (including ETH and Pepe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:58:00">[54:58:00]</a>
*   Other positions in Solana beta assets (Bonk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:24:00">[57:24:00]</a>, Celestia, and Worldcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:32:00">[57:32:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Exit Strategy

The current probability points towards an alt season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>, implying it is "time to rotate" some capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:58:00">[52:58:00]</a>. While long-term Bitcoin positions may never be sold, for riskier assets, the strategy involves scaling out during the bull run to accumulate a stronger cash position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. This cash can then be deployed to buy fundamental assets during the next bear market, playing a "long-term game accumulation game" around crypto networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. This approach requires deep understanding of the infrastructure and value generation of assets like Solana's MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) infrastructure and its impact on SOL holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

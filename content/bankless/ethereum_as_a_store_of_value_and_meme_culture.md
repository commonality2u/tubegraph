Cultivating [[ethereums_identity_as_a_store_of_value | Ethereum's identity as a store of value]] requires active participation from its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes encouraging others to hold ETH and celebrating those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Actions like staking, restaking, and auto-staking are also encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Role of Memes and Narrative

A key strategy for establishing ETH as a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] is to [[the_role_and_future_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_industry | meme]] it as "digital gold with yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This involves various forms of content creation such as writing, tweeting, podcasting, and "shitposting," as well as electing leaders who promote the same message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The goal is to make the idea of "1 ETH equals 1 ETH" as fundamental as kindergarten math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The foundation of a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]], whether it's gold or Bitcoin, is often "irrational confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Ethereum is perceived as being "too kind of smart and so ivory tower" to fully embrace the [[the_cultural_and_economic_implications_of_meme_coins | meme layer narrative]] necessary to create a [[store_of_value_uses_for_cryptocurrencies | store of value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Strategy

While some may hesitate at the idea of "shaming" those who do not hold ETH (such as L2s, treasuries, whales, and DAOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, this assertive approach is presented as necessary for the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] to "win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Not every member of the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] needs to adopt this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A contingent of "ETH bulls" who are highly enthusiastic about ETH, potentially veering towards "laser eyes" (a reference to Bitcoin maximalist imagery) but not necessarily Bitcoin-level toxicity, is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

There is a call to reorient the discussion within the [[ethereum_community_culture | Ethereum community]] towards ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, emphasizing the need for faith in the asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

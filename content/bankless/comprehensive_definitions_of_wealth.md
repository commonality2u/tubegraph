Defining wealth comprehensively involves more than just financial metrics; it also encompasses personal values and various aspects of well-being.

## Defining "Enough" Financial Wealth

For many years, the concept of "crypto wealth" was discussed without a clear definition of what "enough" truly meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[Defining financial enough | Defining 'enough']] refers to reaching a financial state where one no longer needs to "look at the scoreboard" for personal and family needs, and to provide for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This perspective isn't driven by greed, but by the enjoyment of the "game" of growing a business and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Previously, financial goals were often viewed like an "arcade game" focused on achieving a "high score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, the critical step of defining what "enough" meant, particularly with a spouse, was often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Expanding the Definition of Wealth

The initial understanding of wealth was often too narrow, primarily focusing on net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While net worth is a key component, it's also a definition often imposed by society as a measure of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

A more comprehensive view recognizes that financial wealth is just one type among several <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other crucial forms of wealth include:
*   Time wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Relationship or social wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Mental wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Physical wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Realizing this broader definition often reveals an "overallocation" to the financial side, with insufficient attention paid to these other four types of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

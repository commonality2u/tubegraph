Since World War II, the global monetary system has undergone significant structural changes, driven by economic shifts, political decisions, and evolving power dynamics. These transformations have had profound implications for global trade, finance, and the everyday lives of citizens.

## Bretton Woods (1944-1971)

The first major post-World War II monetary structure was established at Bretton Woods in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:33">[03:54:33]</a>. This system involved the US dollar being pegged to gold, while other allied currencies were pegged to the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:26">[05:54:26]</a>. The US government guaranteed that central banks could exchange dollars for gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:51">[06:03:51]</a>.

The primary aim of Bretton Woods was to economically divide the world and rebuild allies, especially with the purpose of containing Soviet Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The United States financed the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, allowing them to prosper through exports after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. John Maynard Keynes had proposed a customs union with mechanisms to rectify economic imbalances and "user fees" on financial markets of surplus countries to balance trade, but this plan was not adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

The Bretton Woods system worked well for the US until the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Large US deficits, due to programs like LBJ's Great Society and the Vietnam War, led foreign nations, particularly France, to demand their gold back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. In 1971, President Nixon announced the end of the dollar's link to gold, allowing the currency to freely float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This marked the end of Bretton Woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Petrodollar Era (1971-1994)

Following the end of the gold standard, the petrodollar system emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. This involved a strong, albeit casual, link between the dollar and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. The US made a deal with Saudi Arabia: if they sold their oil in dollars, the US would sell them weapons and ensure the Saudi royal family's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. The dollars earned by Saudi Arabia were then deposited in US banks and used to buy US Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Since Saudi Arabia was the lowest marginal cost producer of oil, and oil was essential for the global economy, this arrangement compelled other nations to acquire dollars to purchase oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. The US military implicitly backed this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. This system established US Treasuries as the global reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Petro-Yuan Era (1994- ~2008/2021)

While many believed the petrodollar era persisted, a new phase, termed the "Petro-Yuan," began around 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Historically, China and India were the largest economies for thousands of years, a trend that began to re-emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

By the 1980s, oil became less central to the global economy due to efficiency gains and new discoveries in Mexico and Alaska, reducing OPEC's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. China, aiming to become a manufacturing powerhouse like Japan, devalued its yuan in 1994 to make its productive capacity extremely competitive for exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Other "Asian Tigers" followed a similar mercantilist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

In this era, Asian exporting countries would undervalue their currencies and accumulate US Treasuries to ensure access to dollar-denominated commodity imports, particularly oil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. This system allowed Americans and Europeans to de-industrialize, financialize their economies, keep inflation low, and boost corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:21]</a>.

However, this had a significant impact on the US economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. To maintain its global reserve currency status, the US needed to run an open capital account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>, meaning it had to export dollars that foreigners would then invest in US assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. This led to corporations moving manufacturing to Asia for cheaper labor, increasing corporate profits, and leading to debt-financed stock buybacks rather than new factory construction in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. While stock owners became wealthy, the bottom 90% of Americans, especially those without university degrees, saw their high-paying jobs disappear, replaced by the gig economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. This social discontent contributed to the election of figures like Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.

This system, described by Russell Napier as an era of financial repression and national capitalism, proved unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

## The Emerging New Monetary Structure (Post-2008/2021)

We are currently in the midst of a transfer to a [[implications_of_a_new_monetary_order | new monetary structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. A key characteristic is the diminishing role of US Treasuries as the sole global reserve asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. This is partly a direct policy choice by figures like Trump and his advisors, who believe the post-1971 system led to social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.

### Policy Responses and Challenges

*   **Tariffs**: The Trump administration initially pursued tariffs to rectify trade imbalances and re-industrialize America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. However, tariffs proved politically destabilizing because they directly taxed consumption, leading to goods inflation without immediately creating higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. This negative public feedback led to a pause in escalating tariffs, suggesting they are not a politically sustainable tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:29:00">[26:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.
*   **[[currency_demand_fluctuations_and_economic_protectionism | Capital Controls]]**: The likely next step to address trade imbalances will be [[currency_demand_fluctuations_and_economic_protectionism | capital controls]], which attack the capital account surplus and foreign ownership of US financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   "User fees" (taxes) on foreign ownership of US stocks, bonds, and real estate, potentially around 2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>. This could generate hundreds of billions in revenue, allowing for the elimination of income taxes for 90% of Americans, making it a politically popular move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>.
    *   More direct bans, such as states like Texas banning certain foreign nationals from owning land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>. While common in other countries, this is a significant shift for the US as a global reserve currency issuer, which traditionally requires an open capital account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.
    *   Potentially, forcing domestic entities like pension funds to buy government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:22]</a>.

### Consequences and the Role of [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | Money Printing]]

The introduction of [[currency_demand_fluctuations_and_economic_protectionism | capital controls]] will likely lead to foreign divestment from US markets, causing a decline in US stock and bond prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. In response, the Treasury, the Fed, and politicians will likely resort to [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]] to provide the necessary dollars and replace exiting foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>. This is because no politician would campaign on austerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:53:00">[58:53:00]</a>.

The Fed is already engaging in quantitative easing (QE) within its quantitative tightening (QT) regime by selectively buying 10-year bonds to keep yields down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>. Major bankers predict a full restart of QE in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>. The Fed's primary goal is to fund the US government and preserve the empire, not necessarily to preserve the dollar's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02:00">[56:02:00]</a>. When bond market volatility (measured by the MOVE index) spikes, an immediate policy response of increased liquidity or [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]] is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.

### Investment Implications

In this environment of inevitable [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]] and [[potential_changes_in_global_liquidity_and_their_implications | potential changes in global liquidity]], assets like gold and Bitcoin are expected to perform strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:23:00">[41:23:00]</a>. They offer a neutral store of value that is not reliant on any single national monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>. Bonds, especially long-term government bonds, are seen as undesirable assets due to the prospect of [[impact_of_fiscal_dominance_on_monetary_policy | fiscal dominance]] and financial repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>. Short-term Treasury bills are considered a cash substitute, offering higher yields than bank deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

The **[[global_liquidity_trends_and_m2_cycle | global liquidity]]** cycle is considered the most crucial factor for crypto asset performance, as it indicates the amount of fiat currency chasing new stores of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. Indicators like excess reserves at the Fed plus other banking system deposits are key proxies for bank lending and liquidity creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. While the US is expected to print money to protect its system, China is more hesitant due to past misallocation of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

The shift towards [[currency_demand_fluctuations_and_economic_protectionism | capital controls]] and increased **[[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]]** makes [[crypto_as_a_hedge_against_monetary_policy_shifts | crypto as a hedge]] against monetary policy shifts particularly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:00">[41:14:00]</a>. While a hot war scenario (e.g., China invading Taiwan) is considered unlikely, such an event would only accelerate these trends, making non-custodial assets even more vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.

A potential "3D chess move" by the US could involve revaluing its gold reserves from $42 per ounce to market price, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for government spending and political initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. This, combined with the push for re-industrialization, would further necessitate [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]] and bolster the case for hard assets.

Overall, the current phase is characterized by a gradual "divorce" between major economic powers, leading to increased [[currency_demand_fluctuations_and_economic_protectionism | capital controls]], [[us_governments_fiscal_and_monetary_policy_challenges | fiscal and monetary policy challenges]], and a significant shift in global investment strategies towards assets that can withstand unprecedented levels of [[potential_recession_and_money_printing | money printing]].

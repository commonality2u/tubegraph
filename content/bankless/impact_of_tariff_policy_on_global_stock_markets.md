The implementation and ongoing changes in tariff policy under the Trump administration have introduced significant volatility and uncertainty into global stock markets, influencing investor confidence, trade relations, and the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Initial Tariff Announcements and Market Reaction

On "Liberation Day," tariffs were announced last week, including a 10% baseline tariff globally and much higher reciprocal trade tariffs in the 30% to 80% range for 86 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These "staggering tariff levels" immediately sent the stock market plummeting, as the market perceived that [[us_foreign_trade_policies_and_tariffs_under_trump_administration | Trump]] was serious about their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The S&P 500 declined 16% from peak to trough, setting a record for one of the quickest stock market declines in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Escalation of Trade Tensions

Following the initial announcements, 70 countries reportedly rushed to the negotiation table with the United States to reset their trade arrangements, but China remained an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | Trump imposed a 34% reciprocal tariff on China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. In response, China announced its own 30% tariff on all United States imports, kicking off a [[trade_tensions_and_tariffs_involving_the_us | trade war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Trump later threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods unless China withdrew its retaliatory measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. When China did not back down, proceeding with its planned 34% tariff increase (which stacked on previous tariffs for a total of 84%), Trump immediately increased tariffs on China to 125% (totaling 145% stacked with previous tariffs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Policy Inconsistency and Market Volatility

Simultaneously with the increased tariffs on China, Trump announced a 90-day pause on all tariff hikes for the rest of the world, reverting to the general 10% import tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This announcement, made on Truth Social, brought significant relief to the market, which immediately began to rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The market saw its biggest one-day increase (up 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, gains were subsequently given back, leaving the market down about 8-9% from before Liberation Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

The policy inconsistency, where the US government "backed off their word within a week," led businesses to distrust the administration's pronouncements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Companies paused investments due to uncertainty, causing measures of investment in the US to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The lack of clear, consistent communication from the administration, with officials contradicting each other and Trump himself, sent markets into a "tail spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This environment highlighted the "cost of instability" and being an "unreliable partner," which damages trust and predictability—key strengths of the US as a financial center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Critique of Trump's Tariff Strategy

Critics argue that Trump's approach was less a "3D chess" master plan and more akin to "1D checkers," characterized by inconsistent moves that did not make sense individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Miscalculation of Reciprocal Tariffs
Trump repeatedly described tariffs as "reciprocal," which the market assumed meant matching tariff rates. However, the reciprocal tariffs were not based on trade barriers or existing tariff rates, but rather on the trade deficit—the imbalance of trade where countries bought fewer US goods than the US bought from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This logic was flawed because a trade deficit doesn't necessarily indicate a country is "doing anything bad," nor does it account for a country's economic capacity to purchase US goods (e.g., Vietnam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Even countries with a trade surplus for the US, like Australia, were hit with tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Political and Economic Backlash
A "revolt within the financial class" and among Republicans in Congress emerged, criticizing the tariffs as "nonsensical policy" that would harm Republicans in midterms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Public polling showed overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards Trump's tariffs, even among Republicans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. High-profile supporters like Bill Ackman publicly advised Trump to walk back the tariffs and take a 90-day pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This advice was eventually adopted, with Secretary Besson reportedly convincing Trump at Mar-a-Lago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Unclear Goals and Unpredictability
The administration's goals for trade policy remained unclear, vacillating between aiming for zero tariffs and free trade agreements, and raising revenue while punishing countries perceived as unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This ambiguity created further uncertainty for businesses, which require predictability for long-term investments like building factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Such investments are too significant to base on policies that could be reversed by the current or a future administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Broader Market and Economic Impacts

The tariff policy had a "miserable triple whammy" on markets: stocks down, 10-year bond yields up (indicating less demand for treasuries), and the dollar down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This suggests that the US, as the world's capital center, was losing strength, with capital flowing out as foreign investors sold bonds and pulled money from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The market currently shows "scarring" and "wounds" in the US economy and trust in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

Tariffs are inherently inflationary, and the imposition of massive tariffs on China, a major trading partner from whom it is difficult to substitute imports, is expected to increase inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. Consumer inflation expectations have already risen significantly in response to trade policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. The 145% tariff on China effectively acts as a trade embargo, making trade uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

The chaos and unpredictability raise the probability of a recession, with PolyMarket pricing in a 50% probability, down from 66% before the tariffs were walked back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. This instability discourages companies from investment and hiring, leading to economic contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_tariffs_on_bitcoin_and_risk_assets | Impact of Tariffs on Bitcoin and Risk Assets]]

Crypto markets, particularly altcoins, behave like [[the_impact_of_tariffs_on_bitcoin_and_risk_assets | risk assets]] or tech stocks, and have been "decimated alongside the NASDAQ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. While crypto is tied to risk appetite, it is not tied to corporate earnings, which may go down in the real economy due to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Crypto's globalized demand base also offers some insulation from US consumer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. If central banks cut rates or inject emergency liquidity due to a financial crisis, crypto could rebound dramatically from "monetary stimulus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This suggests that "if something breaks, it's going to end up being very bullish for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

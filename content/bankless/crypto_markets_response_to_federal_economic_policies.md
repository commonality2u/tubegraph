The second week of February saw significant developments in the macro economy, particularly concerning Federal Reserve policy, which elicited notable reactions across traditional and crypto markets alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Federal Reserve's Stance on Interest Rates

Hopes for more Federal Reserve rate cuts were "dashed" as Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that current economic conditions were not yet conducive for such moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Powell emphasized that the Fed is "in no rush" to cut interest rates, citing a strong economy and elevated inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Inflation had risen by 0.5% month-over-month, reaching 3% year-over-year, slightly above the forecasted 2.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Reaction and Policy Stance

Former President Donald Trump publicly disagreed with the Federal Reserve's position, tweeting on Truth Social that "interest rates should be lowered" and that this should align with "upcoming tariffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This stance echoes his previous efforts during his administration eight years prior, where he also pressed Powell to adopt a more "easy monetary policy environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Trump's Economic Policy
> Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, are generally seen as pro-inflationary because they make imported goods more expensive, even if cheaper to produce abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. His approach relies on low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Market Reactions to Fed Signals and Trump's Comments

The broader markets reacted negatively to the Federal Reserve's signals. The S&P 500 saw a decline of a quarter of a percent, and treasury yields jumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This rise in treasury yields is contrary to what Trump advocates, as he desires them to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Crucially for the crypto space, **Bitcoin** and the broader crypto markets also dipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Bitcoin specifically fell below $95,000 when markets opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

> [!INFO] Crypto as a Prediction Market
> The crypto market sometimes acts as a "prediction market on the weekends for what the Nasdaq is going to do on Monday," especially during flat periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

For the week, Bitcoin was relatively flat, down 1.8%, while Ether was down 2.7%, continuing its slide against Bitcoin, trading around $2,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Altcoin Market Performance

The current market cycle has seen [[crypto_market_downturn_analysis | new chain launches]] perform poorly, with meme coins significantly impacting the token values of new L1s and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While Ether has seen some positive news like [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | ETF inflows]] and attempts to launch [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | staking ETFs]], the "blood bath" is more pronounced in the "50 to 100 alts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Bitcoin dominance reportedly hit 70% during the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

This phenomenon is compared to the market behavior of 2018-2019, where there was significant pain before valuations reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that the market's patience for projects that raised at high private valuations has decreased due to the success of "fair launches" like Hyperliquid, which demonstrated strong product-market fit before token launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

### Positive Headwinds for Crypto

Despite the immediate market dips, there are perceived positive catalysts for cryptocurrencies. For Ether, the potential approval of an [[federal_reserve_policies_and_their_effect_on_crypto | Eth staking ETF]] is considered a "big deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This would allow ETF providers to potentially charge lower fees due to the natural yield from staking, mirroring the success of low-fee index funds in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Solana is also experiencing several "tailwinds," including potential ETF interest, overall usage growth, stablecoin issuance, and increasing institutional adoption, such as Franklin Templeton's announcement of a money market fund on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

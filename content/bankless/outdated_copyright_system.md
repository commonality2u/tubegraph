The existing copyright system is largely outdated and struggles to keep pace with the modern methods of [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content generation on the internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Context and Design

The current copyright system dates back to the printing press era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It was well-suited for books, radio, and television due to their top-down distribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In these traditional systems, distribution was controlled, making it feasible for producers and labels to enforce royalties for content usage, such as songs on radio stations or films transmitted via TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Challenges in the Internet and AI Era

With the advent of the internet, content creation and sharing shifted to a peer-to-peer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Content creators emerged, and [[Content generation and sharing on the internet | content is now remixed and shared at immense speeds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This exponential growth in content generation has been further amplified by the introduction of AI, leading to petabytes and exabytes of content being generated daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The current copyright system is unable to support this reality, creating a crossroads where a new approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Need for a Modern IP System

There is a [[need_for_a_new_IP_system | need for an IP system]] that is compatible with the speed of the internet and programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a system would enable instant registration of any created IP and facilitate seamless, fair licensing and attribution for new content derived from existing works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

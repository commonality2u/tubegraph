Even before the advent of [[Blockchain and Finance | blockchain]], systems like Wells Fargo online banking allowed users to access their bank accounts on [[Role of internet in modern finance | the internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this form of [[Internet Financial System | internet finance]] fundamentally differs from a truly internet-native financial system.

## The illusion of "internet finance"

The concept of pre-blockchain [[Internet Financial System | internet finance]] is often misunderstood. The act of performing a financial transaction in a legacy system via [[Role of internet in modern finance | the internet]] is comparable to ordering a pizza through GrubHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. [[Role of internet in modern finance | The internet]] in this context acts merely as a communication mechanism between the user and an "analog" service provider, such as a pizza shop, or in the case of finance, a traditional bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## How traditional finance operates

Traditional financial institutions, like Wells Fargo, operate on "permissioned silo databases" that are not directly on the open [[Role of internet in modern finance | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. When a user initiates a transaction, they send a message to the bank, which then performs the transaction within its internal, private database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The internet's role is solely for communication, notifying the user that the transaction has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Examples of siloed ownership

*   **Startup Investment**: When an individual invests in a startup, their ownership of the startup's equity is typically recorded in a spreadsheet maintained by the company's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Stock Ownership (e.g., Robinhood)**: If an individual owns shares of Apple on platforms like Robinhood, Robinhood maintains a server with a database entry indicating the user's ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This platform then interfaces with a depository trust company, which in turn works with Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This demonstrates the [[Limitations of current internet finance systems | limitations of current internet finance systems]]; traditional finance operates through siloed databases that communicate over [[Role of internet in modern finance | the internet]] only occasionally, rather than being built upon an open internet infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

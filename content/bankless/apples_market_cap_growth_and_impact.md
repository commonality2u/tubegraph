## Initial Market Cap and Perceived Limits

When [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]] released the iPhone in 2006, its market capitalization was approximately $70 billion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> At that time, [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | Exxon Mobile]] was the largest company globally, with a market cap of around $350 billion, not even reaching a trillion dollars. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

The perceived upper limit for [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]], which was seen as creating "toy consumer devices" that were not "that serious," was considered to be about five times its initial valuation, potentially reaching the level of the most valuable company in the world, which was [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | oil]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> This perception was based on the idea that [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | oil]] "ran the world" and represented the maximum possible market value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

## Current Market Cap and Industry Creation

However, [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]] defied these perceived limits, eventually reaching a $4 trillion market capitalization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> This significant growth occurred because [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]] "created an entirely new industry" on top of the existing economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> This new industry proved to be "worth a lot more than [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | oil]]". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Future Parallels

This phenomenon of creating a new, more valuable industry is seen as a parallel to what might happen with robotics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> Just as [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]] surpassed the perceived maximum set by [[comparison_of_apple_and_oil_companies | oil]], a robotics company is anticipated to exceed [[creation_of_new_industries_by_apple | Apple]]'s $4 trillion market cap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> This is because robotics could exponentially expand the workforce and significantly lower production costs, making it "a really big deal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

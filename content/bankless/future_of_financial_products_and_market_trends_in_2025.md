## Evolution of Financial Markets

Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock, oversees $6.6 trillion in BlackRock's iShares ETF funds and index products, a significant domain in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Cohen identifies herself as a career "[[Modernization_of_financial_markets_with_blockchain | markets modernizer]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, driven by a passion for making markets more resilient, transparent, and useful for more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Technology as a Foundation for Modernization

Technology innovation has been foundational to market modernization for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Historically, early forms of trade used clay tokens as technological breakthroughs to exchange real-world assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. More recently, index strategies, allowing investors to diversify portfolios with hundreds or thousands of items, became possible only 30-40 years ago with the advent of the first commercial microchip, which provided the necessary computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Bitcoin and Ether ETPs as Bridges

The introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US has created a bridge between the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This bridge proved useful for both TradFi investors seeking familiar wrappers for Bitcoin and digital-native investors who found the ETP wrapper served their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Data shows that some investors bought their first ETP in Bitcoin ETPs and are now diversifying into other ETPs, helping build more customized portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Cohen emphasizes that an ideal future involves crypto rails and the crypto financial ecosystem developing in an integrated way with existing, functional systems, rather than aiming for complete disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Evaluating ETF Success and Market Trends

### Misconceptions in the Crypto Market

There are two main misconceptions in the crypto world regarding ETPs:
1.  **Ether ETFs were less successful than Bitcoin ETFs:** By ETF industry standards, Ether ETFs had "really successful launches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
2.  **Creating an ETF drives flows:** Investor sentiment, not the ETF itself, drives flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Bitcoin's investment thesis in 2024 was more tangible than Ether's, explaining the disparity in flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. While Bitcoin ETPs broke all ETF records, the Ether ETP was still in the top 20% of US ETF launches for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Metrics of Success for ETFs

For BlackRock, a successful ETF:
*   **Delivers what it's supposed to:** It tracks the underlying index with absolute precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Demonstrates high market quality:** This includes strong trading volumes, liquidity, and on-exchange access, facilitated by authorized participants who create and redeem ETF shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Both Bitcoin and Ether ETPs have achieved high market quality and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Bitcoin's Investment Thesis in 2025

The investment thesis for Bitcoin in late 2024 and heading into [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | 2025]] is driven by its narrative as digital gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Key factors include:
*   **Geopolitical tension:** heightened global instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Broad-based disruptions:** concerns over wider economic and social upheavals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Dollar deficits:** worries about the US dollar's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** After a challenging 2022 where both stocks and bonds declined, investors are seeking alternatives to diversify traditional 60/40 equity-bond portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Bitcoin is seen as a potential diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

In contrast, the Ether story is often seen by investors as "less of a diversifier and more of an amplifier" to existing mega-cap tech exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## BlackRock's Research and Outlook for 2025

BlackRock does not provide investment advice but publishes investment research rooted in portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Bitcoin Allocation Recommendations

BlackRock has written research on Bitcoin in a portfolio context, highlighting its potential diversification aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. For investors interested in incorporating Bitcoin, a 1-2% allocation was found to provide the same level of risk contribution as a "MAG 7 stock" (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Google), without exponentially increasing overall portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Exceeding 2% would indicate a very strong, specific view on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

### [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | Goals for 2025]] for Crypto ETPs

Samara Cohen outlines several key objectives for the Bitcoin and Ether ETPs in [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | 2025]]:
1.  **Shift in Conversation:** Move from "Bitcoin or not Bitcoin" to "how Bitcoin is manifesting in the portfolio" â€“ where it's useful and where it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
2.  **More Data and Integration:** Continued market cycles will provide more data, making it easier to integrate Bitcoin into broader conversations about risk and asset return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
3.  **Options Ecosystem Development:** The launch of options on Bitcoin ETPs is a significant step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Options ecosystems generally create more balanced trading dynamics and enhance market quality by providing transparency into investor sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. They also allow investors to tailor exposures and manage downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

Options provide new levels of transparency and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. Historically, many institutional investors first engaged with exchange-traded funds through options, which allowed for limited capital outlay and downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### BlackRock's Future Plans for Digital Asset ETPs

BlackRock's near-term strategy for digital asset ETPs remains focused on Bitcoin and Ether, aligning with current client interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. The firm's broader digital assets strategy extends beyond new ETPs to pillars such as:
*   [[The_future_of_stablecoins_and_implications_for_global_finance | Stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>
*   Tokenization (e.g., of Treasury funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>

BlackRock prioritizes rooting ETP launches in a clear investment thesis and client demand, rather than anticipating price appreciation solely from the launch itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Bitcoin's unique investment thesis stems from its scarcity, finite supply, and role as a borderless store of value, which is easier to understand than the more complex investment theses of other tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

### Regulatory Outlook for [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | 2025]]

With an incoming US Administration positioned as more "free markets" and "pro markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>, BlackRock is optimistic for a more innovation-supportive regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. Hopes for [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | 2025]] regulation include:
*   **Establishment of Basics:** Clear definitions (e.g., what constitutes a security) and clarification of jurisdiction (who is the regulator responsible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Effective regulation will require collaboration between the public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.
*   **Interoperability:** More work around interoperability is expected to allow TradFi market experts to play a larger role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

Cohen notes that a lack of regulation or guardrails can undermine investor confidence, which is crucial for the market's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. BlackRock generally favors open architecture and interoperability, which is essential for operating at scale, and has publicly leaned towards public rather than permissioned blockchains for tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

### Internal Collaboration at BlackRock

BlackRock's digital assets team, led by Robbie Mitnik, works horizontally across the firm, educating various business units (ETFs, index trading, securities lending, derivatives) on potential use cases for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This approach encourages businesses to commit to and partner with the digital assets team, ensuring that crypto solutions are adopted when they are truly the "right tool for the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

### Outlook

Cohen expresses optimism for [[2025_crypto_market_predictions | 2025]], with a focus on addressing regulatory uncertainty and channeling energy towards creating a more transparent and accessible financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. The goal is to move past the "anger at the system" and focus on the mission to "espouse what is so good about blockchain and crypto" and bring the industry into its "golden era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

The concept of "internet capital markets" has become a recent meme on crypto Twitter, broadly defined as consumer apps launching tokens and "slapping them together" with their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This trend is driven by platforms like Believe and its token, Launchcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, aiming to enable capital formation for new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## The Rise of Launchcoin and Believe

Launchcoin has seen significant gains, rising 1,000% in 24 hours and a total of 1,500% over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The associated app, Believe, was previously known as Clout.me and focused on social tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The core idea is to allow users to create coins for products or apps by simply tweeting at a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### How it Works
A key feature of the Believe platform is a 1% trading fee, half of which goes directly to the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This model allows creators to fund their apps through memecoin trading activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The primary draw is that developers are incentivized to generate trading fees, rather than dumping their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Notable examples include:
*   **Jelly Jelly**: An early iteration of this model from January, reaching a $200 million market cap in a day before declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Dupe**: An AI app that finds cheaper "dupes" of desired items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. It is the largest market cap coin on Believe outside of Launchcoin itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Its creator is actively exploring how to provide value to token holders, such as giving fees back in Dupecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Gooncoin**: A pure memecoin that has risen to a $50 million market cap, demonstrating how these platforms can quickly devolve back to traditional memecoins, regardless of their initial "utility" premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Critiques and Comparisons to Other Launchpads
Critics view these new platforms as "memecoins slapped on a different wrapper," simply attracting a different group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The core issue remains regulatory hurdles, as these tokens offer "no promise of equity" and "no claim to anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The ideal, yet currently unachievable, outcome is the ability to launch truly tokenized equity with clear token holder rights and incentive alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

This trend of "internet capital markets" or different "flavors of token launchpads" is creating competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   [[pump_token_launchpad_and_the_future_of_token_creation | Pump Fun]] is a primary competitor, professionalizing the memecoin launch process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
*   BonkFun and Radium have also emerged, with Radium positioned as a "launchpad launcher" that allows others to create branded launchpads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. BonkFun notably commits most of its fees to buying back Bonkcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
*   In terms of fees, Launch Lab (Radium) and [[pump_token_launchpad_and_the_future_of_token_creation | Pump Fun]] are nearly equal in 24-hour fees, while Radium's Automated Market Maker (AMM) doubles [[pump_token_launchpad_and_the_future_of_token_creation | Pump Fun]]'s swap volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Ultimately, the market for token launches is expected to become more efficient, with fees compressing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

## Market Impact and Future Outlook
The proliferation of memecoin launchpads on Solana has led to capital dispersion rather than value accrual solely into the Solana token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This parallels the effect of Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum, where capital was dispersed across L2s instead of being concentrated in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Some argue that memecoins are "actively bad" for Solana due to sell pressure from fees not being reinvested into the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

Despite the current "silly and stupid" nature of some launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, the trend indicates a strong appetite from crypto participants to invest in "pseudo-equity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This highlights the potential for the crypto space to serve as a strong funding mechanism for builders and founders, even if scams occur along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The challenge remains to bridge the "memecoin pseudo-equity gap" and establish proper capital structuring and incentive alignment for teams and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
